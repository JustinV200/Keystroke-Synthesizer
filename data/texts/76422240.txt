Turn on an video channel, social media page or tv and you'll be inundated with ads or promos for products. Even on youtube channels, tik-tok videos and instagram reels, people are promoting the next thing. It begs the question: do we need this much stuff?

The answer is no. Society today is much too materialistic. From fast fashion, to one use plastics, the world is quickly filling up with junk. Not only is this bad for the environment but for our mental and physical health as well. We get jealous when someone has more stuff, better stuff, cooler stuff. We buy houses that are too big to fill with our stuff and often cut down trees and displace local wildlife to do so. Despite a declining population, we have more options for shopping now than we ever have. And it's mostly crap. A lot of it is coming out of china for a cheap price, and you definitely get what you pay for. Most of it ends up in landfills. It's not recycleable, you can't thrift or reuses it because of the quality and the footprint is large from being shipped from overseas. It all needs to stop.

Some people might argue that we need more stuff to account for the extra free time we've aquired as a society. We don't have to make everything from scratch anymore, so we can do more with our days. Theres plenty of ways to entertain yourself without buying more things. Or we could go back to making things ourselves again.
 
In conclusion, I would like to say this; the human race would do so much better if we were doing instead of buying. Go out for a walk, make your own clothes, volunteer your time. See a therapist if you feel like material goods are the only way to make you feel happy. Just, try to seperate your feelings from your possessions.
