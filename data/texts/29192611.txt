Yes modern society  should be criticized for being materialistic.

In olden days there has been value of money ,all pepole were caution about it.
they dont buy unnescessary stuff.all were united and happy.they spend some quality time with family and friends.
Bur recent modern days they dont know the value of money,In home all peope they dont even talk just engaged with modern techonologies like mobilr,pc,laptop etc
this lead many problem in the society.
All childrens are not playing in the ground or having fun with their friends.
they dont even talk with their family members in their home.always engaging with digital media.Their interest in this lead them to wrong path.their future are darkened.
Even a parents are not interested to talk share their happiness and sorrows then how come childern do? In these days they are willing to out of home ,spend money lavishly and buy unnecessary stuff of not use.This make them happy.
Even education has changed  no moral values are teached.There is no self disiciplined among  students.
As said TODAYS STUDENTS ARE TOMORROW'S LEADER
