Whether or not images and impressions have too much effect on people is an interesting question. We often find ourselves wondering if something is real or as good as it appears.

The problem is, of course, one of perception. And further, whether subjective perception constitutes reality or whether some objective measure should be our guide. Of course, any combination of the two is often possible.

In the end, we have to accept that what we percieve as reality is a result of images and impressions. If we see a green cow, while our friends see the same animal as red, the green cow remains our reality, regardless of whether we think our friends may be right or not.

So the question of whether images have too much of an effect on people is a philisophical one and not a concrete one. We find ourselves trapped in a reality of our perception, able only to imagine - and not experience - what those same perceptions are for other people. Whether this means that perception has "too much" of an effect on us is kind of meaningless, since it is the only reality that we have. Does the pretty package invite us to purchase the product inside? Of course. But you could argue that buying the pretty package is part of an entire experience, rather than the package and the products being separate things. Just as a meal may smell, taste, and look good, so may a product be satisfying on several levels. We enjoy the meal in its entirety - the looks or smell aren't tricks played by a clever chef to fool us into enjoying the meal. We enjoy the entire experience.

In the end, what we have is what we're able to perceive. To say this has "too much" effect on our thinking is to ask us to somehow live outside of our own universe. We perceive what we perceive and, like it or not, that is our personal truth.
