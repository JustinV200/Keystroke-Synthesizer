Don't you think that we usually find better success by using cooperation?  In this cut dry world the phrase "can't we all just get along" somewhat tends to bind us to seek help amongst others to get things done at a quicker and much more successful rate.  Or is that the rationality that we should be using, that more makes better?

Cooperation is what keeps harmony in so many situations.  In a world that seems to be at this time a place of separation, why not work together to get our achievements? Not that one has to have a stance for protest, but when people come together as one to take a stance there is a true sense of engagement as one.  This produces likeminded effects for a solution.  Cooperation allows one to sit together and discuss what one wants the end point to be.  Being along side another in cooperation allows one to pick up another in case one falls.

However, there are some that may disagree and say that competition makes things so much more livelier!  After all doesn't competition create a rivarly and push everyone to do their best? Competition can be a driving point to see who finishes first and best.  It is a word that makes some put their nose to pillar and push and what keeps some going.  Just the word competition creates in the mind a reving of the spirits!

The central idea is that we live in a dog eats dog world.  It is so much better when we can find ways to achieve our successes by working side by side with one another in cooperation.  It makes for a bond when we collectively sit down together and find ways to achieve common goals as one.  It makes for a learning of others as we learn of ourselves in talking plans and ideas out amongst one another.  Let's go out and be cooperative with others and get some things done!
