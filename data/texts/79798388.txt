Do you know where happiness comes from, beacause many people struggle to find it. Some people believe happiness comes from accomplishing goals while other believe happiness comes from helping others. This is what we are going to explor in this essay so read along and find out what makes people happy.

First lets starts with finding happiness by accomplishing goals. Lets say you want to be a photographer so you study really hard and you become one of the best but now what? Once you accomplish your goal to become a photographer whats going to keep you happy, another goal? If you keep making new goals and keep succeding is that going to keep you happy because accomplishing a goal only keeps you happy for so long.

Now lets talk about focusing on making other people happy. Lets say you see a friend having a bad day so you decide to bring then some hot coffee and you get to see a bright smile on their face as they thank you. I believe simple acts of kindness can not only brighten someones else day but also brighten your own because you are doing a selfless act. So is that the anser to happiness or is it accomplishing your own goals?

I do not believe happiness comes from one place I berlieve its a little of both accomplishing your own goals and making others happy: you just need a proper balance. Life is not just about focusing on goals alone or only helping others to be happy its about expirencing both.  Too much of a good thing can become a bad thing so, lets focus on goals and help other along the way.
