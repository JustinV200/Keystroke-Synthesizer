For my main topic of discussion I shall be diving into a very relevant topic today, This topic consists of a modern day question of "Do images and impressions have to much effect on people and their minds. My take on this question is that images and visual triggers have a large effect on how people not only view products, but theirselves aswell. I will break down how effective these images are and if it is a concern for everyone, or just for a small few.

Images play a big roll on modern day society because they are everywhere and we can't escape them even if we want to. With constant exposure to targeted ads in the media, it is only natural that we become effected by this constant stimuli. If we see something everyday, especially repetitive content, then it will more than likely effect us mentally or in some rare cases physically. It causes us to believe we are something we are not and lose touch with reality. It will have people admiring singers and song writers that do not hold any real practical worth. These writers and singers have a greater public image than their own abilities.

Not all individuals are constantly being effected by images, but that is mostly due to where they live in the world. A farmer that does not go into the city very often does not have the same level of exposure to images and visual triggers as a young business professional that has a job in the big city. These images may not effect everyone the same, but they are shown to us eventually depending on where you live.

It is easy for one to lose touch with reality when they are bombarded with social stimuli everyday. They are the type of people that aspire to be famous rockstars just because they saw someone in an ad that was one as well. These ads, images, and flashy lights are not going anywhere, and unfortunatly that means that this feeling of being out of touch with reality is here to stay as a result.
