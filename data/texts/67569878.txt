Couches, rugs, Loius Vitton shoes and insanely priced handbags are just a few of the materialistic things today's society strives to achieve ownership of.  Not one single item in that list is necessary to survive in this world.  And yet, half the world is covered in shops and malls that sell these things to consumers.  I wonder how the caveman lived without a Waterford crystal lamp to light his "home"?  I also wonder how it was to live without the anxiety-inducing electric bill that I, myself, receive every month.  It must have been a bit like Heaven.  

So how did we get to the point where decorations for our homes and our bodies became more important than say, the hungry man on the street corner, holding up his sign pleading for help?  Because most people would pass that fellow human up to head into the Starbucks further down the street.  They could have made the decision to give that almost $7 they were going to spend on a fancy coffee to that hungry man.  Those kinds of people are ignored by society, though, because they don't have enough "stuff" to fit in with everyone else.

Yes, televisions make us happy.  We get to watch people who have even more "stuff" than us act out their dreams.  A nice big house is lovely to keep out the critters that used to plague the people of the past.  We can compare it to our neighbor's house or even a family member's house to gague who is more successful in life. Also, indoor plumbing is something I never want to give up.  But what does all this say about us as a society?  We don't care about each other when that is all we should be doing.  That is what materialism says and we should definitely be criticized for it.
