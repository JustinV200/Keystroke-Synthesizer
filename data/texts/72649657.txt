What is happiness? How do we attain happiness? Is there a right way to look for happiness? These are the questions of our age; perhaps the questions of every age. So it is a very important topic to consider and think about carefully.

I believe that happiness stems most of all from a clarity of thought; that is, knowing exactly what you want and how to go about it. If one grasps aimlessly for happiness (or most other things), one is very unlikely to stumble upon it. Instead, happiness depends on having specific goals in mind. It's the only way you'll know yourself and in doing so, know happiness.

One's individal goals in achieving that happiness are, to me, less important than knowing how to go about it. If your happiness comes from helping others, that's all well and good. If your happiness comes fron achieving personal success, that's fine too. But it's important to be aware that the path your on is truly the best way to get you want, and what is needed to achieve happiness.

Some will say that happiness is elusive, something you stumble into more than anything else. I would say that this is very uncommon and unsustainable. Only clarity of thought and surity of purpose brings lasting fulfillment. Those who contend otherwise, to me, are just making excuses for their own unhappiness. Saying happiness is random is just too easy.

It's not easy. Knowing one's self is perhaps the most difficult thing of all, because it involves coming to terms with one's own nature. But all this is essential to achieving happiness. If you know what you want, know how you can achieve it, and know how it will fulfill you, happiness is a clear, if not always easy road to walk.
