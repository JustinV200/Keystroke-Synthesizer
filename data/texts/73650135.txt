Yes. Modern society be criticized for being materialistic.
Materialistic for me is so bad that we dont care what is going on around us. We keep seeking for the satisfactions of our wants instead of our needs. It is a me, me, me generation. We dont think of what's gonna be the future of the next generations.
Our mother earth is suffering too much of the existence of industrialization.

We have to remember when the values of America deteriorate the sought after wealth and materialistic goods becomes unattainable anyway. Wealth is the disciplined application of values we apply on a daily basis to reach our goals. When we turned our back on our values all our plans are evaporate.

Sad to say that our belief system has changed. It  has changed so much that we dont care anymore. Our morals is detriorating and we are watching it happening right in front of our eyes. I feel sad for the next generations. Most of our kids don't even know what cauliflower plants look like. We are so industrialized that we want easy and quick fix for everthing we do. 

Being materialistic is a temporary thing and it is not sustainable. It is like an addiction. We consume, buy and spend things that we dont need. In fact some of us go in debt for buying things that we dont need. It is a sad reality of today's generations. We lost touch of the nature. We don't intertwine with the wonderful world created for us! We lost the natural balance of our existence. I am praying that one day a new minds with a fresh ideas will evolve.
