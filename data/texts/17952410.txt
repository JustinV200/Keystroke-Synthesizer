Nothing inherently wrong with human, but there is something wrong with the way we approach seeking contentment. 

Materialistic this term can signify different things to different people. Spending a significant amount of money on irrational and unnecessary items that the owner dosen't care about is what it means to me. He acts in this way merely out of habit. If actions are taken merely for their own sake, then this culture has become overly materialistic.

A acquaintance of mine loved to collect hand paintings. She in adaotable in her collecting methods and does so anytime she comes across artworks in local and international locations. She dosen't merely collect paintings and set them aside, she does this out of love and respect for them. This illustrates the difference between having a passion for something and being materialistic.

The good news is that those pinceless items can bring delight to materialistic individuals. Only purchase what you truly need. However, most materialistic people do not desire that. They keep needing more. Even if you offer them anything as a gift, they might dump it in the trash. Therefore, materialism leads to selfishness. 

There is a proverb that states, "The rightly fashioned existence of a nice persone is the most beautiful thing in this universe." Every member of the society in which we live has the right to be critical of its materialism. Therefore, carry out your actions with intention rather than only for selfish reasons.
