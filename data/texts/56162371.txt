As an individual we all are different, whether it be the way we look or our personality. 
People come in all forms, shapes, and sizes, would you agree? What a person's personalitly, have you really thought about that? Personalitlies can come in all forms, shapes, and sizes too. What may drive one person may do the oppiste to the other. Do people achieve more sucess by cooperation or by competition? How would you know which path to take when encouraging an individual not to avoid failure or achieve a goal.

Since individual's are different and unique taking the right approach to motiate someone would take a little time to assess the individual as one. There are two types of people. Type A personality tends to be more competetive where as Type B personality tends to give up and not push foward to achieve a goal. Whether it be type A or B personalitly there is still ways to encourge the person to achieve whatever they set their mind to, however it is said that cooperation is much more likely to produce significant, lasting accomplishments. 

As stated earlier no two indivduals are alike. It may seem challenging at first, but over time you definitley can gain trust in someone. Building a rapport is the most important. Once you have trust in someone regardless of personality type you will have their buy in. For instance, type A personality is usually one of the hardest to gain trust with from my experience. Type B has always been the easiest for me to persaude. Let's revisit the topic, do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? 

Cooperation would probably be the best approach in my personal opinion. If you know your audience, their personalitly and are willing to put the effort in to get their buy in isn't cooperation the best path to take.
