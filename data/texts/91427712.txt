It's my belief that cooperation is a more worthwhile endeavor. While rivalry may seem like it spurs on others, no one person can be a master of all aspects.

We live in a world where there are literally billions of others to collude with rather than collide with. If everyone were in fact on the same team how amazing would that be. An overall hierarchy where everyone is valued no matter how small. While it might seem a fantasy like perspective, the world has resources for everyone if everyone were to share.

I could wake up today and say "Hey I have this great idea!", and openly share it without fear of another person immediately becoming a competitor. There's a large amount of the global wealth held in the hands of a few, while there are others scrounging for scraps in comparison.

As we continue to grow, we have the ability to help others, to guide others, and to leave our mark on others, so when our time to expire comes, we expire but also leave some parts of ourself behind in the influence of others. I would rather live and give all that I am and know others are invested to the same degree. I'm not living to wage war with another, but rather to benefit the world which has selflessly given to me.
