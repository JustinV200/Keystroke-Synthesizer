Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. The reason being is that having material possessions can lead to a form of happiness. Many of us can agree that material items do not guarantee happiness, but the experiences made with them can be. Having a karaoke machine at a family party can create some unforgettable memories during a holiday get together. 

Using a high end camera to capture unique moments during a vacation can create another memory that will last a lifetime. It is definitely possible for us as a society to become consumed by our possessions. We see it in our day to day lives with the amount of cell phone use and online shopping that is being done. This is why it is so important for us as people to find a happy medium. 

A life without balance can impact our emotions and have an overall affect on how we spend our day. Taking the time to enjoy the smaller aspects of life is what helps to make the times where we do focus on materialism so much more meaningful. Not having it be the core reason for our existence is what allows us to happily function with those who are materialistic and those who are not.
