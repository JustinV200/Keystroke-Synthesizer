We have  confused by our impression on others but at the same time it is other people's behavior and action . So , don't judge people on their own behavior. My friend used to have a girl friend who was enchating with a constant smile . She never has sympathy for the poor people and she laughs at those injured animals this make me so bad about her . I don't like her for this behavior and I don't ever act like her.
 
The impression of one person is not important . Those who have a good and kind hearted person is more important than the good apperance of a bad minded people. So , be a good hearted person and help others . Those who need money or cloth or food do some help for them and make them feel happy and joy. Don't waste money on buying costly things like iphone or buying any brandes items and buy a normal items in street shops . Don't bargain on street shopping workers . They are so poor and working for thier family . So , don't play with thier lives.

So , the last thing is there is no bad impression on people who have dirty face or dirty cloth . Only see thier good heart and be a good human in the earth. If you want to live happy help the poor and make them happy you will have a heaven life throughout the life.

My grandma always donate a such amount for the homeless children . Now she lives her end of the life peacefully because of doing such good things in her life . So , she feels happy .
