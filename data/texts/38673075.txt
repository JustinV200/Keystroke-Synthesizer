Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? That is the question we all ask ourself. May people live for the competition. Being able to beat someone either a rivalry or a total stranger. I believe believe are more successful if they achive success by cooperation.

Cooperation is something that we all have to do everyday. Either in our job, school or just plan life. If we don't cooperate with other we could put ourselves or other in damage. Think of yourself on a team. What happens if you are on that team and you don't cooperate with your teammates. If you are a team of firefighters and you don't work together you could kill the people you are their to safe or even yourself. Cooperation is what leads to the success. They work together to help the people who are out there in harms way.

Cooperation is what helps all of us get through life. If I didn't have the cooperation of my husband I don't know if I could handle my son who we just found out had ADHD. We are more successful working as a team to help him then we are trying to both handle it along. I know that there are parents that do have to, but having a team to help you allows you to have someone to look after you in the time that you need it. No one should ever have to fight or deal with something alone.

Cooperation the process of working together to the same end. This is something we deal with every day. It is either to deal with things when you have people to deal with things with you. So as I said before people achieve more success with cooperation. As none of us can do things alone and we shouldn't have to.
