Our society often places a lot of importance on the outer packaging of people and things and less importance on inner qualities. We see an obsession with selfies, and image filters because image has become even more important than content to many people. This has too much influence on our lives and is a reflection of the shortened attention span of our society and moral decay.

Apps like Snapchat and TikTok capture our minds with constant stimulation and then cause us to be bored with more effortful activities like reading an article, a book or even playing a board game. This is not harmless because this will eventually result in lower test scores for students who may not be able to concentrate as well on their studies. This is also harmful for many adults who may not be able to process news reports beyond 30 second snippets, making us a more uninformed and more vulnerable population that will not be able to govern themselves nor select good government. How would our governments and our media be different if we looked beyond outer appearances?

Some argue that this new tech helps people to communicate faster, therefore increasing our knowledge and our speed. I argue that because of the speed and lack of depth of the knowledge received, this knowledge is not retained for very long. The result is we often don't remember what happened yesterday, let alone a year ago. Because of our obsession with appearances, we're after the next shiny object being blasted across social media. In conclusion, our obsession with surface appearances is destroying our attention spans and our society as a whole.
