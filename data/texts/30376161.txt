Well personally I don't deal well with compatition. But as far as to all people?

I think the world is divede in 2 goups of people when it comes to how people achive succsess.
They  are most of the wold, who are limited, who don't belive in them selfes, who are too lazy to sucseed.
Then, there isthe small goup that have cracked the code. They know exsactly what to do and when, they are not lazy, they over belive in themself even wehn others don't, they don't feel limited at all.
I think most people today will agree with me. However, we can not ignor the many different ways and opinions about how to get there. 

Well, I know, opinions of people can be as different as we are. 
Some people think listening to a succsessful person road and expiriancess will make them too successful. But I belive we all have a way to succsessed of we only make the best out of ouselfs.

Some people intrepartet success in different ways too. some people say their succsess is their family,some people say its their welth, some say its their carrer or their perpes.

After all if there was one sertain way or belive we would probably all know it by now.
Well, all we have left to do is to choose our best way possible.

Maybe it is the combination that will do the trick? Maybe compatition in cooperation is good?
I can relate to want to creat somthing for your self, I understand also the need for structure and stability. at the end how a person see his success will detarmain the outcome.

So my aswer, to this extreamly interasting and important quastion for every adult alive today, may be confusing a bit, but I just don't see one way to success.
some will thrive in competiton and some will thrive in coopration.
