People in modern society can be very judgemental. One topic that seems to be highly criticized is materialism. Wether you stand on the side of materialistic or not the fact remains that it is a common part of every day life to acquire things. Some may say that a minimal lifestyle is best, while others argue that money and things bring them true happiness.

I believe that money plays a big role in ones comfort. While I don't consider myself to be materialistic, some may. It all depends really, I think, on one's own spending habbits how they judge others. There are many items that do bring me joy, but there are also many things that don't cost a dime that also make me really happy. Such as spending time with family and friends. 

That being said it takes money to raise a family. As well as things to keep us alive. So I don't think that it's fair for people to be judged for how they choose to spend their money, or what makes them happy. Everyone is different and wants to be happy or comfortable. If you have the means and buying oversized homes makes you happy, then so be it. If you enjoy living a minimal lifestyle and prefer to not aquire things, then so be it. Who are we to judge those around us? 

We shouldn't judge other people on being materialistic or not cause we don't know their means or needs. The things that make us happy may not satisify the next person. And it's everyone's right in life to enjoy themselves while being a productive part of society. People are already criticized enough for variety of things. It doesn't help to be judgemental of things that have nothing to do with us and aren't within our control.
