Materialism. This is something that found all over the world. What exactly does it mean to be materialistic? Does it mean you're spending money in efforts to buy your own happiness or could it be something more? Does being materialistic really matter in the end. Does it actually make you happy, and is it a good thing to be considered materialistic, or should modern society be criticized for it?

Let's start with what makes you materialistic. To be considered materialistic you have a want to buy all the latest gadgets or clothes or anything that is trending to make you feel relevent or get you popularity. If you think back to when you were in school there would always be people that always stayed caught up to the latest trends, whether it came to clothes, shoes, electronics, or any other gadgets. Those people were typically the more popular kids that had money to get those things, while other kids that weren't as fortunate with money didn't have those things. 

Here's the question though, which one was actually happy? Were the kids that had money and was able to get whatever they wanted happy, or the kids who weren't able to have material things, in return had to create their own happiness. I guess it really depends on the person, but I do believe that either one can be happy. Is it neccesary to have material things to be happy, no. Should society also be criticized for being materialistic? Also no. Because while it isn't neccesary to be materialistic to be happy, it does make some people happy, and anything that makes a person truly happy is a good thing.
