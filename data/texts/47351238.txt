The true meaning of happiness has been debated since the beginning of time and I've been trying to find the answer myself.  There are different theories to finding happiness, which include finding inner happiness, finding happiness through others, or a combination of both.  I believe that every person can find happiness through different ways and there is not one single way to find happiness.  It is different for every person and the journey is not easy.

I personally believe that most people will find happiness by finding inner peace.  People need to be content with themselves, how they conduct themselves, their relationships with others, but most importantly how they feel about themselves.  Some people may not feel this way, but I know for me, I have to find ways to accept who I am and what I value in life to be happy.

Some people may believe that they need to find happiness by being wealthy.  Some believe they need to find love.  Others believe that happiness isn't even possible.  It's really person dependent on what they believe.

In conclusion, there is no answer that is right for everyone when it comes to happiness.  Some find it within, some find it by helping others, some don't believe in happiness, and others need a combination of a lot of different things to happen in their lives.  There will never be a true answer for all, but there is an answer for each person respectively.
