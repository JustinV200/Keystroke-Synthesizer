Growing up, my dad taught me a very important lesson on sucess. He never let me win at any board games or video games, I had to get better. One day I woke up, I started to give him a run for his money, and I realized everything is better when you make a competition out of life. Now at 26 years old, my competativeness has reached the house I share with my boyfriend, who also pushes me to be my best. I firmly believe that success is easier and more rewarding through competition.

Cooperation may seem like the better way to achieve success, but you have to split the credit in most cases.  Through competition, you have a chance to improve yourself and find what drives you. Competition is what drives every business in the world. Without Wendy's, Mcdonalds has no reason to push new products and the lifestyle that comes with dining at Mcdonalds. There would be no commercials bashing other companies and pushing those same companies to up their ante as well.

We push the limits thanks to competition, the sports world would not be where it is today.  People live for competition between teams. Thats why people go to see the Cincinnti Bengals and Joey Burrow beat down more than half the league, its the competition and the atmophere competition creates. 

More often than not, people want competition. they need it even. It is what got us to the moon, its what gave rise to the age of technology. We need to stay competative so the world doesn't burn and our future generations here in the USA can have what we never had. That can only be achieved through competition. The race to find cheaper alternatives to oil and gasoline. The race to Mars.  We may cooperate on the national level, but we will always be competing with other countrys in the grand scheme of things. The world will never agree on everything and the world will always be trying to say "I did it first". It will never change, so cooperation isn't always the best answer, but competition will be for generations.
