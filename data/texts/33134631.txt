         Most people think that focusing on and achieving their personal goals gives them pleasure and fulfilment in life. But we forget about our family and friends in the process of achieving our own goals. However, our personal goals only give us happiness in our life.
         Everyone has their own dreams. Everyone worked for thier own dreams. Others didn't give up thier goals for you. Likewise, we also didn't give up our goals for others, even for our loved once. Sometimes focusing on our own goals will make us happy when someone has love for us. Some people weren't happy about our achievements. We didn't want to worry about them. It was an unneccessary kindness.
         If we focused on our personal goals, it will lead to success in our lives. Success will make you rich. You can make others happy by your riches. But if we focused on making others happy, we might missed achieving our own goals. You can't make people happy all time. So it will hurt both you and others. making others happy is not a parmanent happiness. Our personal goals only gives the permanent happiness.
         It was not a selfish statement. We don't need to be regret about it. Everyone in the world thought about it same.
