Media and advertisements have a way of warping our perceptions. Who someone seems on television or the internet is not always who they are beneath the surface. Plenty of advertisements promote and publicize products that are devoid of ethics. Images and impressions have far too much of an effect on individuals.

Ellen Degeneres was once America's sweetheart. Her televised talkshow attracted thousands of viewers, and her online presence was staggering. Viewers, regardless of age, knew and admired Ellen. However, this facade has been shattered in the last few years.  It came to light that Ellen wasn't as kind as media  portrayed her to be. From verbally abusing staff to being a nightmare on set, the truth about her behavior was coming to the surface. Ellen is the perfect example of a public figure touted by the media for a profit who was truly not who she appeared to be. What appears on the outside is not always what lies within in these industries.

Handcrafted alkaline water. Now only $50. Promoted and hyped by MTV and other media, there is nothing special about designer waterr. So why is it selling in droves? The Bling Golden Drip water bottle by Bling H2O is even less impressive than it sounds. This frosted bottle of water is dripping in gold Swarovski Crystals. The outside is flashy, but its contents are sorely lacking. One might buy a bottle of Poland Springs and recieve an identical product.

Favorable impressions and intriguing packages are used to draw in consumers who are attracted to appearance. When one purchases a product or admires a celebrity, it's not always for the correct reasons. Media and advertisements create false narratives and hide behind bright, colorful packages while hiding the truth from those on the outside. People are bamboozled and scammed everyday as appearances are mistaken for reality.
