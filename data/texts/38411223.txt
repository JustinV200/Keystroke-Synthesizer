The modern society should not get criticized for being materialistic. Our earth is too old and thus it became a modern one now. Our previous generations have saw a lot more than us before and invented many things to make our daily needs easier one. People's life started with dark and then they invented fire which helped them to protect themselves and to make new different things. On this way, they invented new things one by one from what they have invented before.

Our future generations will get more than what we have today. We are developing new things everyday and using thim which will help our scientists to modify them as per the future needs. They are spending more money on inventions to protect us from bad things and to make our everyday life an easier one. Our people are trying to live a happy life through spending money on things that they love. They want their loved ones to be happy and safe. 

For that, they are investing on many things. Our today's interest on materials will help our future generations to led a happy and safe life. It will make them strong enough to handle things. People are materialistic to live a happy life, so there's nothing wrong with that.
