People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals rather than if they were to focus on the happiness of others. This is due to the fact that we can only control ourselves. We cannot control others. Instead, we can only accept what is.

Individuals only have control over themselves. We cannot control others. We can only accept what is. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood of success if we were to focus our energy on pursing our own personal goals. We choose what is important to us and how much energy we want to devote to that particular goal. Our success or failure in achieving a goal, solely lies within us. We may not always succeed on the first try, but we decide how much effort and how many attempts we make. 

Others feel that you would be happier by investing in the happiness of others. While your intentions may be pure, you cannot dictate how someone receives your actions. Your attempts to make someone else happy will not always be successful. There are several reasons for this. This could be the result of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation, difference in taste, change in taste, irritable mood, bad timing, or a host of different other things. 

People are more likely to achieve happiness if they were to focus their energies on pursuing their own personal goals. We have no control over others and we definitely cannot control how their receive our actions. Relying on the happiness of others to determine our own will only result in failure and frustration. It is only when we focus on the things within our control that we can achieve true happiness.
