Every day, people log into social media, and they view the profiles of their friends, celebrities, and co-workers. Although they may feel that they are getting a glimpse into the lives of those people, they really aren't. However, the feelings that arise from seeing these perfectly curated images and the impressions they take from them can have lasting effects.

People tend to compare themselves to others--it's just a fact. Social media has taken this far beyond "keeping up with the Joneses" and moved it online, so that one can compare themselves with just about anyone in the world with a social media account. Is your marriage floundering? Well, your friends sure look in love. Are you struggling to get a job? Your friend just got promoted. Feeling inadequate? Well, these celebrities are here to remind you that you probably are. Although the moments shared certainly look enviable, it is not real life. One must step back and remind themselves what reality really is.

Everyone goes through struggles each day, but these are rarely documented for the world to see. One's impression of others is, more often than not, what those others wish for them to see. When looking at someone's digital life, we must remember that everyone experiences ups and downs, but not everyone likes to show their warts. When comparing one's everyday experiences with others, it's really an apples to oranges comparison.

Although social media, news, and celebrities can all be fun to follow, it's important to remember what really matters: the day-to-day life with one's family and friends. And while this may not always be Instagram-worthy, it's real life. And that's something that no image or impression on social media can ever replicate.
