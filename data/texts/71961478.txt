        There are many negative things that we as a society have become. We try to find anything that will excuse these things away. The harsh reality is that we have done it to ourselves. Even so, can we really be criticized and blamed for it? I'm talking about how materialistic we are said to have become. Personally, I don't think we are any more materialistic than humans were at any other period of time. I intened to explain to you why that is.
       One of the biggest reasons why I feel we cannot be judged for wanting more and more things. And thinking who we are should be based on what items we have. Is becasue we're wired to think that way. Our minds have us always wanting more. Studies have shown this is the case. Because of this hard wiring in our brains. We are always looking for the next thing a obtain. Thinking it will make us happier once we have it. Once we do and that euphoria for the item is gone. We are on to the next thing that will make us happy. 
       It's understandably easy for someone to point a finger at another and claim they are not like that person. That they don't have to have items as badly as another. Even though we are wired the same. We aren't raised the same. We don't all have the same idea of what things are worth more than something else. But we do all have an idea of what we need to acquire in order for our status or happiness to be elevated. I can see how easily someone could downplay their need for things.
      We are all materialistic. Someone could feel having the newest phone, car, tech device or even just a new garden hose is what they need to feel acomplished or happy. It doesn't matter the cost or size of the item. We all strive for something that will make us feel better. It's who we are. Can you really judge an entire race for being something they really have no control over? I feel that is similar to judging someone on where they were born or the color of their skin.
