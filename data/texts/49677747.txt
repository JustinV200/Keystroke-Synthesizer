Materialism is a trait that was used for survival in the past, and has now evolved to acquiring possessions and spending money. While there are both negative and positive aspects to this quality, it is ultimately needed for modern society, therefore modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. 

Materialism is good for society because it allows for the economy to flourish. When buying products, it creates jobs and increases the revenue, which is then put back into the community. For example, buying an expensive purse gives businesses the means to keep their employees, as well as, creates jobs for the materials that go into making the purse. 

As mentioned materialism can also be negative, as many people spend their energy on consuming as many things as they can. Due to this, materialism can be associated with greed and unhappiness. While this may be true, it also leads to fulfillment and happiness. Buying the things that you really want will make a person feel as if they have everything they need for a good life.

In conclusion, modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. This is not only good for the economy, but for a person's fulfillment and happiness in life. There are negative aspects to this, but it is better having more things than to have nothing at all.
