In todays society everyone has an electronic device where they can access millions of pictures within an instant. Many of these pictures portray products, people, or environments in their best lightning, and often times even edited. People become so impressioned by these pictures that they go out and buy all of the products because they believe if they use what their favority influencer is using they'll look like them. But there's more to the story. 

The influencers, businesses, and products don't talk about the 3 hours in lightroom photo editor they spent finding the perfect preset for those shots, they don't talk about the little warning on the back of the product that says results may be atypical. All of the things being portrayed have become so one sided. Everyone is afraid to show their failures, their "bad side", and their weaknesses. They think that all anyone wants to see is them and their products working exactly how it's meant to work. When unfortunately this just isn't reality. Nothing works or looks 100 percent of the time exactly how it's supposed to. 

If more people were willing to show their failures that their products have had, or the are open to showing the zit on their forehead things would be different. Not only would they become more relateable, but they'd influence others to be more open about it. Creating a new environment on these social platforms and in every day life. Depression would go down, people would be happier, more confident in themselves. Because they would know whenever another acne spell hits them that their favorite influencer gets acne too, so it's normal, and it's okay.  So yes, images and impressions have a significant impact on the way people shop, act, and think.
