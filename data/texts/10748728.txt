                                             Cooperation or Competition;Opposing paths to success?

There are many success gurus out there that will tell you that you need to grind grind grind to pitch yourself above the competition. That this never ending work ethic is the path to success.

But is that really true? It seems there are many examples of burn-out among those who choose the "crush the competition" path. And that this mentality  leads to an atmosphere of cutthroat behavior. One example of this was the competition between the inventors Thomas Edison  and Nikola Tesla over the most efficient form of electricity.

One can only imagine what other technology would have been uncovered had these two not developed a rivalry in which they were no longer sharing information, and in the case of Edison purposely casting doubt on the brilliant ideas of Nikola Tesla. 
We will never truly know what a loss this was to our civilization that these two minds worked against each other instead of together.

One great organization that exemplifies how well cooperation can work and how powerful it can be is NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This military alliance of states formed in 1949 has gone on to shape our modern world even up to this day where it is currently as strong as ever in opposition to the Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

These historic examples that continue to affect us prove that cooperation has a much more powerful connection than competition.
