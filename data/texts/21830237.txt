Exactly its right. Modern society being criticixed for the current environment.In moden society people incomes are low but the cost of the products are high so poor peoples suffering lot.In this suitation,farmers are suffering because of the cost of the products using in their farming.In this modern society many industries to be more.More industries make the more pollution.As the pollutant dies more,make the farming lands,water and air firme.In this modern society peoples are forget the old civilization. Rich peoples are living happily in this society but poor peoples are affected by this society always.In this modern society crime happens a lot but punishments are decreasing.The punishments during the old civilization are more so the crime level is decreased.Basic materials like water etc are costly i this modern society.In this society individual independence are missing everyone trying to escape.The goverment also has come up with many rules including education.Education is most important part of our life but this society does not give this opportunity to everyone in this world because of education also expensive.Maximum government schools and colleages are changed to private.This suitation creates faithless on the Indian government.The foreigners are come to our nation and get more rights so they are independence to do crime.
