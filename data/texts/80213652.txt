Do people achieve more success by being cooperative or competive, is a long lasting question.  It depends on what your thought of being successful is in this world.  You can be successful and move up the corporate ladder or is it that you are doing what makes you happy.

I worked with a person who was every competitive. The rivalry was so intense I did not like going to work when I had to deal with her. She enjoyed being hostile to me and made sure that she told everyone that I never did my work.  If my coworkers stood up for me, she made my life more miserable by yelling and saying I did not know how to do anything.  She also enjoyed setting me up for failure, by not giving me instructions on what she needed done.  Her actions made me feel that I was a failure at my job, because I am not a competitive person.

I did feel successful at my job when I was working with the customers who enjoyed my interaction with them.  I made the customers happy because I showed them respect and kindness. I was able to get my job done and it showed in the customers comments not only to me but to my supervisors.  To me this was being sucessful in my world.

So, in conclusion you need to think about what success means to you.  This world is complex with may people who all have different thoughts, ethics, and action on how to be successful.  This means that success can only me measured by you and no one else.  I feel that people acheive more success if they are more cooperative than competitive.  Unfortunately, you need to find the right balance of the two in order for you to succeed.
