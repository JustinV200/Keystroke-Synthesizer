People are more likely to be happy when they focus first on their personal goals rather than the happiness of others because if they are not happy, they cannot truly make others happy.  When individuals are truly happy they will have the ability to focus on others.  If they begin by focusing outward toward others they will be distracted by their own personal needs

To begin, it's necessary to define happy in a personal context.  Is it personal relationships?  Accumulation of wealth?  Travel and adventure?  Professional achievements?  Without a context you will go in circles.  

It is possible to make others happy in small ways while working toward personal goals.  These two pursuits are not mutually exclusive, but rather a balance.  You never want to not be kind or civil in your interactions with others.  Do no harm!  Prioritizing personal goals may sometimes require you to say no to others but you can do so in a respectful way.  You may not have enough time to devote to larger causes at certain points in your life.

As you achieve personal happiness you can expand your focus to help humanity in a way that aligns with your values and interests.  Is there a group or topic that has grabbed your attention?  No matter how magnanimous we feel we can't help everyone.  Do you have a plan and the resources to help others?  How important is recognition of your work?  Critics may claim that you are only doing it for personal glory.  If you are not personally happy and grounded before working for the good of others you may not have the courage to face critics, or the ability to promote your vision to the larger community.

While it may seem selfish to put yourself first, it is necessary to build the character and fortitude necessary to help others.
