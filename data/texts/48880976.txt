Success is not a easy one for many, it acquires many hard work and dedication and a vision of that to do so. Some may have failures but it will motivate us to do more hard work than before. Failure is the stepping stone for the success, never ever seek an opportunity create your own opportunity that makes you succeed. Some achievements require team work and some may require single person conrubution, it depends  upon the goal we choose. 
First we can talk about Team work which require cooperation, which means if a team has number of players or executives or some other sort of people, everyone has to put effort to attain the victory, For example., in cricket all 11 has to play well to win the game, in projects every members has to work to get ready the project. These all things requires cooperation of each and every person who was required for it.
Second we say, single man work which is done by competition. Even though the goal was near one has to be full devoted until it is finished which says the person dedication towards the work. Also it requires the major thing which is competition, that motivates a person from inside to get the thing he wants. 
Being both competitive and cooperative makes a man perfect and tends him to learn the balancing nature of the achievement he has done. Being a significant worker and burying full effort, leads him to success. Both cooperative and competitive is important in one's life to attain great success, balancing them make us king or queen in our castle.
