It is my belief that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. People are too focused on first impressions or how someone looks rather than who that person is underneath their nice clothes and good looks. We become mesmerized by how someone looks or what a product looks like and keep those images imbedded in our minds and can't seem to let them go.

It's sad to know that we base how we feel about someone just by what they look like or what they are wearing that day before really getting to know someone first. We don't take the time or have the patience to look underneath all of that. I don't think we realize that. Our brains automatically focus on superficial appearances before we allow ourselves the opportunity to get to know someone. That is why it's so important to dress for success when going for a job interview or when you have a first meeting with someone. During a job interview, you only have a short time to really get across to someone your true self that can decide your future forever.

We shouldn't focus on first impressions based on appearance. We should focus on how kind someone is, how they treat others or what they are really like deep down on the inside. We are really missing out on great relationships if we are judging others or things based on appearance only. There really is something to the old saying "You can't judge a book by it's cover". That goes both ways. Something may appear nice on the outside but may not be so nice on the inside once you get to know it. You might buy a house that looks nice and fancy but once you really look beneath the walls, there could be all kinds of problems. 

It's important to keep an open mind because you just don't know how something or someone could change your life. Don't focus on what is on the outside. Keep an open mind and really get to know someone on the inside and you could be pleasantly surprised. There is a whole world out there underneath the surface left to explore.
