I think, in regards to the quesiton as to how likely a person is to be happy in accordance with certain behaviors, that those who focus on their own personal goals are like to be happiest. I believe this, firstly, because in many instances, a personal goal can end with the result of people(s) being happy as a result - for example acheving a goal to raise money for a charity can make all those who that charity helps happy. Secondly, acheiving one's goals gives a person a sense of satisfaction that cannot, and will not, always be dependent upon other people's reactions. One does not need to thier coworkers/family/friends to be happy in the case of an acheived goal, say the purchase of a new car - the satisfaction and happiness can be limited to oneself and still be satisfied. In contrast, if one solely depends upon the satisfaction that stems from seeing others happy, they are bound to be dissapointed - and often at that. One cannot always anticipate other's reactions correctly, and are bound, at timse, to be dissapointed when their actions do not warrent the reaction they were hoping for from others. Additionally, if one soley depends on others reactions for happiness, they learn not to depend on their own accheivements for their own happiness - something that makes accheving self-satifaction very difficult, and if a person is dependent upon others for feelings of acheivment/happiness they set themselves to be dependent upon others' whims and emotions - this is not a basis for a good mental/emotional health. One can almost always depend upon themselves, however.
