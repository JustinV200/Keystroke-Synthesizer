I feel that both the goal of helping others and helping onesself is essentially just still helping themselves. I also feel that if someone only focuses on one goal of helping just themselves or the other not helping anyone at all they can be equally as happy or less happy with each pursuit. You can get caught up in yourself and be unhappy that way or you were unhappy with what helping others cost you. 

When someone helps someone else they really are doing it to help themselves feel better and to help someone else. They get satisfaction from the positive feelings they get from helping other people which in turn is just helping themselves as well as helping the other people or person. The person really has to decide for themselves what is more important to them and what the cost of helping is and this can help determine how happy helping will make them and if they want to help. 

I think that you can gain happiness from helping and not helping. I think that you can really help yourself be happier by focusing on what you think makes you happy and implementing that choice for themselves. Either way I think you benefit whether you choose to help others or not. I feel that some people only help out of obligation and that still can make you happy and can cause unhappiness as well. Happiness from helping others really depends on the situation and how the person feels at the time and about what makes them the happiest.
