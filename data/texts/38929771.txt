Happiness comes in all different forms. I think people are more likely to be happy when they do something that makes them happy or others have gave them compliments or bought a special gift for them. Happiness is when you have a celebration of any kind it could be a birthday, promotion or a non celebration, form of happiness is a accomplishment on something you had finally completed and maybe was a difficut road to complete. 

I think people are happy, when they  got a  promotion at work because they worked hard . They are very honored to accept a promotion. It took them lots of work and helping others accomplish difficult tasks.  When people also was asked to work overtime and always stayed after hours to help others work alot of the time especially when a coworker goes on vacation or maternity leave. When people are  the first person to give their time. People are happy with their company and have no plans of leaving if they are happy. 

Happiness can also be when a partner is appreciated by their significant other. It feels great when one partner does something special and it wasnt expected. Just a small token of appreciation from ones partner wil bring happiness to your life. Happiness depends on  person and how they live there life. Im very happy all the time because Im appreciated both in my personal and career life. If someone is happy let them be. 

I think people are happy both focusing on themselves and helping others. Working to achieve career goals, maybe weight loss goals etc. Many people are happy when they donate their time to helping others as well doing a good deed.
