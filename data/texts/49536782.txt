The modern society must be criticized for being materialistic. Before 20th century, people were not interested on materials. They gave importance to the living beings around them and wanted to improve lives along with the growth of the people around them. It helped them a lot to lead a happy and respectful life in this society. They saved money for future generations, they saved it for the growth of their children and their grand children.

But in this modern world, people are spending most of their time for purchasing materials that show their wealth instead of purchasing things that fulfill their needs. They are wasting their money, time and everything to make others jealous about them. This will make the future genarations to become more materialistic than current generation people. This way the current generation is teaching the future generation to be more materialistic. They are ruining the world's future in this way.

And the modern soceity should be criticized ofr being materialistic. They are spending time for producing and consuming more stuffs rather than spending time for relationship development. Developing relationship will be helpful  more than purchasing materials and it will help the future generations too. So, the people should stop being materialistic.
