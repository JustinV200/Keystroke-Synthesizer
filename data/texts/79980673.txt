             First of all I would like to thanks you for giving me the oppurtunity to express my thoughts . Here I start my thoughts about the modern society is being reason for being people materialistic. Everybody that means each and every people in this world have love towards the things more than the people . In this modern society everything depends on the money you have and amount of things you have and how sophisticated you were in the society . people love to bond with the people who have everything to improve their life.They want themselves to be settled in this world.

             So for this the main reason was the modern society. This society sets the trademark that everything needs to be done in the perfect way. Everybody needs to live in the certain lifestyle. For that people needs money so they have to be more materialistic and they have to be done everything perfect so they can have money and they used that money to acheive everything. In that process people just forget to love eachother and they only focus on their so called work.


           And also modern society have the trend that people have to spend more money and live lavish lifestyle . This was reason people were materialistic. So more than the modern world people need to understand the fact that there is nothing is more than people's love and affection. They have to spend time with the family as well as friends. That is the real happiness . People needs to understand thuis. Thank you once again for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts.


Have a  great time in reading.
