Often times in society we make decisions and judgments based on appearances. These quick impressions can either be positive or negative depending on an initial gut reaction. Everyday we are attracted to appearances of dynamic packaging, entertainers, or strong political figures. These appearances don't always line up with someone's true character traits or line up with a product's true strengths. 

In the print and digital world advertisements are used to create and influence us. Packaging you would see in the grocery store always strives to give a product a favorable view. The product could be expensive, unreliable, or just manufactured poorly...but packaging can over emphasize to sell a product. How many times have you bought a package at a store based on cool branding? How many times have those products lived up with your expectations? Sometimes the branding of a product is used to promote and generate that positive spin on a product. It could be playing to your emotions based on how it makes you feel. Big bright colors. Bolded fonts. Promises. The problem is the product doesn't deliver.

Have you heard about the rich glamerous life of an entertainer? Sure you have. They are often shown standing in front their million dollar mansion with a huge grin, lamborgini, and designer clothes � but are they truly happy? The appearance is that lack nothing, and that money solves all their dillemas. Reality is, these stars often have broken families or a bad mental state.

Every election cycle the U.S. citizen is given multiple candidates to choose from to vote for. Candidates blurt out promise after promise on the campaign trail. Some argue that these promises are kept once a candidate is elected. Although sometimes this is true, candidates are statistically likely to fall through on promises to its voters.

Appearances aren't always reality. One can make assumptions every single day based on these initial images. People and products alike are painted by outward impressions. Next time you go into the store, or watch someone on TV...think about the effect they have on you without you really knowing much about them.
