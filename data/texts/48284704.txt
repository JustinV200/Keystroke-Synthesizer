Where does happiness come from?  Does it come from each of us internally or is it contageous and can be transferred from others to us. 

Happiness can come from within us, ingrained in us at an early age from happy parents and a happy stable home, later we find friendships with those whose families were similar in terms of how pleasurable, happy and content their families were.  However, even when not born into happy homes, I do think  by spending large amounts of time with individuals from happy homes, it is possible for contact happiness to be transferred from those individuals to others who are unhappy.  Sometimes people find that happiness is so satisfying that they become happy individuals even after an unhappy, unstable youth and remain that way for the entirety of their lives, because they see it is possible in the lives of those around them.  

The reason that we become happy adults (or whether we don't become happy) is largely dependent on our acceptance of giving up our unhappiness and making a decision to be happy.  Once we make that decision it is very easy to maintain the happy mind set and never return to our previous unhappy state by simply refusing to allow unhappiness to enter into their lives.

While there are some exceptions to the theory that happiness can be something that is personally achieved.  When it is not, psycological intervention may be requireded.  However, it has been shown that people can become happy for the remainder of their lives after receiving psycological care.
