I have learned in my almost 30 years of working in the work force that cooperation has the best results in the end.  Competition may get some one to work harder at a goal but cooperation generates more ideas and a better understanding in the end result.  Some people are motivated to try harder when there is competition involved but personally, I prefer to cooperate well with others and can be more creative in that aspect.  I believe men are more competitive than women and women prefer to have more cooperation when working or acheiving a goal.  

For me competition causes stress and I personally do not like that or need any more stress added to my life.  When you cooperate well with others it brings a meaninful and often peaceful feeling that is important for things to go well.  As we develop our skills competition is good if it is not the main focus and only if all involved has good results.  I can think back to when I was in high school and most of the students were always competing to see who was the best at whatever it was they were doing.
 
I never was the best at anything and it really did bother me as I felt I was being judged and left me feeling inadequate.  Cooperation will give you more power in the end and also make you the happiest.  I find competion to be less rewarding and not something I enjoy.  Although others may not agree with my thoughts I respect others decisions.  We are all entitled to our opinions so we should seek common ground to bring out the best in us.  Cooperation is really needed much more today than before.  With all the negative affects from the pandemic and people showing less interest in others, cooperation should be made a top priority.  In our schools or at work and even at home as we struggle to make sense of all that is happening in our world.  Someone who cooperates will be a blessing.
