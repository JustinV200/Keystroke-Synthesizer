Today, people are coming to materialistic world. It is not possible to get away from. Convenience atracts people. Why do people chose hard? Easy one is always preferred. I look at young people today They don't even want to work. Did we offer them everything to easily? 

As someone who grew up with difficulties, I try to understand them. It is not correct to accouse them of being materialistic. This is how we prepared the world for them. We always offered them the easy one. Why would they choose the hard one? We are now on an irreversible road. People will want more and more in the coming years. This will also cause sharing problems among people. 

Everyone will want to have better. We certainly can't blame people for that. It's human nature to always find better. Although some people are seen differently, it will be possible for us to see their wishes when their path opened. Different systems have tried around the world. Capitalism has always been the most adopted form government by people. This shows how important possesion is to people. It doesn't seem possible to stop people on this. Since it is not possible to stop people on this issue, we need some rules for them to act fairly. Unfortunately  the strong always wins.
