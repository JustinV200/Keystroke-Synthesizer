     Do you ever wonder if you can succeed more in life by cooperation or by competition? In my opinion, I will suggest that one can accomplish success by being a team player, working with others to achieve the same goals with input and knowledge from others to make everyone involved more informed and more likely to cooperate with each other to achieve higher goals.

     It has become human nature to take offense if someone offers unsolicitated advice or suggestions. We often feel others think they are more informed than us and we take on an air of resentment and dig our heels in more to "prove" we are the most knowledgeable and know everything of the task or project we are currently working. We feel that they are imposing and trying to make themselves look better and more awarding of the rewards of completing a task or project. We dig in our heels and become more stubborn, refusing to hear other aspects or suggestions.

     What if we worked the other way? What if we welcome input from friends or co-workers? They may offer insights we never thought of . . . that's not saying they are more informed or better but only that they may see a different side or way of doing things. Working together as a team with coordinating efforts would only strengthen the outcome of whatever you are working on resulting in a more informed or more creative end result.

     Competition is fine for contests, games, and athletics. Cooperation should be used in our everyday lives in working through family issues, crisis, work projects, school projects, etc. As the old saying goes, "Two heads are better than one."
