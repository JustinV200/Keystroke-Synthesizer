Materialism is a concept that has existed in human society for a very long period of time. As capitalism was introduced and as our living conditions improved, materialism has gained more popularity and has been a driving force for the progress we have been making as a species. Despite the benefits of materialism, being too materialistic can be and has been detrimental to many people as well. Thus, there is a need for society to be criticized for being materialistic. 

The biggest pitfall of materialism in the modern society is that it can worsen mental health issues throughout the society. The more materialistic people are, the more they tend to be easily unhappy by not being able to reach their materialistic goals and achieve their wants. One may argue that materialism can actually provide healthy motivation to work harder, which can be helpful for the development of the society. This can be true for some people, but for most, it will not be the case. Despite the popular notion in a capitalistic society that anyone is able to achieve anything they want, not everyone, if not most, will not be able to reach their materialistics goals. 

In an ideal world, materialism can be the source of a healthy society as there is a possibility that is can be managed to a healthy level. However, in the realistic modern society, the level of materialism cannot be controlled due to the natural tendency of human beings: to have greed. Therefore, being materialistic is something that should be criticized because it can and will be the source of mental health issues for so many people.
