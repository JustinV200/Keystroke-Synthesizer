There is no "I" in "TEAM", but there are several I's in individual success. For anyone who
has had a job where you need to rely on co-workers you know there are more than a few, that
do not pull their fair share of work, for team projects. Not so say my past employers hired
incompetent employee's, the team projects I have been apart of have always been successful,
but most of the time the over acheivers have always had to pull  up the slack. I unapologetically
argue, that one can acheive more success, by themselves, rather than a member cooperating
with a team.

Now, that you need to be a jack of all trades to do every job yourself.  However, you need
to develop the skill set to identify competent subordinates or sub contractors, to execute your
plan.  There will always need to be one person pulling the strings and guiding the ship. There only
needs to be 1 captain and many rowers. Try sailing a ship with many captains and one rower.
Indivdual success you need help from other people, but put a group of people together
who all want individual success will be a receipe for disaster.

I very well know the pyramid was built by thousands of people, same as the great wall of china,
but do any of those people truley feel they built the wall? Absolutely not. For most of us
we have simple goals, to increasde our salary, grow or start a small business, or acheieve
various career goals. All of these we should rely on ourselves to go after on our own. We will not be
let down by relying on others, and feel the utmost sense of accomplishment we we acheive. So,
please believe in yourself and aim for the stars.
