                  I don't think being mateialistic is a mistake cause everybody loves gadgets which make thier work easy. But being too much dependent on a materials would be a problem for this modern society. In this society everybody needs to make things faster for that cause we have to use machines , electronic gadgets etc,.
                  We are using to much technology for our simple needs, spending more money on unnecessary things which may lead to poverty and crisis. Everyone should know that even humans also work faster. Being dependent on humans is much more better than being dependent on a machine. We are creating artificial intellegence which thinks like us and take decision to its own, so we don't have to control it over and over to complete a simple or complicated task. But as it is a self thinking machine it may be a problem to human race, they may attack us in the future.   
                  finally I wanna say  that materialisim is good for development , but being too materialistic in this modern society can leads to destruction. So having a machine that is more controlled by human is way better than automatically controlled machines. We can only help us to develop in life and make our future bright and safe.
