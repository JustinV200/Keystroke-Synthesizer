I don't think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. It is true that people gather possessions but there are important benefits from this consumerism. Our entire economy is so interconnected and dependant upon consumer spending that it would affect our society as a whole if we moved away from it. Economic activity would hit wall street and main street alike if we did not have material spending. It would affect jobs in big towns and small towns as well as value of retirement accounts.

Furthermore, material possessions may be necessaryfor modern human life (e.g. clothes) and can be obtained cheaper through purchase than making them yourself. Not everyone has the meanas to obtain raw ingredients or have them on hand like a farmer so its not practical.

I also don't think that everything out there is necessarily a friviolous purchase that materialistic implies. Some possessions are needed to live in the modern age. We need food to eat, a vehicle to get to work, shoes on our feet. It's some possessions that aren't needed like knick-knacks, trinckets, memorabilia, fashion accessories, and things of that nature that give the purchases of materialism a bad name. There's a need to separate the needed from the optional.
