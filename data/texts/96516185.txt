Deciding if happiness comes by pursuing dreams and personal goals or if it comes by focusing on the happiness of others or on the improvement of humanity is very thought provoking.  People are very different in thoughts and feeling so the happiness of each individual would depend on the type of person they are.
I feel that people would be happier if they concentrated more on others and followed the golden rule of treating everyone the way they would like to be treated.  Being this kind of person would not allow time for anyone to feel guilt or hatred and would only make the world a better place in which to live.  It is so much easier to be kind and think ot others than to be self-centered and only caring about yourself and what you want or what you think will make you happy and being unconcerned about other people.
Many people strive to obtain material possessions and high social status and they do not care what they have to do to obtain it.  They think the material things in life can bring happiness. This causes them not to think about what they are doing to other people sometimes in order to get what they want.  
If people strive to treat others with kindness, consideration, and do everything within their power to make life a better place for all, they will be happy because happiness comes from within, knowing that you are living a purposeful life, a life that will go on after you are gone, a life that will be remembered by all because you made a difference to humanity.
Happiness should not be a person's goal in life.  The goal should be to work hard and do all you can to make yourself a better person and the world a better place and happiness will come.
