     The need, desire, and near-lust for "stuff" has pushed humans in industrialized countries to the brink of insanity. It has pushed people to do horrendous things, and brought thrilling ectasy.  To an outsider, it might seem strange to hold such acquisitions so high on a pedestal, but to our society it has become common place-accepted and a social norm. Yet at the same time, it does warrant a reflection of critical thinking, to look inward within ourselves and discover whether or not an item is really worth what it took for its acquisition. 
      How many people are living to work instead of working to live? It is a question that everyone should think about at some point in their lives. So much time is spent placing a value on those that work to achieve not a better society, but to achieve status and countless things that have pushed storage facilities into an almost necessity.  Society glorifies those with riches and scowls at the poor man on the street. This is demonstrated by the constant in-your-face commericialization of goods and services that work against self-esteem, and the value of being a human. 
    If there was more criticism of our obsessions with material goods, it might allow for that pause to question the worth and value of a person, not based on wealth or social status, but rather on the character of the person. It would allow people to see beyond that book's cover, and it would put an end to some, but not all assumptions.  Society has been so blinded and brainwashed into believing the idea that we need the "things" to survive, but as we are born with nothing, we will die with nothing. What is important is the legacy that we leave behind.
