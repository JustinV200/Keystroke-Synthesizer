     Yes, competition is everywhere whether you are a student or a professional. Now a days as much you crack the competition you chaces will increase to get more. When a new hire enter in an organisation, that time he only alone that he will have to work here as per the company timings and employee always think to give his best. Bit the same time employee found another employee at the same profile same position. Then first associate only think to do work more then second employee or his competitor. He forgot that he is here to show his effeciency, efforts to make work easy. But in cimpetiton some people get advantage to show his speed but the people who are actually  intelligent but not smart, they always lacking behind.
     Competition is good for everyone, every organisation. Because it shows that how much efficient we are and how we can do things better in a short time as well. In today,s life only a competitior can survive who is willing to do best at any cost.
     In offices, schools, society's only moderate people live smartly, because they know how they will be more successful or achieve their goals. A men who actually know the meaning of failure can be the best competitor.
