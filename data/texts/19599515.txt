Images and impressions have too much of an effect on many people. With so many companies using bright colors, attractive models and famous persons in their advertising it can be hard to tell the difference between something that is actually good, and something that is only advertised as being such. One example might be your favorite clothing store, do you truely find the clothing you purchase attractive, or did you like it because it looked good on the model? All too often we are fooled by what we see only to come out with low quality products. 

Not only is is companies that put off these false images of being good. In the media and even in politics we may look up to someone for all the wrong reasons. They may have flashy cars, own expensive clothing, they may even put off the impression that they donate to causes you like. This doesn't always equal up to them being a good person though, and can infact be quite the opposite. 

What about the news we consume? Those flashy headlines and biased opinions can lead to you believing fake news just because you find it attarctive or it fits into what you may lean toward in a political stance. These days it is hard to tell what exactly is true or false, what is good and what is bad, and what is important and what is not.

In our lives we have to consider these things, we have to think to ourselves, is this biased? Are they attempting to attract me into seeing something that isn't really there? Perhaps start by looking into reviews and other accounts, not simply the ones we wish to believe just because they fit into our own values or beliefs. A pretty face doesn't always equate to a good one, and you can't judge a book by it's cover.
