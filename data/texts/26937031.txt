I believe that one person's succes is independent of another's. I have pesonal experience that makes me believe this. I have three children that have all played a sport at some point in their lives. All three have different ideas of competition and different skills that help them achieve victories.

Mo oldest daughter, Kaytlyn, would be the biggest competitor of the three. In her mind, she needs to be better than everyone else to be the best competitor. She is a fair teammate, but still strives to be the best. There would be no cooperation from her in competition.

I'm going to jump to my youngest, my son, Kasey. He would be the epitime of cooperation when it comes to competetion. He is always looking to his teammates ans coaches to see what they need or want, before he thinks of just himself winning. He has tried many sports, but has not stuck with any. If he can not see the reason for competing then it means nothing to him. 

Now last, but certainly not least, is my middle child, Kameryn.  Not surprisiingly, she is a combonation of the two.  She loves the competetion, rather it be in race car driving, softball or volleyball. The one thing that holds her back, if anything, is concern for others involved. By her cooperating with other, she loses her sense of competition.

In conclusion, I believe that people would most likely achieve more success by competition. There is something that drives people during competition that helps them to succed. That being said, I do not think that people can't achieve success by cooperation, it is just less likely. It would all depend on the person.
