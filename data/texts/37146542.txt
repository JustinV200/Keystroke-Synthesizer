Competition versus cooperation. A steel bull versus a pushover. No matter how you look at life, the world will always throw things at you that you are not expecting or that you can not control. How you choose to see and handle these situations is what makes every person differnt. 

I feel as though people learn more life lession from competition. People learn more about themselves, what they are capable of and how to navigate through other situations through competion. Now don't get me wrong, competition does not mean being rude, abusive or  disreguarding to others. Competition means holding yourself accountable and thinking outside of the box. While I feel like cooperation is falling in line and sometimes submitting when you are acutally capable of so much more. 

Being invovled in group sports as child up untill my teenage years I feel as though competion is something that I learned. Unconsiously, little did I know that would become apart of my life and affect me as an adult. I always see the possibilies that there is for me and I know that with hard work and dedication I can achieve or at least get close to those goals. Knowing that I am not the only one with those same goals in mind and that others are striving for the same thing that I want makes me work and focus harder, which in return benefits me. Should I not be able to achive the level that I was aiming for, that allows me to evaluate what I could have done better which helps me and motivates me for the future. 

For me as a minority, especially in the work enviroment, cooperation means being pushed to the back or not heard. I have learned that if I want to be seen or heard I need to be bold, which more times than not, means competing with those around me.

Not everyone in this world is given the same oportunites. Some people don't have a choice when it comes to competion or cooperation. This world is, and always has been, a dog eat dog world and that isn't changing anytime soon.
