Success is vital in anything that you put forth effort in. Everyone wants to be successful, but what is it that drives us? Many people would argue that cooperation keeps them on the right track to success. Others would suggest that competition of drives them to reach their goals. I personally beleive that both cooperatioin and competition play very important roles in an individuals success.

Cooperation when reaching goals a key element to success becuase it keeps you pointed in the right direction. In order to truely be cooperative, an individual needs to be open minded and understanding of what it takes to get to the next step on the journey to success and put forth the effort that it takes to get there. I beleive competition plays a tremindous role in what can drive an individual because in todays world, who doesn't want to be on top? From small businesses, to large corporations, everyone is competing to be the best.

Cooperation and competition play important roles in ones achievements. Both are needed for high success. Yes, cooperation will likely get you far and keep you on the right path, but competition will drive you to stay on top of your game so that you dont loose your place.
