Success can be achieved in many ways, each person has their own way of doing things and geting the task done.Cooperation and competition are the most common ways a person can attain success

Competition is a main way of getting motivated and get to success,when a rivalry is started it will bring more willingness to work and get the task done,people always drive to be at top of the podium so having a competition to get a work done will certainely achieve  results,however it may get more heated when competition motive gets over a line

Cooperation will be needed when a team need to get success,No team can achieve victory without cooperation of team members, A work can be done easily when more number of people starts to do the work, even when a person is behind a task another person can help them handle it, The taste of victory when a group of people do it is much happier then getting to success all alone

My opinion will be either it may be competition or cooperation attaining the success is most important part, each and every person should drive themself towards success and do the needed hardwork to attain it,In a world were success is all matters we must do what it takes to get it
