     The happiness of others and the good of the world are powerful motivators for most people. We want to see our children grow up in a better world than we did, and we work towards that goal. Regardless of political persuasion or personal beliefs this is a common thread throughout humanity and throughout history. 
    
    I believe that a balance of personal goals and goals that benefit others is the ideal combination for living a life that feels fulfulling and meaningful. It's important that we feel good about ourselves before we can be useful to others. So working towards a personal goal, with the ultimate objective of making the world a better place will give your life a purpose for yourself and for others. 
     
     Even if you don't have children, you can think of the good of others. Family, friends or just the world at large. All except the most nihilistic can find a person or group that deserves their help and attention. 
   
    Some may say that only goals that benefit you personally are useful. These people are naive. We only exist due to the community-mindedness of our ancestors, and humanity will only survive if we continue to act this way. 
     
   For the good of yourself, for the good of ourselves, for the good of the world, we must continue to work toward a better future.
