One issue that we face in today's society: Materialism. What exactly is materialism you may be wondering. Materialism has to do with placing value on material items that we purchase. Some find happiness in materialistic things; whereas, others don't consider placing such a high value on such things. So the question being: Should society be criticized for being materialistic?

Personally, I feel that what it comes down to is that each individual person should do whatever it is that makes them feel joy and that they shouldnt be judged for doing so. What one person chooses to find joy in should have no influence on how another person views them. Finding joy in materialistic things has nothing to do with the character of that person. Just because they enjoy physical items, doesnt mean that they don't have feelings for others or that they don't enjoy experiences as well. Let's say for example that someone just lost their pet. As part of their grieving process, they went out and purchased a necklace that has their pets name engraved in it and they value this necklace very much. Does that make them materialistic? I think not. However, lets turn the tables and take sentimental value out of the picture. Someone goes out shopping one day and purchases a necklace that they thought was cute and brings them joy. Your initial thought is probably, oh that person is so materialistic that they find joy in such a thing. I can see where you're coming from. However, what one chooses to do with their money should be their own business and they should never be judged in doing so. 

In conclusion, modern society doesn't have the right to judge someone for being materialistic. At the end of the day, it is their life and their money and what they choose to do with it shouldn't concern you. They are still a human being with feelings and just because they find joy in materialistic possessions, it doesn't make them any less of a person.
