Our society is materialistic and while often criticized and said in a derogatory manner, no one exists with nothing.  From the unhoused person with their possessions in a shopping cart to the incredibly wealthy person with multiple homes to the self-proclaimed 'off the grid & simplistic' person, we all need things to exist.  

Possessions vary but we all need clothes, some way to escape the elements, and food.  Once those basic needs are met, most often pursue other material goods.  Now the pursuit varies with some people being criticized as being wasteful  (and rightly so) while some pride themselves on being prudent.   Yet even, prudent has vastly different definitions.  It may be the person who lives in the tiny house yet has three 'outbuildings' for thier stuff.  It may be your neighbor who only shops at thrift stores.  It could be the person who only finds 'free' things of places like Facebook Marketplac.  But regardless, they are consumers.  

But I challenge, we need all kinds of people.  Just as we need diversity in all aspects of our life, our society needs all types of materialistic people to function, from the minimalist to the extravagent (and knowingextravagent varies depending on your point of view).   We need people who are willing to share their wealth, we need people spending money to keep our economy functioning.  Is it perfect, no.  Do we have uneccesarily large and embarrassing income gaps in this country, yes.  And do material good brings happiness, no.  But they do meet basic needs and more and there is no eliminating them.   You can criticize materialism but it is a part of our nation, of our world, and it drives our economies.  I challenge we could all be more mindful but we won't eliminate our need or desire for 'things'.  And while yes, companies like Amazon make it too easy, seriously who can pass up a a 'good deal'.
