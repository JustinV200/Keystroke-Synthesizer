Materialismis a form of psycological behavior in humans which makes the humans focussing more effection and love towards materialistic things than natural carvings, human emotions and relationships.
Materialism in a way leads to minute happiness rather than any emotional connect which effects a persons mental health and never be happy with the thing attitude.It brings in more possesivenes for things and the money needed for buyinmg them rather than the warmth , support required for a better mental strength.
In daily life we come across many people who at a previous point of time say 10 to 15 years back used to interact with a hi, bye connect, spend leisure time talking with friends and family.Now a days their only focus and only motive is to earn money buy things,more things , show it to off others and feel the happiness that they pocess something exlusive which no person have.
Materialism is ok up to a limit as man is a social creture and the want for basic need and luxury in this ever connected world.Going above the limit of having every new thing which is of not use for our daily need is a physological behaviour which may harm us mentally and socially.Personally i feel being interactive with humans around and spending time in nature with less consumtion from materialistic things can be a path to peaceful life.
At the end of the day one should be physically and mentally fit to enjoy even the materialism.therefore one needs to be taught from an early age what are the things that are really necessary for being a better person in  life.
