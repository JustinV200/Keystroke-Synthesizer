                  In reality images and impressions made negative impacts on people.nobody is willing to see the quality or content of the product.the advertising companies are concentrating only on how to reach their product on market,for this they call celebrities or politicians or famous people to promote their product.
                 we people also not analysing the product incredients adding on the product,just like that after seeing our favourite celebrities or influencers posting or coming in ads to promote the product we blindly believing it and buying it.we are not ready to check whether that product is suits us or not. seeing the celebrities and getting the product is not a good manner we should analyse it .
                  Now a days ad companies is not giving the quality content they just promote their product by celebrities and not giving the quality product to the consumers.they should have resposiblity  to our health or whatever.they should focus on only how to give the best to the customers,they should create organics one insteed adding chemicals.
                  When they focus on their product quality and not give much important to the celebrities or politicians,that day only they gain the loyal customers.we customers also should be aware of the product which coming to the market.celebrities are also normal people like us so dont believe their words dont treat them like god. you should try it and get it.never get anything by seeing colors are attractive ones.get things by which suits you well and good.
