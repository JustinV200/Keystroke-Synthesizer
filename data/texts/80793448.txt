People seem to achieve more success through cooperation. A team wins when all players cooperate together to achieve teamwork. A positive attitude also goes along with cooperation. Positive attitudes bring good karma back to you. You can achieve great things with a positive attitude. The feeling of accomplishing a goal through cooperating with a team is a great feeling.

People can also achieve success through competition. But in a competition, there is only one winner. People may be fueled by greed and success more than the reason for the competition. The feeling of victory is glorious for the competitor. Competition is a big part of our daily lives, in work and pleasure. Atheletes are known to be competitive and successful. Many people grow up watching sports and idolizing atheletes.

Some people are not competitive at all though, but are still successful. I am not a competitive person, but have still been fairly successful in life with accomplishing my goals. I have a friend that is ratther competitive, and she is not as successful in life as you would believe her to be.

In conclusion, I think you have to have both factors to succeed in accomplishing goals. In a sense, competition requires cooperation from both parties, and cooperation does not require competition. So in theory, cooperation is more important than competition.
