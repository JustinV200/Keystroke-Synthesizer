   The essay is about the people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition,  In general cooperation means people work together to achieve a common goal on other hand competition means that the people concentrate to maximise self benefit and realisation of self interest.
    Some people promote cooperation because they like to be more friendly and they read to accept the idea from others. Cooperation required more coordination and at the final we get group rewards not individual one. 
     Some people promote competition as the only way to achieve success because they want show their power and they are the person to avoid the conflict and disharmony.
      According to me Cooperation is better than competition because In competition we need individual effort and the result may be negative and it leads to harm or damage.and also there is a limitation to do work and at last  we may get dissatisfaction  and anxiety.
       But in cooperation people put join effort to get success and positive result and also there is no limitations to do work at last we get satisfaction and contentment.
       So, I concluded that,  In a complex world  coorperation is more important than the competitions to achieve success. and also coorperation help us to achieve success easily than the competition.
