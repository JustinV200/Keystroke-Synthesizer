Modern society has become far too consumed with acquiring material posessions and has lost sight of the value that comes from shared experiences with others or even just by ourselves in nature. That is where I find true joy.

When I review my life and look for joy, it is found in the memories of my experiences. In fact, it is often found in unexpected places. In retrospect, the surprises along the way, events that did not go as planned and even things that seemed quite negative in the moment turn out to be some of my fondest memories. Reflecting on these memories alone with my own thoughts or recounting them as stories told to others brings far more joy than simply looking at souvenirs sitting on a shelf.

Sure, I collect things that provide ease and comfort as much as the next guy. But investing my time and energy exploring and observing the world around me is far more gratifying than simply buying more stuff. I have everything I need to be safe and secure in life. What I need for fulfillment is interest in the world around me and what I can do to at least appreciate it if not help to make it better. When it comes to material posessions, less is more.
