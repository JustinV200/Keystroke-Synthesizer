From an early age, we are taught how to interact with others while we are also learning how to self-identify who we are as individuals. We are taught to share and get along with others while, at the same time, we are learning new communication and life skills. 
Often times, we find ourselves influenced by the morals and values our elders. If these morals and values are skewed towards self-grandizement and personal success instead of focusing on the improvement and benefit of the society as a whole then, an individual is more likely to be more driven to compete rather than cooperate with others in their day-to-day lives. This mentality of focusing on comparing one's achievements to those of their peers affects the individual's relationships and mental health. It is a reasonable assumption that an individual is more likely to experience stress, anxiety, depression and a fear of failure when they become too focused on competing with others; less happiness and satisfaction with their achievements.
 Individuals that are more focused on cooperative efforts are likely to form stronger relationships, have less stress and anxiety while working with others and more oriented towards focusing on the "whole picture". This makes it possible for them to be more open to experiencing new things and enjoying the experiences because they don't worry about failure or the judgement of others. If one takes into consideration all the areas of an individual's life that may be viewed and measured in terms of success, it is reasonable to assume that a life lived with a focus on cooperation would be the more fulfilling one. Cooperation leads to stronger relationships both at work and in the personal life. It leads to greater achievements that benefit society as a whole. Cooperation means many work towards a goal instead on the burden being on a sole individual. This means less stress on the individual to compete and more freedom to enjoy and engage with others.
