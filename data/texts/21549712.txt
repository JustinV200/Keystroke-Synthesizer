It is said that you only get one chance to make a good first impression and for many people the most powerful and instantanteous impression is visual. A "blink" impression of someone or something provides a powerful reference point for future interactions, and one that is often stubbornly fixed. 

Moving past the visual first impression is difficult for several reasons. First, it requires effort. It is just easier to make up your mind on something and ignore additional datapoints that may contracdict your existing thoughts. Second, it is uncomfortable. Re-examing a first impression requires a certain admission that you may have made a mistake initially, or may reveal some undesireable personal bias(es) as your first impression is proved incorrect. And lastly, it requires an intellectual curiosity and ability. It is easy, even for a child, to look at something and form an opinion. It requires a skill and certain level of brainpower to evaluate a person or issue for its inate merits, to dig deeper than surface-level and develop an informed and education position. 

Thirty second news clips and just about all consumer-focused print, video and digital advertising are massive, market-driven proofs that image is indeed everything and maybe the only thing. If abilities are what truly matter, then show me the money. You won't be able to.
