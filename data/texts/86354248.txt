Do people acheive more success by cooperation or by competition?
            Actualle the above question can be answered in different context. Because success can not be completed in a single context , it may be 'success in Business', 'success in public life' or 'success in personal life',etc.... So in the context of Success in Business, people can acheive more by cooperation and not by competion. While in Business  the success is based on the profit how much we earned other than other competitors. 
          Only if we concentrate in the quality of production, development and marketing the marginn of the company will increase. To increase the margin of the company cooperation with the emloyees is very important. If we think just to defeat other company in a competetive mode we can not acheive the success. Only team work will move on to a success.
         In the context of personal life, merely cooperation will make you success. With compromises made along with your romantic partner, making smooth relationship with your loving partner by small adjustments like sharing work in home, driving your partner to her office . Only cooperation with our family members we can success in personal life. And only cooperation with our partner we can successfully bring up our children. And the children will acheive more. 
      And in the context of public work, like a work involves environmental issue. for example If there is a firm near your residential area causing pollution to the water source vicinity to you area, Only with cooperation of your neighbors you can acheive anything, by signing a petition against that factory.
   Finally people acheive success by cooperation., Not  competition with others.
