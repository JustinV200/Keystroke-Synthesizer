Materialism captivates modern society regardless if you're in the lucky p0pulation that is able to afford items that don't add value to your life or not. It is fact that acquiring materialism drive meaning and happines in our lives, however, is these feelings short-lived or do we cherish the item(s) that we acquired long-term?
Personally, when I buy item(s) that I don't need in my life, I find that here's a short-term satisfaction when acquiring it but the feeling doesn't last long-term. If it is home decor, the item(s) acquired will be acknowledge and viewed and eventually I will grow tired of it and re-sell it or donate it. The same goes for clothing and shoes. I wear about 50% of what is in my closet and the 0ther 50% sits there until an occasion calls for it. The gratification is short-term.
Others may say that they do cherish the items that they acquire. In this case, I do agree that there are items that are acquired that will provide an individual with meaning and happiness. For example, if an invidual loves to paint, then they may acquire easels, canvas, oils, brushes, and lastly, expensive frame to disply their art. 
Whether there is a short-term gratifiation or cherishing that artwork that you worked so hard on, acquiring things may cost long-term dissatisfaction or long-term satisfaction.
