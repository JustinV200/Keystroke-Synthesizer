One can think of many reasons to be critical of our modern society, is being too materialistic one of them ? Let's examine that question and see what we can come up with. 
When we think of what appears to make a large number of people happy today, acquiring possessions and making money  seem to be two endeavors that are prevalent in our society. However, is this a reason to be critical of our modern culture ?
One does not have to look very hard to see the evidence of the importance that many folks place on being "successful" and having a lot of material things in their life to make them "happy." Watch any TV channel for a few minutes and it will not be long before commercials and ads featuring flashy sports cars, designer clothes and high end jewelry will splash across the screen. 
The actors in these commercials appear happy and to be enjoying life to the fullest and it can have the effect of making the viewer feel "Gee if I only had a car like that, I would be happy too !" 
Some may argue that material possessions really can make people happy and having a large bank account is not a reason to feel blue. Others may say that material things only bring temporary happiness.
It is really up to each person what does or does not make them happy.Therefore, I see no reason to be critical of our society in this regard.
