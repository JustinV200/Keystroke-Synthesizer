Hi Everyone, I'm an Amazon MTurk (ID #-C6KH), and thanks for reading this essay. I definitely not claim to be an expert on the topic and I'm not even care/dare to draw a final conclusion on it.  Just want to stimulate your thinking (let the juice flow so to speak) and hopefully contribute to your success in arriving to your own conclusion on the matter.   

Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?

Wow - what a grand, philosophical question we have here!

My short answer is (as you've guessed it) - It depends.

It depends on the definition/measurement and the criteria of SUCCESS.  It depends on the desired outcome we seek out of setting such standard of Success. 

For example, if success is defined as beating the world's fastest record to run a mile (for either gender) - because this is a personal goal which must be accomplished on an individual level - competition will bring out the best of each runner who participates. 

Another example, if success is defined as being one of the Fortune 100 companies controlling 70%+ of its related market shares - you'd see one's Success must be built upon the failures of many others (e.g. Amazon, the one-stop shopping hub on the Internet has killed off many retailers of local communities). 

As you apply the same thinking over many other scenarios, you'd discover that cooperation and competition are just aspects/action taken by individual/group/race/companies/nations in the pursuit of "success", whether if it's as grand as War or Peace on international level, or to be the BEST whatever on an individual level - cooperation and competition are to be found in the pursuit of success. 

I hope this article helps you to think more about the issues and helps you in your pursuit of your successes in your life.  Thanks!
