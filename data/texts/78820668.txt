   I strongly believe that true happiness can only be attained by how positive your life time has a direct effect on people and humanity. The services you willingly give to the course of making the world a better place to live for yourself and others gives you certain satisfaction and joy knowing fully well that you have devoted your life to helping people get over the barriers and challenges of life.

    Going back to 2020 when the world was put on its toes by the deadly corona virus, we all realized that the neede  each other to survive, the aids and assistance that came to the helpless situation did so much to teach humanity and selfless service which brought about pure happiness to peolple who understood that happiness an truely be attained when you make others happy. Happiness can also come in form of showing love to others, such as partner or your children, the love you show to them brings out a natural happiness in you and makes want to go to the extra lenght of sacrificing a part of you life for them, and knowing fully well that whatever pain it might cost you will still make you naturally happy you made those choices.

       Sometimes happiness can be attained by possession, the mind set becomes accomplished when you atttain some certain heights or set goals, the possession of wealth can also translate into one being happy and fulfilled. when we finally reach a clearity of n achieved goal, the whole mind becomes more brighter snd vivid that one starts pay more attention to themselves, at this moment of peak experience, we could pause and access the situation we are in and conclude to accept the stage we are in as a point to be happy or not.  In conclusion, happiness is relative and can only be fully translated by oneself.
