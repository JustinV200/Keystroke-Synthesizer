While success is achievable through competition or cooperation, the latter has proven much more likely to produce results that stand the test of time.  In a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected, it is more important than ever to encourage methods of interaction that allow opportunities for understanding, as well as accomplishment.

Competition, which may be the more common route at the moment, also has a tendency of creating friction between people.  Especially in environments outside of sports, such as business, this friction can compound over time, causing significant damage to important relationships and, subsequently, whatever endeavor those relationships support.  With competition, there is little room to recover from failure.

On the other hand, cooperation fosters a sense of team or family.  Drawing from this, people are encouraged to assist each other to achieve a common goal, as opposed to success being restricted to a single person or group.  This calls to mind the saying "a rising tide lifts all boats"; the success of people who choose to cooperate becomes everyone's success.  With cooperation, failures can more easily be recovered from, as members of your operation will be there to assist with any problems.

Success is something that everyone wants to experience in their lives, but how they go about doing it can drastically alter the extent to which they do so.  With competition having a high possibility of causing friction, and cooperation more likely to develop strong bonds, it is clear which route should be taken when given the option.  Working together, with the idea of supporting everyone involved, creates real success.
