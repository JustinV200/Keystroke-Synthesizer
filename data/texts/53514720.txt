It's interesting how society has evolved from having too little to now seemingly having too much. I think the criticism of materialism is valid...but then you must stop to ask the question, too much of what?

The case against materialism started with the idea of convenience and secondly, trying to impress others with dumb ideas like social status. Social status began to take the place of actual accomplishments, like being smart or running a business or raising a family. 

The advertising industry has done a magnificient job of shifting our focus away from what we accomplish to what we buy, in fact turning material goods into a pseudo accomplishment.  Owning stuff that makes your life livable, like a house or car or clothes, is not materialistic in that sense. But when you're buying stuff you don't need just to show off to someone, I think that's an excellent foundation for the argument that society has become too materialistic.

All these things we buy trying to impress someone else (and really, are they?) too often lead to accumulating debt which makes most people miserable. We're also adding to the endless landfills and environmental degradation of manufacturing stuff, of throwing away stuff which by now we should understand there really is no way to throw away anything once we bring into existence. 

It seems society has evolved to the point now that what we have too little of is not stuff but being responsible consumers, concerned more for the welfare our own finances and our own accomplishments than some imaginary approval from strangers.
