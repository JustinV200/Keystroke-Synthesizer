                                    Competition and cooperation are two ends of a rope. They keep a distance between them. Competition means the success of a person and others are always fail in this term. But cooperation is different it is a joined nature of peoples and exchange thier ideologies. Cooperation and competition they have good and bad feature. These two are very common in our current society and we see this in our daily life.

                                   In the term competition means that a single person victory and others are destroy. Competition make a new world of ego and complex. It create cruel thing between peoples. Peoples only think thier own success in the competition world and they gone for any extreme to achieve thier success. People do anything for thier own victory if the thing is very bad they do not care about that. If someone hurt by thier behavior they don't bothered about that. Competition world like this.

                                  In cooperation we make a joined society and a respectful society. Cooperation means that share ideas and thought between a group of peoples. It helps to choose a good idea and thought. Clarify our doubt to discuss with others and they help to us. We can share our feelings with other and they will give us to intructions to overcome our problems. We have a huge number of choice in cooperate withothers and choose the right and suitable one.

                                 Competition and cooperations we need both as per the situation. I think cooperation is more better than competition because we need a joined nature to overcome the current society problems. Competition makes a society with full off ego and complex but cooperation makes joined society and peoples always together in cooperation world. In my personal opinion I stongly believe that cooperations is better to us.
