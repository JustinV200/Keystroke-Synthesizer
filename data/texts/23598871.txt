The human race has survived by both competition and cooperation. The question as to which of these important culutral factors is the most influential in our history is questionable. Does competition, rivalry and power drive people to success? Or is cooperation, working together to form a unique outcome, the way we have survived and thrived in our world? I believe both play a part, however, a focus on cooperation and teamwork will succeed in any task. 
In my work as a mental health therapist, I see partnership and support as an essential component to thriving in life. I believe that all people need support and a focus on competition can lead to conflict and struggle. This strife may lead to a negative sense of self, dysfunctional relationships and poor emotional regulation. I recognize that some would say that a healthy dose of competition is necessary in some enviornments, and I would agree in the most specific of circumstances. Motivation for success and achieving mastery in something may be accomplished by that sense of competition. While I agree that this could be perceived as healthy, I would caution that an overwhelming sense of competition in every aspect of life may be detrimental to a person's ability to genuinely connect with others.
In conclusion, recognizing that both cooperation and competition have its own respective power, I firmly believe that a sense of togetherness, feeling connected and engaged with others in cooperation, will achieve a higher rate of success to important challenges in life. In examining our history, specifically in the United States, there is a theme of individualism that I feel can be challenging for most. Having a sense of cooperation, feeling like you have a team of support around you, can make all the difference in the level of confidence that is needed to succeed in a task.
