       Do people always success by cooperation only not by competition because in cooperation we can do anything by a team of people .In team means we can share the knowledge and make decision.In competition means knowledge will not spread it limited with someone only .so thats why coopration is the best.
        when people doing work are any event in cooperation means there in no lack of mistakes and we can manage the time and do every thing in the cooperstive manner .if its in competition means only single will take all the responce it may have lot of chances to have miscomunication  and lot od confusions .thats why cooperation is allways best  in cooperation we can always have the discussion about the topic and we can find a best way to finish the work .
     if it was competition means people don't  share a  knowledge with others they will do it by there self only that may cause some confussion and  mistakes. so cooperation is always best.In cooperation we can make a group of people with different knowledge so we find a different way to solve the problems in different manner  so as my knowledge cooperation is best way to achieve more success .
