The concept of happiness changes througout a persons life, events and people have a direct influence in how a person defines happiness. For some, happiness is a state of mind and is not related to any event or particular person.
True happiness should be related to how you make people feel and your influence in their life, when you help someone achieve their goals, or just help them reach their full potencial, you would feel a sense of satisfactin and achievement yourself.
There have been many studies related to happiness and how to achieve happiness, some scholars believe that by focusing on specific goals, people can get more satisfaction in life and therefore be happier, they say that if a person works towards small specific goals, they are more likely to achieve them and avoid frustation. Other scholars believe that if your help others achieve their goals, you would feel as a part of something bigger and therefor have a better and more satisfactory sense of achievement, these scholars believe that group acomplishments are more important than individual ones.
These happines theories are both valid and make sense, but are based in the opinion of those who make them, although they have merit, they are somewhat subjected to how a person was raised and the environment they live in. A person struggeling to eat would find that it's more important to survive than to help his friend to get food, but if a person has the means to have a comfortable life, he would try to help others to feel as a part of the comunity.
In the end, happiness is a concept that depends on many factors, it is really hard to determine what makes people happy, for some could be the achievement of personal goals and for others could mean helping those who are less fortunate. Happiness could be achieved just by doing the things that make people feel better, its a person choice that depends on how a person was raised, how his economic situation is, how religious he is and how involved in the community he is or wants to be.
