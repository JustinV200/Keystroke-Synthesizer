Materialism is viewed negatively in society, and rightly so, in my opinion. In my experience, the greatest true happiness came from sources other than material possessions. Who is truly happier, the wealthy man with fair-weather friends and a trophy wife, or the poor man with a close loving family? I feel sorry for people that have experienced their greatest joys from material possessions, because they have not seen the best the world has to offer.

The happiest moments in my life had nothing to do with possessions. The day I got married. When my son was born. Every time I see him smile with pure joy. Other people, and your relationships with them, are the only real source of happiness. Everything material is fleeting, but the people in your life will be in your memories as long as you live. It's the only way you live on in the memories of others in a meaningful way, if you are a good person and have a positive impact on them.

I would like to ask people that argue that materialism brings true happiness, "Would you give up your child, your wife, or your best friend for your car? Your house? If so, how important are YOU in their eyes? Would they have your back if you ever lost your wealth and needed help? What will people say about you when you pass? Will you be missed, or will it just be a mad dash to divide up your stuff? I think that most of the problems in our society nowadays are a direct result of people being too materialistic, and holding their wallet in higher regard than ethics, the well-being of others, etc.

In conclusion, if you want to find true happiness, find it in the relationships you have with others. You might enjoy that nice car, but it won't make you complete.
