I believe that people are happier if they focus on their own personal goals.  It really is important to set goals for your self and reach small milestones one at a time to get to those big breaking points. There are many times in life that you can help others and make them happy, but I think to be truly be happy you have to take care of yourself by meeting your own personal goals and needs. 

For instance, when you graduate and head to college, it's important to have a tenative game plan. While those plans can be tweaked, and life happens along the way, it's important to stick to the path that you originally choose. I believe that the first path that you choose is what your heart truly desires. If you furthered yourself by completing the degree that you set out to get, then you are more than likely to land your dream job.  

There are many ways to stay motivated. I think a lot of that comes from mental clarity and health. While taking time each day to take care of your self and having a deep self awareness, it gives you insight to the progress you are making. Some goals may be large, and some may be small, but overall, I think it's so important to inch closer and closer each day. 

I may not ever reach true happiness, but I can tell you I'm a lot happier whenever I know that I'm accomplishing the things in life that I have set out to do. If you are constantly trying to please other people, then you are not able to be completely fulfilled. There is a longing to accomplish what YOU want to do.  

While trying to fulfill happiness in others, is sometimes rewarding, it can be costly.  Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you still can't please the other person.  On the other hand, when a person is happy and is thriving, it can bless you and make you work harder. But I do believe that true happiness comes from within. It is very pleasing to see the fruitful works of your own labor.
