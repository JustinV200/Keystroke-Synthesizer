        I believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. There are alot of false advertisements where things that they show on social media and on television show an image to entice people to buy the product, but the details and how it can improve a consumer's life is never emphasized. An example would be advertising a hair gel and it may show a nice picture of someone's hair done very nicely, but the benefits of using the gel is never fully mentioned to boost consumer self esteem when using the product.
          In most grocery stores, they advertise alot of meals and the appearance of the boxed or bagged packaging seems very realistic and tasty, but it is another story once the consumer cooks the meal and it does not taste good. In most cases contents of the meal looks different from the box or bag that was shown, and it makes the consumer distrustful of the company advertising it (like false advertisment), and they most likely will not purchase anymore products from the company again. 
         With social media certain entertainers, politicians, and other public figures have a way of winning over society with their appearance, but many of them did not achieve significant success or had impacts on people that contribute to helping them or people who live in underpriviledged places in society. America has a way of putting them on a high pedestal because of their image, but they are not really role models setting an example of helping mankind.
