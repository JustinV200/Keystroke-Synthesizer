Success comes in many forms and is achieved in many ways. The way this is most often produced is through the power of cooperation. People working together can inspire postive outcomes, drive for victory as well as competition. 

Cooperation between people can lead to a higher level of sucess. This can create drive to suceed. When cooperating with others, people tend to put in extra effort, pay attention to details on a more consistent basis and create an ambition to acheive the goal of either the group or individual. There is a desire to not let your team or group down which helps prevent failure. Wanting to be a good and productive member of the team can also lead to collaborative ideas as well as increase productivity time when working together as opposed to individually.

While competition is often perceived as the best way to achieve success, it can sometimes lead to failure due to lack of asking for help when needed.  When a person is solely based on their own actions or thoughts, this can hinder the creative ideas that typically comes from collaboration. Competition can also become a breeding ground for negative views of people that whom the individual is competing. Positivity is more related to success which means cooperation is more likely in the production of achieving accomplishments that are longer lasting.

In conclusion, while competition can be a good way to achieve success, cooperation has a much better effect on the rate of success. Cooperating with a team doesn't just lead to success, it can lead to long lasting friendships. These friendships that are developed can help with success long term as well as building a mentally healthy support group.
