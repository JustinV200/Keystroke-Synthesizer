Because of advertisemnet people buy product. Multi-national companies spend billions of dollors on advertisement. They hire highly paid actors for the advertisement of their product so that it attract customers. The actor who never used that product promote it and people buy it because of his face.
Most of the online product that we buy never comes upto mark that they look in the images on the websites. People must check reviews of the people who already bought the product before buying them. Here comes another game, reviews are also paid, like fake instagram and youtube followers.
People who go to the walmart or any other big stores. Often their trolley is full of the the stuff they needed less. They come to the store for buy something.
