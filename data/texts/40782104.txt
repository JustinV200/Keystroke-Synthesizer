There was a time that we would not be proud of being infuenced by appearances, however there has been a drastic change in the attitude that we are taking in regards to how appearances influence us today.  Appearances are fake in essence, but it seems to be all that anyone even notices or cares about.  When this happens too much, it can programs us to put irrelevant things in higher regards than they actually should be.  This places in our phyche things of less importance more often that it should. 


 I often reflect on the fasad going on in the daily lives of people today due to what we see and hear.  All it takes if for someone to come up with a look or packaging to possibly go go viral, and influence many individuals and their actions.  Just take a look around at how many things influence us daily. 

Sites such as Instagram, Facebook, Google, YouTube, UgeTube and many others advertise with banners on the web, while stores such as Target, Walmart and many other well known big box stores maximize using huge displays in there locations.  We can simply power on any device to see a person eating some random snack or food, dressed in some fashion label's clothing and they are off to the races infuences minds to run out and buy or support that company. 

These companies do not share pros and cons in advertisements.  Sharing the cons as well would make less revenue for the companies therefore they do not.
