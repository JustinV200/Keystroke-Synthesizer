I think people should focus on reaching their own goals and improving themselves first.  I think to truly love yourself and be someone that others want to be around you have to have yourself sorted out.  It's definitely not easy and I think most people learn this later than they wish.  We often think that someone else will make us happy but it just doesn't work that way.

It sounds admirable and great to always try to make others happy.  In some situations people can be that selfless and they can do great things with others.  I think it's rare though.  I just feel like it's very easy to not take care of yourself if you're constantly trying to make others happy at your own expense.  I think the word I'm looking for is neglect.  I think focusing on yourself makes it less likely that you neglect to take care of yourself.  

Happiness is ever elusive and we all think we know how to get it.  However I think the older you get you realize that only you alone and can make yourself truly happy.  Once you are confident and achieving your goals you will naturally attract other people.  They will want to be around you and will thus be happy being around you.  I'm not very good at writing I know.
