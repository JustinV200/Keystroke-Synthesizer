As the days go on our society becomes more and more materialistic. My grandparents always taught me that making and having memories with your loved ones will always be the most valuable things in life. Over the years I have realized how true this really was. 

It seems majority of our younger society is always worried about having what everyone else has, or getting their hands on the most trending item, but yet most of these people that behave this way feel like they are entitled to it or that they "deserve" it. These kids are very materialistic and most do not even know the value of a dollar. 

I do not feel like it is wrong to be materialistic. In fact, if you work hard and earn your material items, I am proud of you! It is great to set goals for getting a better, higher paying job, or to save up to purchase a new house, new car, or the latest electronic for you or your family. What I do criticize though is the newer generation that is growing up with everything handed to them, not having worked a day in their life, and feeling like they deserve the world.

Your life and happiness is not soley based on materialistic items. Yes, they are great, fun, and make you happy. But finding someone rather it be a spouse, kids, or even a friend, that you can go on adventures with or spend time doing things you truly enjoy and are passionate about will show you how little the material things truly matter.
