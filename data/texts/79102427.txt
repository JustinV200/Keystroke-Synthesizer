Modern society is a consumerist society.  In an average day, a typical American is exposed to between 6,000 to 10,000 advertisements every day.  It is this constant barrage of advertisements that can cause some people to want to purchase as many things as they possibly can.  For many, it is this collection of products that turn them into materialistic people, often through no fault of their own.

It is no wonder that many people in the United States are materialistic.  Modern society is mostly to blame for these types of people.  Advertisers, marketers, and companies all want to sell you as much stuff as they can.  This is the ultimate root of the materialistic society that we live in.  Companies have to constantly increase sales and grow their business in order to satisfy their investors.  They have little to no concern about what their constant push to buy their products does to society.

"All suffering is caused by desire" is a quote by Buddha.  He recognized this in his society over 2600 years ago.  It is a flaw of the human condition.  The desire to obtain as many material objects as possible causes many people to suffer unnecessarily.  Society in general would all be better off if we all became a little less materialistic.  If everyone would have a little bit more will power to not cave into the lure of product advertising, purchase a little less goods and services, we would all be in a better place.
