They say sex sells but what they don't say is that the media is manipulating you everyday. The images and impressions that we see in advertising and on the news has a profound effect on our psyche and on our view of the world as a whole. At first it isn't obvious because we're too drawn into the illusion and fantasy that lots of entertainers and public figures display to us everyday.

One example is when the media is talking about political figures in particular because it is extremely prevelant in that sphere. One story can give you the impression that a female political figure is fighting tooth and nail against the republican establishment but in reality they're going up against a well known democrat who has around the same political views as them just more experience. And a lot of people eat naratives like hers up because of preconceived notions they were already holding. Another example is when a celebrity messes up and does something really bad such as scamming their audience of lots of money. But then they make a big show of turning their life around and everyone forgets about the controversy and accepts and defends them. Part of this is probably the halo effect that is put on celebrities but also people really like to be sold a narrative so they'll give a celebrity the benefit of the doubt because that's more entertaining than holding them accountable for the terrible things they do to others.

An arguement against this would be that political figures are usually called out for lying and while that might be true your average viewer will probably not do the research to find out if they're lying or not because they want to believe the narative the person is selling them. Especially if they believe in some preconceived notion the person is trying to exploit for their own benefit. 

In conclusion, the media is actively lying to you and it would do us all greatly if everyone were to think more critically about who they follow and also our government.
