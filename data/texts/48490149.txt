We've all had the opportunity to help others in need of support or encouragement. Whether it be a friend, an acquaintence, or even a stranger, there are many situations in which we are able to help other people. While taking care of your own business and reaching your own goals is important, valuable, and necessary, helping others instead of only yourself brings the ultimate and most fulfilling joy one can experience in life.

There are many examples throughout history that prove by helping others instead of only helping yourself, you will experience more happiness and fulfilment. For example, Jesus in the Holy Bible was a master at putting others before himself. One example of this is when Jesus washed the feet of his disciples before he was to be crucified on the cross. To do something like this - wash feet - is a prime example of focusing on others, encouraging them, and showing his disciples how to be selfless. He helped widows, prostitutes, people overtaken by demons, Pharisees, and others find freedom, joy, forgiveness, and grace among other things. He was constantly focusing on other people and the improvement of humanity.

Jesus was one of the happiest and most joyful people Christians know in the Bible today, which is why he had so many followers who were loyal to him. The examples Jesus gave us in his short life show that directing attention towards others more than yourself will have a greater impact on not only their happiness, but yours.
