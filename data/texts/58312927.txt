                           I would agree on the point and support that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals than people focusing on the happiness of others based on certain reasons that are lisited below.
                           I would say that people who are focusing on their personal goals have more discipline and successful growth over their life as a result they are more likely to be happy in their personal life and social lif. But the people whose who focus on others happiness instead of focusing on personal goals seems to be less disciplined and not much successful in both of their personal and social life which is stated on a public survey conducted in the year of 2021 by a private company. And people found to be less stressed without having a fear of insecurities when they focus on their happiness over others happiness. I am a person who focus on my personal goals and doesn't care about others which helps me to be more successful in my career.
                          Thus by the above reasons I conclude that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals than people focusing on the happiness of others.
