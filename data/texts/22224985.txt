I believe modern society should be ashamed at how materialistic we've  all gotten. Often it's all people care about. It's gotten to the point where people won't even date each other or marry unless the person has a level of luxury. Those things are nice and all but there's more to life than that. That's what I believe and try to embrace.
If you only care about what kind of stuff you can get, you really just worship money. That leaves a hole inside of you and leaves you disconnected from your soul. A lot of times the people that are struggling in life have a greater connection to that which I would call God, or the divine. When you are busy with your gadgets and going to parties and things like that, or trying to compete to get a better car than your neighbor, you don't really connect to that part of yourself. It leaves us stressed and constantly looking for validation from others.
People are not their true selves anymore. Everyone is putting a price tag on everything, including each other. You can see it when you walk around now, no one cares about each other's personality and morals. It's all about what can you do for me and what kind of status you have in society. What things can I either scam you out of or use you for. That's not the way humans are supposed to live. Our modern lives have really blinded us from what's important.
In our suffering and hardships, comes that divine light that is deep within us. In our times of quiet desperation, true connection to God is created and strengthened. We've lost this in the new high tech, fast paced world we're in. Now it's all about getting that new car or electronic device, and then rubbing it everyone's face on social media. Also women are manipulating men any way they can to try and get married to powerful men, many of them are just looking to get a divorce later and take half the assets. The ego is running wild in many people and it's not healthy. Hopefully we can re-learn what's really important soon.
