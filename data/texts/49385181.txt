Competition can drive people to push themselves harder to achieve their individual goals; however, true lasting success in any career requires focusing on more than just ourselves. The old saying, "It's not what you know; it's who you know" applies here. That quote could be extended to add, "...and how you are percieved by those who know you."

Many people approach networking (including with others in their own organization) with only their own career and goals in mind. This is a mistake. The key to success in networking is to be genuinely interested in others, and embrace a spirit of cooperation. Instead of viewing your rivals as enemies, make friends with them. Ask yourself not just what others can do for you, but what you could do for them in turn, and what you can bring to the table as a whole. Only then can you be recognized as a valuable member of a team or network, which you can then use as leverage to rise up your chosen career ladder.

Many will argue that focusing on others' needs sets a person up to be taken advantage of. Often this is true. We may spend valuable time mentoring someone else, helping them with their work, or introducing them to key people, but then they never turn around and do the same for us. The best way to approach this is to think of investing in relationships as though it is any business venture or investment: Without taking risk, there is no potential reward.

It is also true that many of the most successful people have stepped on others in order to get where they are. For example, many have accused Bill Gates of this. However, people who have acheived a high degree of success also knew how to cooperate with others and memorized the tenants of Dale Carnegie's famous book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People."

I argue that the latter ability was most important to their success (even if the former also contributed). No one can become truly successful if they don't play well with others.
