             Cooperation and competition are a major facts to discuss in the present day situation. Now a days these two are more important to the human life. Cooperation means is a jioning of a group people and sharing their knowledges. Competition is one persons victory and other people will failure.

                             Cooperations correct meaning is a group of people joint together and sharing their ideas and knowledges. In cooperation there is a lot of chance to discuss their ideas and problems and they get so many instructions. Cooperation helps peoples to recover from their problems and got a solution. In cooperation we get so any ideas and clarifying our doubt to others and there no ego between others all are together. Here different people joining and different behavior jions together and it's make a togertherness world.

                                      Competition is a single man victory others will loose. There is moral value to the human feelings. Competition build a ego and complex world. In comprtition peoples look others like their enemy all are their opponant. This makes a complex world and no values to human feelings in the new world of comlex. In my suggession cooperation is more powerful than competition because in competition there is start of a complex and ego. But cooperation make a joining nature and build a perfect bonding with peoples. Now days we need competition and cooperation but more important is cooperation because the new world of digitalisation peoples live in the room no intractions with others. So cooperation will make a change in the current situation.
