First I like to say a proverb which directly resembles this prompt, "Don't judge a book by its cover'. It represents that the out looks and the appreance of an object or people does not match their abilities and their characters. We all are living around this type of prompt. 
Taking the example shown in the promt, The colorful package food items which we buy from  the stores are not all are healthy and not good foe health. The out looks of the packages provide to be brighter to attract th epeople to but it, But not all the products are bad in quality, Only some of the products are not safe.
Like that people are also same. Some of the person looks differ from their habits and actions they do. Some seem to be very rugged or unattractive but they have a good caring and sympathic mind. Some look to be very polite and calm in apperance but they will be harsh and weird in their approaches. It shows the differs in the out look  and the habit or character of people with others.
So all the products or people outlook we see will definetily differs from the inner them, The products may be healthier or bad, The people may good or bad. So don't judge anything by their outer apperance.
