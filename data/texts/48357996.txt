               As we have the need of essential things like food,shelter,dress , we have to earn money earnestly in all the possible way in our daily life. We also need money for our education , entertainment and safety purpose of emergency needs like hospital bills.these are the essential part of our life.As we are in the materialistic world our fellow humans too respect as for our wealth, money,assets and deposits we have in our name. so,we have to sacrifice our largest time for earning money to be socially acceptable.
                 
               For example the type of  car one have in their name shows his personality to the world.To show the society thier worth and to be socially acceptable they spend as much money they can in their car purchase.
             
          They have have to have a car in thier garage to show thier worth to the society.So as the member of this society we have to be realistic and as per the proverb "Live like a Roman while you are in Rome"
                  
           so we as well have to be a materialistic person as well as a happy person with our family and friends
