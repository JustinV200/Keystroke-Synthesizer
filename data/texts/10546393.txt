In this time that we live in, the world at large is encouraged to aquire all of the latest technology, the most expensive houses, the newest cars, and many other items.  This is not necessary, and in fact causes more harm than good. 

For example, the idealogy of always trying to get more belongings puts an extreme amount of stress on the bread-winner(s) of a family unit.  The additional work hours, the deprived sleep, and the heavy burden of a mountain of debt takes away from any pleasure that is gained from obtaining all that one can. 

Others may point out the time saving attributes and high performance of all of their extra and not inexpensive items.  The ease the items provide, the entertainment value they bring, and providing all the latest gadgets to their children are all worth the effort required to pursue these purchases. 

However, I believe many people are missing out on precious time with their families.   Spouses and children care most about being loved and time spent together.  Relationships have suffered and failed due to this strong desire to have the latest thing.  Children miss their parents and do not feel loved when one or both of the parents are regularly absent.  

It is apparent to me that if less time was spent on obtaining possessions, and more time was spent enjoying the simple things in life, so much would improve overall in respect to mental and physical health.  We all would be in a better place if we stopped trying to add to our belongings, and instead enjoyed all that we already have.
