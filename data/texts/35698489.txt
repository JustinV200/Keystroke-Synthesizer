No, society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Material things are a source of joy for many people and it's only natural for people to possessions. However, if material items become more important than people, that is what should be criticized. Life is more important than possessions.

Posessions should never be made at the expense of someone's well-being. For example, if producing a good means that people are subjected to unsafe working conditions, then that good isn't worth having. I would never want someone to have to sacrifice their lives so I could have a material good.

Also, you shouldn't sacrifice spending time with your loved ones for the sake of your possessions. If all you do is work so you can earn money to buy things, then you aren't spending enough time with your loved ones. You need to balance spending time with people and spending time earning money.

It's also important to relax. Taking care of your possessions should never interfere with your ability to relax and enjoy the little things in life. If all you do is stress out about your possessions, then they own you, you do not own them.

So no, materialism should not be criticized. What should be criticized is when people prioritized possessions over people and their own well-being.
