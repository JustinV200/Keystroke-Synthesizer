     There is a known saying, "don't judge a book by it's cover." Why is that? Well, things are not always what they appear to be on the outside. With this in mind, it's clear that the impressions people have on objects and people everyday affect them more than it should.  Social media, advertisements, and entertainment has created a false reality, and it affects the way people live their lives everyday.
    Generally speaking, people have been guided by what they see through entertainment, social media, and advertisements. These platforms show images of body types, standards of beauty, and lifestyles that are idealistic, but unreal.  For example, a popular celebrity shows that having a flashy new car would make you more cool and interesting. However, what we do not see is that the celebrity received the car as a gift and not through hard work, how little the celebrity actually drives the car, or the cost of repairs and maintenance of the car. The reality of the affluent lifestyle is not seen. Yet, people will take images like this and base their own desires and dreams on it.
    At the same time, people might say that images and impressions through entertainment, advertisements, and social media help to enhance lifestyles. All things considered, it would enhance a person right into debt. Trying to keep up with what is portrayed on any platform is not the way to happiness. Additionally, it will only encourage you to spend more than you make, causing you to survive instead of thrive, preventing you from living your best life. 
   Ultimately, it's important to consider how images and impressions affect your outlook on life. Does this false reality encourage you to live outside of your means? Does it make you want to stray away from your internal goals and interests? If so, the impressions that you have on objects and people might be affecting you more than it should.
