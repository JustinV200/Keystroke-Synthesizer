     Do the thigs that we see around us truly represent what they really are or do we judge more based on appearances?
     When we look around us, we see people dressed in certain ways. We see a brand name shoe or purse; a comercial for product. Based on what we see, are we judging the person or product based on the image or reality.
     When we look at a person walking down the street and notice that they are wearing what looks like an offbrand or old clothing, we might see them as being less well to do. On the other hand, when we see someone wearing expensive looking clothes or shoes, we tend to see that person as being more well to do and capable.
     Look at the candidates in any election; the CEO of a large company, appearing in a commercial or the person who stops you on the street to talk with you. Some might see the way they are dressed and think that they are capable and that we should vote for or buy their product. 
     The same can be said for how we see and view everyday people, that we encounter. Do we see them as being poor because they are wearing old clothes. The reality is that the person wearing the old clothes is more than what we perceive them to be. The same can be said for a well dressed person. They may seem well to do and trustworthy based on appearances, but in reality they could be the person who is trying to gain your confidence and scam you.
     Instead, we should look at the product itself or the persons actions, to base a decision on. By doing this, we can make a more informed decision instead of assuming that a person; such as a well dressed politician or business person will do a good job or a product be good.
     In the end, the decision is one for each of us to make; whether we see just an image or look beyond to the actial person or product. By reading this, it is my hope that you will take just a moment and look beyond what you think you see and really look and think.
