How come we have learned that the more we consume, the happier we will be? Who decided that the modern society should depend to heavily on materialistic pleasures? It wasn't you, I will presume, and it certainly wasn't me; then who?
Materialism now feels like second nature to any modern woman or man despite growing research that this habit we have embraced so readily may not even be so good for us all. How come the more we work to earn more money, the less happy we feel in our family? How could we value a new car over our friendships? Multiple studies have linked materialism to lower levels of well-being, diminished prosocial behavior, and even more ecologically destructive behavior.
While we go about our lives thinking money and possessions are the solutions to all of our problems, many others are realizing that you can't really buy true happiness. Yes, it might be possible to buy some level of comfort, impress friends or potential partners with our means, feel a little better about our days, but how about all that we put at stake by relying in such way to earthly belongings? Will we feel so well if we were to lose anything that gave us such comfort? Will our friends or partners still be impressed in the absence of all the materialistic resources we offered them? How unhappy will we be, should the unimaginable happen - that we, one day, lose all of our belongings? What else do we left to rely on?
True happiness cannot be bought, but comes from within. While the comfort that materialistic pleasures can be appreciated in the short-run, we can't rely on them forever. We must find the happiness and peace within; impress our family, friends or lovers with what *we* have to offer, with our hearts and personalities, with our kindness and compassion and not our wallet. Nothing that can be bought could ever be as valuable as something that comes from the heart.
