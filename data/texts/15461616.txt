Success can either be achieved through competition or by the power of cooperation. People can be driven to succeed by engaging in rivalry and for some, they can be driven to achieve more by working together with other people as a cohesive unit in a group setting. 
I believe that competition can lead people to succeed more in our current world situation today. I believe that a goal of winning against others can make people more determined in trying harder. I grew up in a generation where everybody wins a prize. It turns into a bad idea when it stops people from getting motivated because whether they try hard or do not try at all, well, everybody is a winner. I believe that people needs a push to be better, and that means knowing that not everyone can be winners. The reward is sweeter when you know that because you work harder, you emerge better than others. This contributes to more confidence in trying, better goal-setting abilities, better skills, and breakthroughs.
Cooperation is also good in achieving success because it provides people with support and an added boost they need to keep on going by working side by side with others. It is also fun to share success together. But, I do believe that an individual needs to learn to be confident in themselves first before they can be better contributors to a group accomplishment.  
In summary, both competition and cooperation are good ways to achieve success. Each one can be applied in different situations depending on what is fit for different people and in different situations. Healthy competition is just a better way in achieving more success because it teaches the individual to be more focused and self-motivated.
