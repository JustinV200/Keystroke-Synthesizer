In Modern world, we are too fast  in our activitites. In this sitution, we loose our real originality. We do not not patient enought to learn about the things around us. We often accept the things without knowing thier original values. These are the things are example for mistaking our reality.
    
     Products are only good at their outlook but inside there are so many flavors and chemicals added to it. Advertisement makes our eyes colorful and easily divert our mind towards it.  Often seeing this advertisemnet in media we attracted towards the product and simply buy the product whethere it is necessary or not necessary. People also buy things not only for their needs but also for show off to other people.  In this area mistaking things are happening in larger amount.

     Not only in the products we are mistaking the things but also in day to day life. For example, We often attracted by the words of the other people and do unneccary things. In election, people are attracted by the election manifesto of the politician but fail  to note their efficiency in the real life. Wrong person will mislead the country and make our country worthless. It is our primary duty to see the original reality and make our environment safe to  all generation. If young generation know the value of the reality and not mistaking things easily  our country will become super power in the world.
