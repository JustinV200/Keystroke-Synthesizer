More often than not we as humans all want suceed in life. We are taught as children we can be anything we desire and to "reach for the stars". It is only natural coming into adulthood to be the best you that you can be. But at what cost? If you were to ask the average person they'd probably say competion is healthy. That its in our nature since the dawn of time "survival of the fittest" and all that. But in my oppinion, and those who dont have an outlook on life as a speed track with an undying need to get to the finish line, cooperation will always rank supreme. 
I dont dissagree that competition can be healthy in many scenarios. It's motivational and can create results, with ofocurse the winner/ loser aspect in the endgame. The havoc that "unhealthy" competion can make is the big issue not where is starts. Life should always be about enjoying small gains not being the first to get them. There is a quote that i love by Lana Dingwall that says "It is hard to embody abundance and possibility when you are comparing yourself to someone else." It couldnt be more on the nose. Cooperation provides the ability for sucess to be shared and celebrated as a community to reach common goals. Everyone should strive to bring out the best in eachother.
