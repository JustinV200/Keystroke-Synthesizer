Nowadays we all run after only appearances and impressions. We Judge everything by these. We judge both human and product by their appearances. If the appearances and impressions of something are good then we decide this to be  good. We do not check the quality of this. Even if something that has a good quality looks not impressing we decide that to be bad.


Actually images and impressions are not everything. It is not fair to judge everythinmg by their appearances. Everyone and everything should be perceived by their quality.

In our daily life we usually sees the reality. When we run after the apperances then we lose everthing. It is just like a trap. When we will judge the impressions we will lose everything.


If the appearances and impressions will be everything then we win every time because we run after the impressions most of the time. But the reality is different. When we do this all time we lose the genuine thing. So the impressions and pces are not everything. And these have not too much of an effect on people.


For the reality I believe that the appearances and impressions are not everything all the time for any kind of things and in any situations.
