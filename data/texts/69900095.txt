In this era society has been changed termendeously. The thinking and approach of people towards life has changed alot. People are too much into metarialistic thing. Though people vary from each other and every person has some preferences and priorities in their lives, but its a normal trend nowadays their craze about materialistic things.
                     Materialistic things such buy newly launched apple I phone which worth thousands of dollar, branded apple watch , LV and gucci bags etc. There is no about it gives a person happiness and satisfaction. But the satisfaction we get by spending thousand of dollars on these things is minuscle. Its really temporary and then we want something new. Being trendy and upto date is not wrong, but being in continuous rat race to be best led you in anxiety and depression.
             People mostly indulge in materialism for the sake of pleasing people. They want to get approval from the people to accept them . As they are very modern and upto-date people and I think its the worst thing that anybody is doing.
           Most people when they get mature and go through ups and down of life get to know that, these materialistic things are really short lived and gives temporary happiness. The happiness belongs to your peace of mind , inner satisfaction and strengthen your relationship with God.
          At the end, I want to say its not bad to buy something which you like but continuously becoming the part vicious cycle of being materialistic just for the sake of pleasing people is useless and gives you nothing except  mental instability.
