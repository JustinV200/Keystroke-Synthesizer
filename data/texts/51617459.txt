Materialism dates back to earlier times, not just modern society.  The invasion of lands from neighboring territories by various societies many years ago - the Normans, the Egyptians, the Romans, etc., brought about many instances of materialism at that time.

How much gold did they need? How much land, silk, money, and other items of status? History books portray the Roman empire to be one of much indulgence and vulgar use of possessions. 

Perhaps in today's world, as we have learned a lot from history, the idea of materialism is related to our basic needs. Basically we need that new smartphone, that new sweater, that new car because our society tells us we must have them. We are told through social media, advertisements, tv, our best friends that we must have these things, even though we don't.

Modern society cannot be blamed for being materialistic because this is what we are expected to be. It is up to the individual to disregard their persausive surroundings and give up the materal items. We will probably find that we really don't need these things at all. This includes giving up trying to be something that we aren't or can't be.

Just remember the saying ,"I don't need the money, but the people I owe sure do". 

Modern society can be criticized for being materialistic but not necessarily to blame.
