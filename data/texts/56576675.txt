       I think that many things we achieve such as goals or possessions will give us a short lived happiness. There is nothing wrong with the desire and pursue of those things. Ultimately we can gain the happiness. However the stage of being happy because of these things or status are mostly short lived. Once we feel like we are at the peak of the mountain, it is hard to sustain the feeling for an extended period of time without the sense of losing the immediate fame or excitment over it.

      However, when one focus on the goods of others, the benefit of that knowledge the you impacted someone else would be much long lasting. Even you do not see the influence or impact, the fact you have been part of someone else's positive experience will be like a item on your resume, you will be able to carry it in your mind for a much longer time. For those improvements of others that you can see results or influence immediately- the happiness they bring is beyond one's personal success can compare. Rewarding, heart warming and sense of contribution to the human kind.  

       Also when it comes to personal goals- it is true that one will gain the joy of achieving one's goal, however,  besides the associated joy being short lived, the likelihood that one will have more goals will be like an endless pursue, a marathon. It will be a devastating feeling if you cannot achieve a particular goal. In contrast, the urge to help others will always be a positive experience, even at times we can only do so much, but we are being selfless. Happiness can be found along the path of helping others.

     Therefore I strongly believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others than their personal goals.
