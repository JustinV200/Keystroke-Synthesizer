Are we living in a material world?  Most would argue that we are, indeed, obsessed with our possessions.  The question is, should we be criticized for this or are we entitled to be happy in whatever way we desire?  

There was a time when materialism was associated with status and selfishness, but modern society is proving that is not the case.  People tend to be more conscious of brands and where they do spend their hard earned money.  With loads of information available about the products we are interested in, we can make more informed decisions that align with our beliefs and expectations.  There is a mindset that you are allowed to endulge and treat yourself when you've earned it.  With the economy struggling, most people are working hard just to pay their bills and don't get a chance to spend much on themselves.  When they do, it's well deserved.  It's absurd to say that we all wouldn't be a little happier if we had more money to spend on ourselves.  

It is important to remember there is balance in spending money on yourself now and investing in yourself later.  Materialism can still cause a fair share of problems.  It is easy to get carried away and put yourself into debt, or even worse, others into debt.  It is important to remember that instant gradification is not the same as happiness.  Sometimes it is worth holding off on purchases that will only make us happy now and saving for a future purchase that will give us lasting happiness.

In a materialistic world, it is not a crime to spend money on yourself.  Don't forget that you are in charge of your own happiness.  If a new outfit will give you the confidence to ace your interview for your dream job, then it's a win for everyone.
