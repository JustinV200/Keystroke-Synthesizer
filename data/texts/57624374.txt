In my opinion, the question of "materialism" doesn't date from modern times. Materialism has always been the antagonist of "modesty".  In my walk of life, I've always considered money as a necessity to everyday livelihood. I refused to be a slave to it as an instrument. Thus to me, materialism can be looked at as a "love for money and what it can ornament". Is that in itself a problem? Is materialism a problem in which a society should be criticized? For me, no.

Another school of thought may raise the point that materialism has caused a dimish in the outlook of value in the society. What individuals are willing to go through to obtain said materialistic stature, lifestyle, upkeep. As a simple person, I dont possess alot of "material possessions" thats my choice of lifestyle. To another they find a "need" to be materialistic to gauge their worth not only for themselves but their image as well. What I ponder is, if its worth it. What hoops your willing to hop through to obtain such status?... 

In all, to each their own honestly. So again, If the question is if society should be criticized? No.
The individuals should be. What society terms as "materialistic" may indeed be what is needed to increase their value in areas needed for it prosperity and that, to me, shouldn't be criticized. It should be evaluated towards the betterment of society.
