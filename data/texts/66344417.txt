Happiness, it seems to me, is a feeling that is bigger and broader than the self. It is finding a place in the world and being in community with those around you. So I tend to think that the pathway towards achieving happiness is one that focuses beyond one's particular, personal goals and looks towards the happiness of others.
     Focusing on one's own dreams to the exclusion of caring for others is a limited vision that may achieve a passing pleasure but keeps you from being in meaningful relationship with others. You may indeed get to the goal of having your luxurious mansion. But does that achievement have any meaning when it can't be shared with others you love? The proverbial Jonses, with whom we are all aiming to keep up with, may gaze upon your material achievements with envy, but that isn't a measure of genuine happiness.
     Putting your efforts and energies towards goals that are greater than yourself, having a sense of the bigger picture, and trying to help those around you is a more assured path towards actually being happy. Perhaps you might not achieve acquiring quite so huge a mansion if your goals aren't solely fueled by selfish desire but what you do achieve will bring joy to others and nurture relationships that may last a lifetime. And I think happiness is best found there.
     The peril and danger of only caring about one's personal goals is that it doesn't consider the world around you. And without that gauge, a person can become grotesquely selfish. Success and happiness shouldn't come from disregarding or exploiting others. That kind of motivation only produces rotten fruit. The best and sweetest end, the happiest turnout is when you know you have helped another person in some way, big or small, and brought more joy into the world. The world could use more joy and we all benefit from that in the end.
