     I believe that more people achieve success through competition. While cooperation is a great way for others to work together to achieve something that has been done before, competition is a superior way to innovate, and to inspire others to push to be better, and to ultimately do what has never been done before. Cooperation merely drives us to work harmoniously, while competition drives us to work better, and harder.
      There is nothing wrong with working together harmoniously, but great inventions and great discoveries were not made because of people working together happily. They were the results of tireless work from men and women who were pushing to become better than their peers, to differentiate themselves from competitors and in the process discover and/or achieve something never thought possible before.
      A perfect example is the space race of the 1960s, in which the US and Russia were working tirelessly to get a man first into space, and then onto the moon. The US and Russia could have cooperated and worked together to achieve this goal, but instead, it became a competition, and that competition pushed us to accelerate our space program, and push furiously to innovate ahead of the Russians, and ultimately launch a man up onto the moon within a matter of years, something that up until that point had seemed only like science fiction.
     In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with cooperation, and success cannot always come from working alone or against others. But to truly innovate, and to reach beyond what anyone thought was possible, the best way is through competition, when we inspire each other and ourselves to do better, in the pursuit of something better.
