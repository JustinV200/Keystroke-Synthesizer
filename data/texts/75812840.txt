Items of standards, worth, beauty, class are all attached to value. The more the value the more the satisfaction, eye appealing and tempting it gets for every human, and all this circles materialism. Where our satisfaction lies, happiness is an ally. So basically materialism contributes to our happiness, something key in our lives.

But should modern society really be critized for being materialistic? Is materialism an evil in our society or a virtue that defaultly comes as a result of modern day lifestyle. Something that I'll strongly criticize and hold still to name it as an unacceptable vice that should be greatly condemned. Materialism has washed out all our morals, humanity, brought along high levels of class segregations, inequality, imbalanced distribution of opportunities, just because value can be distinguished and categorized, leaving some people happy and others soaking in their sadness.

Buying a gucci handbag might give you satisfaction because of the prestige and luxurioness attached to the brand name. But at what cost? This only helps certain brands prevail leaving the local minor brands unnoticed, with very few sales and zero chance to grow with probably better quality, unique and grand designs. You as a buyer gets happy, but at the expense of denying others opportunity. How about those who can't afford such, you go around despising them, classifying them as poor, humiliating them, simply because they can't afford the same value as you. This kills humanity. 

The society gets to classify those who can afford the expensive brands as rich and those who cant as poor, bringing about social domineerance. It will never be right. On one hand it might feel right being able to afford something expensive, being recognized and noticed but this brings along a lot of damage to outside parties
