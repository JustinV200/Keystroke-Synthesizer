I today will try to understand if images and colors have too much of an effect on people. Many people think that the color of packaging in stores or otherwise have an effect on making people choose a product or service. It is an issue that a lot of money in research is put in
 
I think it does have a very large effect on peoples choices . There are many examples of this going into effect. From the placement of the product on shelves or color contast many companies invest in this heavily. I believe it happens subconiencly when people act on this. Many people are very loyal to their favorite brands and imaging is certainly important . I ould like to see mmore research into the positive and negitives of this in action.
  
I think this most likely has a net negitive effect on the average person. It would cloud their judgement and may end up with items they don't need or could of got a better verison of the product. I think the average consumer would be positivily impacted by the limmiting and regulation of product images and colors. I would be happy to see a future of less provacative packing and displays.

 I hope after reading this you will think more about this impacting your choices and try to overlook such tactics. I think if we are all more mindful of this we will be happier and live better lives. If we all just try alittle harder we can improve this without the need of regulations or any laws. I would ask for you to look at yourself when these situations come up in your life. I hope you at least question it more after reading this essay.
