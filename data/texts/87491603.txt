I understand that people love to aquire possesions because it makes happy . Experiences are much more important. You create new memories by having meaningful experiences. I don't think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Every single person should be allowed to live their life the way they want to as long as it doesn't cause harm to someone else. If a person wants to acquire this and that it doesn't affect me at all. 

If they want to work and spend their money on nice cars or stuffed animals why should it be any of our concern? Since the dawn of time people have always wanted more and more. Life is too complicated as it is . If people would just relax unwind and simplify their life. You spend all your life working and acquiring stuff for what ? When you die you can't take it with you. It's left to your family to fight and fuss over.

Although I can understand criticizing society for being materailistic because I do that. It's so unfair for there to be homelessness and people going hungry when some people own million dollar cars. I completly criticize some people for owning so much when others have so little. Hardwork has nothing to do with it . If you were born into a certain class of people then you have a much lower chance of achieving wealth. I guess what it boils down to is I can see both sides of the arguement.
