    I believe that images and impressions do have too much of an impact on people. There are many reasons to support this.
   First, social media plays a major role on impressioning people. Adults, teens, etc. see these celebs and social media influencers sharing things. What we see if one thing but what it actually real like is different. We see what looks to be like a perfect life and what they are recommending when in reality they could just be getting paid for what they are representing. 
   Also, we definitely take things for face value as a society. We see a pretty package or something someone recommended and think this is the best. I believe, as a society, we have lost the ability to form our own opinions and think for ourselves. We are pushing things on impressionable and young people who take things at face value without doing the research behind products or what they see on tv and social media.
   Overall, I believe that people are not forming their own ideas and opinions because we are surrounded by so much advertising. We have lost the ability to figure out what we truly need for ourselves, as well as trying to do our own research.
