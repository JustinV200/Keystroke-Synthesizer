When you achieve all you want for yourself in life, will you be happy? I wonder if that is a question many people ask themselves in their lifetime. We strive to do be rich, popular, smart, succesful, important, and so many other things, but does it really matter? I don't know if it does. If it did, we wouldn't see depression and suicide in people that have achieved these things in life, which we do. What if true happiness comes from something or someone else?

People that focus on others and other people's needs are generally joyful, happy people. They are finding joy in helping and caring for others that are unable to care for themselves. We are created to love others and if we are always focusing on ourselves, we will not fulfill what we were created for. It brings a different joy and happiness to know that you did something to help improve someone elses life, whether it is their mental, financial, or physical situation. 

In conclusion, I don't think that true happiness is found in trying to be successful in your own endeavors. True happiness is found in loving and caring for the people around us because that is what we were created to do.
