There is an old proverb that calls for finding "meaning in the journey, not the destination." As an extension of meaning, I believe this saying applies to how we find happiness as well. We feel happiness when we have found meaning in our lives, and meaningful (or meaning-filled) goals are always formed in relation to others and their happiness. 

As an example, if one were to have the goal of becoming the owner of a Fortune 500 company, the meaning in that goal would be derived from others. These others could be the owner's employees, the people the company is providing services to, or really anyone. The reason why the person wants to be an owner could also vary from wanting to make more money than anyone else they know to being able to impact people in a helpful and inspiring way. No matter what, if this owner were the only person left on the planet, there is no point in running a Fortune 500 company. There is no one to beat out, no one to assist, no one to work for them, and no one to influence. 

In this way,  they may have achieved their goal of running a large company, but what is the point? 

Some say that happiness comes from achieving your personal goals. This is often what the world wants us to believe: If we work hard enough then we will most certainly reach our goals, and if we reach our goals then we will most certainly be happy. What happens, though, when we try our hardest and we are unable to succeed because of factors out of our control? Or if we do reach our goals and experience that happiness, what comes after that exhilerating high which we had been promised?

Setting out for and achieving goals is important and there are many who have greatly impacted the world for the rest of us by striving for their intense goals. Unfortunately, when goals are achieved for yourself, there is often a hollow happiness that comes along with it. There may be a flicker of excitement, but that will die away.
