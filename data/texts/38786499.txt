All that glitters isn't gold. Simple enough to understand right? So why are we so taken in by appearances, and don't care about actual substance? I will be discussing society's obession with looks over substance. 

At some time or another we all have fallen for a smooth talking politican, or maybe a fast talking used car salesman has talked you into more car than you can afford. We as a society need to see past the pretty shiny objects that distract us, and focus on the actual issues. Ads that make food appear more attractive than it is is one thing, but what happens when we can't see past the shallow and actual policy issues are at stake? Charismatic politicians and church leaders can lead us down a path of division and hatred, cloaked by their shining  personalities. We need to start focusing on people's actual abilities and stances on policy issues, instead of how they present themselves. 

Some would argue what's the harm in being flashy? Sometimes being flamboyant is the best way to get the point across, and no real harm is being done. In certain instances those whom make that arguement are correct. For example a kindergarten teacher overly emoting to make a lesson engaging for students, or a politician being folksy to get a point across. Small instances of things like that are fine, but should be used in moderation. 

Critical thinking skills need to be emphasized in this country. We all need to learn how to conduct our own research using reliable sources. The ability to seperate truth from fiction, and actual substance over superficial matters. Sometimes you need to question what's in the pretty little package. What looks like a delicious apple could actually be poisonous, and sometimes that poisonous fruit can spread and have far reaching consquences. People being well educated, and possessing critical thinking skills helps society as a whole be a better place. Just remember to not be taken in by that fool's gold.
