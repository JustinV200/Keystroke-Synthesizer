I would say people are more happienes in their self thought and goal, my thoughts is every human are nature in selfiness, and are surviving in the world, the only aim in the world for an average human, make him happy and live peaceful. so that my thoughs people on focusing on the personal goals, you can serach and look in history for the proof, that every dictators, kings, and human are focusing on their personal goals either it can be rulling the country or capturing the other world, their only few people in the world who think about happiness about other, but i would say even there are selfiness in some way , quite they are happi in helping others so it also consider be as slefiness, the word selfiness in this paragraph means achieve the personal goals of the average human, so lets take an man who ages 20 to 25, want sto rule the world, but he cannot achieve his goals without making other hapiness, thats the underline facts every government in the world try to achieve there people, making the people happy government runs smoothly, thats the aim of every government, so my clear cut answer is people more likely to happy only on focusing on their peronsl "GOALS".
