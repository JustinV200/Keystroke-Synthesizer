Happiness is a very controversial topic that has been long debated. What makes a person truly happy? Is there one source of happiness for everyone? Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals or on the happiness of others? I'll provide my opinion on the topic.

I'm a big believer in the idea that people should prioritize taking care of themselves first before they take care of others. In my opinion, people will be happier if they focus on their personal goals before they focus on the happiness of others. If people accomplish their own goals, they'll be more fulfilled in life and have much more confidence in themselves. They will have something to strive and work towards that will give them purpose in life. 

Now some people will argue that if people focus on the happiness of others, the world would be a better place. My argument to that would be that people would prioritize their own goals a little less to make others happy. A person not being able to achieve their own goals might result in them being less fulfilled in life and as a result, less happy with themselves. I also believe people can still make other people happy after they focus on their own happiness first. 

With all this being said, I believe people should focus on their own goals first to be happy. Then they can prioritize making others happy. This way they can do both, but they'd put themselves and their happiness first.
