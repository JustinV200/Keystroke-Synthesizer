                                                                                                         Materialism


                        Materialism is one of the most prominent characteristics of modern times. It is visible in every society, richer or poorer, Eastern or Western, democratic or totalitarian. People strive to gain as much money and property as possible hoping to ensure security and happiness.

                        My experience and knowledge have shown that materialism can be motivating in pursuing life goals and working on self development. But, it has also been proven that one can easily be misguided from the right track - money and properties should never be a goal, but simply a reward for hard work, professionalism, education and constant improvement. One should strive to improve himself in all aspects, perform a life-long-learning, develop creativity and unselfishly offer his unique tallents to his close and loved ones and the society as a whole. Sharing knowledge is a safe and certain way to achieve success, bigger or smaller, that will surely result in material benefits as well.

                        Being focused on gaining quick and large profits can be more of a loss than a gain. One might spend lots of time and energy investing in material aspect of life loosing touch with reality and simple everyday pleasures that essentialy make one`s life happy and fulfilled. Such losses leave scars in human heart and soul and no material richness can ever heal them. Emptiness and wasted time cannot be filled with anything that can be bought.
