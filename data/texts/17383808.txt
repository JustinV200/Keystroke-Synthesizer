Behold this document, printed or in digital format, it has a real material value. Materializing this body of text was a physical neccesity in order to enable the transfer of any ideas contained within. This holds true for any shared information, be it audio, text, video, or some other detectable representation of ideas. In essence, materialism equals existence for all things. It's no surprise that society is forced to operate in a materialistic way.

The foremost reason for being materialistic is our biological limitation of thought. It's understood that our brains, a physical organ, enable us to form thoughts and communicate with others. The material object of our brain defines our thinking. Society is constantly changed by humans based on information we pass down through time. Our ideas, creations, and contributions are all communicated in a material way to our offspring. Experiencing our universe is material by definition. While some claim that thoughts, instincts, and other potentially related knowledge/experiences are immaterial, there is no known way to prove the non-existence of a material based explanation. Biological material like DNA could be a potential example of a material based explanation for instinctual knowledge. As well, all societies operate an economy, which by definition, relies on the exchange of something material. Currency is an essential example. Even societies without currency exchanged materialistic goods or services involving material manipulation.

Without a materialistic method of transferring ideas, there is no known way to evolve a society. The act of existing as biological material binds us to a materialistic fate. Society can try to find another way, but it may never be possible.
