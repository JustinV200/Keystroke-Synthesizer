Cooperation is the key to a succesful mission and the colabaration of ideas spurs innovation. A clear cut mission that drives all participatings towards a common goal is likely to produce the best results. An all hands on deck approach allows all hands to create. With diversity of ideas and a clear cut mission, the sky is the limit.

Let's use an example. In the 1960's, the United States embarked upon the most ambitious venture in our history. We collectively decided it was possible to put a man on the moon. Through cooperation and the generation of multiple ideas towards a common purpose, we did just that. Had there been catfights and a focus on self, this mission could never have successfully been completed. Not only did we put a man on the moon, we did so first. That's the American dream; diversity of ideas all given protection under the law through our freedom of expression. You could make a strong case that such freedom gave us an edge over more autocratic nations that limited indivual freedoms. 

Cynics of this viewpoint will tell you that iron sharpens iron and that may true to some extent. Skilled, assertive individuals may acheive personal success via competitive environments. We often see this in our places of work. The drive to compete against one another does have value. But in the grand scheme of things, big ideas and grand ambitions can only be attained through cooperation. An overlooked aspect of competition is that it lends itself to "participants" focused on not making mistakes as opposed to accomplishment. The moon landing was indeed one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.
