    Materialism isn't necessarily as negative as many people believe it to be. I see no reason that anyone in this modern society should face any criticism for being materialistic. It is unlikely that people will ever stop feeling an urge to acquire new things and spend their money, so we may as well accept it. And why shouldn't we? As long as people obtain their material possessions in a legal and ethical way, it shouldn't be an issue. It's no one elses business what someone else chooses to spend their money on, so go for it! 
     Some people would argue that materialism is a bad thing that can lead to many problems for people and society. Problems related to debt, addiction to buying things, mental issues like a loss of self-worth or anxiety. While that can be true, it is not the norm. Materialism can be beneficial and a good thing for many people. Being able to afford the things you want and buying new things can improve your mood vastly. It can lead you to have more self-esteem and take a positive attitude towards yourself knowing that you have worked hard and been successful enough to spend that money. There's nothing wrong with enjoying the fruits of your labor. The materials someone chooses to buy could be an investment in their future, a small pick-me-up, experiences that create memories that last a lifetime or something to improve their quality of life. I can't find anything negative about that!
     The criticism surrounding materialism is unwarranted and in a lot of instances, it's jealousy and envy that lead to those harsh judgements. People should stop and take a moment to put themselves in someone else's shoes before they start to criticize them for the things they decide to acquire. You never know what someone else is going through and how helpful that materialism could be. It's best to mind your own business when it comes to another's consumerism. Live and let live!
