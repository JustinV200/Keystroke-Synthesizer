In this competitive world everyone likes cooperation in their field because it leads to huge miracles when we encourage this cooperation. My brother is running a leading corporate company and he is facing  huge competition everyday in his surroundings and one fine day his business has become a failure.He avoids cooperation with his collegues everyday he feels stress to a large extent in his life because he like competition to a larger extent than cooperation.

After several years he learnt from an incident from his son who is a leading business magnet because of his cooperative nature. At the last he reset his life, he lost everything because of his competitive ideas and skills. He learned that competition will lead to a big failure we should be cooperate in everything we face and this has made a remarkable change in his life. My brother today has achieved his victory becasue of this everlasting accomplishment. Now he is also a leading bussiness person in his field.

In every success man there is a huge cooperation behind his talents. Competition will broke your talents into failure and you can achieve nothing. If anyone likes to achieve success in their life you should focus on this cooperation which will bring you a remarkable success everywhere you go and I really learned this from my brother and I really liked it. Power of cooperation is a good one when we compare it with the competition. Most people like this coopeartion because it will brings them a good commitment in their life and business. Cooperation is always a Best competition.
