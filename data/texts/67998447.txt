           Society today seems to be too materialistic.  We have lost our way and ability to  enjoying each other's time, instead, it is evaluating what someone owns.  Social media has provided a platform environment of trying to keep up with each other.  People try to get more likes and attention based on what they own.  They tend to share things that previously wouldn't have been know unless you hung out with them on a regular basis.  It has provided a life changing platform for society.
           The younger society needs to re-evaluate how they think, and how they've been taught to think.  They are the ones we need to focus on, since they have time to change.  One's life shouldn't be judged by what they own or how many likes to their new purchase get.  The old saying goes "that you can't take it with you when its your time to go."  We should help them to realize that now.  Teaching them that they shouldn't go into debt to buy something that looks good to others.  Balancing their income should help make them less materialistic, and maybe help mold a different world.
            Everyone loves to own things, but those things aren't what makes you.  Items can make your life easier.  We need to buy what is necessary not what looks the best or makes us look better to others.  People are going into debt all the time based on the materialism that exisits in society today.  It is getting out of control.  Stop and think before you go to buy something next time you shop, the change starts with you.
