Unfortunately, social media and mainstream "hollywood" all to well wreak havoc on individuals all over the world.  Individuals range from young kids, to adolecents, to young adults and beyond.  Images and impressions portrayed in these outlets get in the heads of people and suddenly they are brainwashed into believing they should act or dress or look like others shown.

This is not how I believe.  I will not allow an outlet or media platform to drive how I will live my life, or dress, or act.  I will take a stand for who I am, and behave how I feel is appropriate without seeing image and impressions being bestowed upon me.  I will be independant of those opinions.  My hope is that the najority of others will also.

I undertsnad that there will be those out there that will argur against my opinion.  That is fine.   I am open to hear any or all arguments about how impressions and images do not effect people.  However, it will take a lot of proof to convince me otherwise.  Every little girl aspires to be like Mylie Cyrus or Brittany Spears, or Christina Aguilara.  Every little boy aspires to be like the next and upcoming MLB player or NFL player or NBA player.  But, look at some of these individuals and the image and imressions they give off?  Not very inspiring or resposible from most of them.

In conclusion, I truly believe images and impressions have a more negative effect on people.  I believe an individual needs to be strong minded and even open minded to avoid mainstream media and social media brain washing tactics.  Thinking back to the time when I grew up, there was not much "competition" so-to-speak amongst people to look like, or act like, or be like others.
