Materialism oftentimes is frowned upon as immoral, or even viewed as a sin. It is said that the environment surrounding an individual is merely a reflection of their inner world�What about those who choose to hoard? There are many who cope through difficult life experiences by buying some items through online shopping. Is there truly a point in owning more objects if one cannot take them to their grave? For many, materialism is a means not only to an end but to happiness as well, but is the quest to own it all really worth the energy expended to do so?

There is a new phenomenon cropping up in digital circles, on TikTok, and being reported by major news outlets, called NFTs. NFTs or non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that can be tied to and owned by individuals. The new fad of jpeg monkeys worth more than the average person can afford in a year is only one example. Those who argue that NFTs have no utility, do not understand that there is much more to it than 'right click-save as' on these images. NFTs are a real-world use case for cryptocurrency, transparency in the blockchain, proof of ownership for intellectual property, and the appreciation for art. People have and continue to use these characters, whether apes or punks, as their online identities and to even open restaurants with them as their mascot or have them star in a production by the holder, the person who purchased the character.

Modern day materialism reflects more on individuality, than on the sheer quantity of the items owned. Recently there has been a shift between how a person's status is represented. What once was five houses owned is now five million followers watching a live stream of a particular person. Content creation has long dethroned the enjoyment of owning the physical item. Gen Z has their material sights on owning the experience.
