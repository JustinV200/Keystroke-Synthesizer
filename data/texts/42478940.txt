People can find happiness in a variety of different ways. Someone might find happiness in putting their child first above their own happiness. It's that moment when you see a smile on your child's face by doing even the simplest of things with them. This could mean that a person might not be a morning person or being tired from the previous day, but their child insists on waking up at 5am every morning. Someone who values their child's happiness above their own would want to get out of bed every morning with their child to start their day and spend time with their child. 

Another example would be that someone might find happiness in their journey to lose weight. As they start to see their body transform and change, they start to become more immersed in the process. In turn, they might have to make small sacrifices in order to achieve these goals. This could come in the form of choosing not to go out to eat with friends because the options might be too high in calorie. Or finding the time to prioritize work outs after a long day at work.

Happiness does not need to be an all or nothing. You can still maintain a sense of happiness by achieving your personal goals or aspirations, but also doing things that makes other people happy as well. To make this happen, you just need to find that balance in your life to make both of those things happen. Most people naturally can make both things happen. Others might need to put in the extra effort to do so.
