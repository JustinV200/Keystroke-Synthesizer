you achieve happiness by doing something that pleases you, may it be reaching personal goals or helping others in need, it all differs from person to person, peoples choice and definition for happiness has changed over the years but core requirement has always stayed the same, doing something that makes people a sense of pleasure.

We all like to reach our own personal goals, we all have personal goals set for us since the day we were born, and since then we have been trying to fulfill this duty, some find pleasure in this while others see it as a nuisance.

People also can find happiness by helping others prosper, this is a different kind of happiness, this kind of happiness is rare to have too, to be completely selfless and helping other all the while finding pleasure in it is a rare feeling indeed.

Whatever one finds happiness in is their own personal preferences, if someone finds pleasure in helping others they are more likely to be happy, while if someone finds happiness by reaching personal goals then they should be allowed to be happy, it doesn't mean being selfish, also it doesn't mean you should be selfish either, having a set rules of goals are more likely to be successful in the long run.
