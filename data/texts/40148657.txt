I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others over their own personal goals. I believe that in pursuing your own goal you find happiness in the pursuit and not the actual achievement. When we focus on others we are able to gain happiness from making other people happy.


Our society has transitioned to one of instant gratification with the emergence of social media. Everybody is searching for that next dopamine hit, spending a lot of time to achieve ones personal goals don't fulfill those desires and instead lead to creating new goals to achieve. Its similar to how people say money doesn't buy happiness, its just makes it easier. The instant gratification that comes from helping others is much easier and faster than the gratification that comes from achieving ones personal goal. 


Some people can say that they don't care about others and their only happiness comes from them achieving their own goals, but to them I say what happens when you achieve those goals. They are only one person and their goals are finite while helping others is infinite. By focusing on others you vastly expand your total happiness available because there are more people that you can make happy and in turn become happy yourself.
