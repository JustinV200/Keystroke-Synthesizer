I think cooperation is the key to success versus competition. I believe that cooperation is something that anyone can achieve and strive to do. People come from all different walks in life but cooperation is one of those things that everyone learns on how to do from being a small child all the way through adulthood. Competition isn't for everyone especially those who are shy, meek, nervous or have anxiety issues.

Cooperation is achieved by listening to your parents, teachers, coworkers and management. There is no point to being a competitive person in a work place since everyone is there for the same common purpose. Go to work, do well and come home. By cooperating by company guidelines or working with others in a team-oriented atmosphere, there is more success since there isn't that pressure to compete and win. I would rather cooperate, do my job right and well and leave as stressless as possible. Competition seems incredibly stressful and always have to be the best no matter what. 

Competition can become a volatile thing to deal with whether you are being competitive yourself or surrounded by competitive people, it can become a stressful thing to deal with. Competitiveness results nothing but stressful situations at work and with coworkers to get worked up over a little thing. I'm not in sports so why do I need to be competitive? What do I get out of it? More than likely, someone being mad that you win/didn't win for the team/for themselves which can then lead into a bad work situation and it can become toxic. 

Cooperation is good for those who are a lot more laid back and without the extra stress, the goals for the team/company will definitely be completed since you would be more clear headed.
