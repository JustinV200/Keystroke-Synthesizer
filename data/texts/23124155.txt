In current trends Materialistic play a main role, because every one want to live a luxiourious life. If you want to experience luxury in your life you must run back to materialistic. when I was a kid my parents offered me a healthy life thought healthy habits and natural resources. but now all my needs are changed because of this materialistic. 
I changed my behaviour because of my friends circle. They accept me only I am in the state of materialistic. from the people's point they are in the wrong trends to this younger age but from our point of we just want to update our life style.The highly materialistic people believe that owning the things are neccessary to achieve life goals. and they never believe in people values. In a extream level they lead their life only based on price tags.
if we try to change this people from materialistic to normal, they feel unwell to the society and it be a unacceptable part of their life change. overall I try to say materialistic in an acceptable level could be okay but it exceed this level means it becaom harmful to all. and this western society tend to pass on human values auch as kindness, equality.
