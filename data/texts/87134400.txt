Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic due to its effect on the environment and it's unfairness in society. Materialism robs the environment of it's natural resources, creates the rich vs poor mentality.

The population of the world has increased, creating less supply and more demand. The use of more resources to fill this demand causes strains on the environment. This creates a shortage in these supplies and eventually these resources will not be available. It is evident in the lack of supplies in stores as well as the amount of time it can take for stores to get these supplies back in stock. 

Greed affects society with the rich vs poor mentality. Society shows that the more money you have, the more you can buy even when there is less supply. For those who have less money this is not an option. Therefore, it creates an uneven distribution of goods for society as a whole. 

Modern society needs to realize that it doesn't matter how much you have, that it isn't about the status quo. It is about taking care of your environment, helping others. So, that when it is your time to leave this world, you can make it a better place for those that you leave behind.
