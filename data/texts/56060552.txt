Materialism is seen by society on a wide spectrum; it is a by-product of many decades of industrial and technological improvements in a society.  However, there are many concerns about the continued benefits of materialism especially in light of possible severe shortages and consequences in the future society.

History notes that people have always owned things; there have always been the haves and have nots whereby people who have the most material things and money are upper class and people who have less generally are seen as lower class.  The concern and perception in the modern technological society is that the upper class rich people have the power by owning more material goods than they know what to do with.  The well off have the luxury items such as expensive cars, yachts, houses and jewelry.  The lesser fortunate have less possessions and power.  The realization of man's contribution to climate change has brought forth many concerns. 

Modern society should be criticized for being overly materialistic because of the finite resources used as a by-product of consumption.   Also, the materialistic society is also a "throw-away" society as evidenced by filling landfills and addition to climate change produced by the gasses of consumed items such as electronic waste.   

Society needs to own material objects in a more responsible way by only using precious resources when needed; ie throwing away less and rehabilitating many of the material objects.  These steps may help to control climate change, decrease severe shortages and consequences in the future.
