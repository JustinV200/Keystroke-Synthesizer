People who cooperate can achieve more than those who compete against one another. Many competetive work environments do not do as well as cooperative work environments. I have worked in several work place enviornments that were not benefical in me accheiving due to the contstraints of my fellow coworkers. When you work in an envornment were their is no cooporation your effeciancy to perform well suffers as well as your mental well being. Success is crucial in a team that works well with one another, assists one another. "Team work makes the dream work" as they say.

I have found that I work the best when I work with a team that is able to assist me as well as if I am able to assist them. Team work is the foundation of a productive work space. Without teamwork we would not have a foundation for a successeful team. In situations where I have been left without coopreration from others I found it harder to acheive my goals. I worked in a gas sation where I was often left by myself to run three registers and maintain the building. It is impossible to do that without some form of cooperation.

This was something I saw every day in my work place. The lack of cooperation made for a hostile enviornment where I wasn't thriving. Coming home each day my mental health was also suffering. I was always exhausted both mentally and physically. It was only after I left that envinormnet did I realize how much cooperation attributed to my well being in the work place and out of the work place. Cooperation is the only way a business can truly thrive and be successful.
