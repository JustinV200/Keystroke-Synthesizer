Everyone has a different opinion on how a perfectly happy life would look life for them. Some people find realizing their own goals to be the key to their happiness, and others try to please others to find satisfaction. While there isn't a one-size-fit-all answer for individual happiness, I would argue that focusing on one's own goal would be the most effective way to bring happiness to both oneself and others.

When people focus on their own goals, they are usually more motivated to achieve the goal. When the goal brings direct value to a person, they are more likely to work hard to reach the result they want. If they succeed at the goal, they would feel proud of themselves on top of enjoying the fruit of their labor. Even if they failed, the disappointment would only affect themselves and they could always learn from the failure to improve the possibility of the success in the future.

One the other hand, when people prioritize their energy on pleasing others, they might never get the outcome they wanted. Investing time and resources on other people could be a luxury for regular people, and no one could guarantee whether the recipient of the kindness would be better off due to the investment. So, the disappointment could easily outweigh the anticipation of happiness.

It is still possible for people to feel happiness for helping and pleasing others. However, I would argue that most people would only find that type of happiness after they satisfy their own needs. Otherwise, the effort they spent on others could make them regret not investing on themselves in the future - unless the cause would eventually benefit themselves as well.

Happiness is personal and could be achieved with many different paths. In the end, everyone should do what feels the best for themselves.
