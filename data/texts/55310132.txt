          What is happiness? Is it being glad, being content, having joy, feeling loved, or loving someone else? It could be all of these things. It could be non of these things. It is what makes each of us feel that the world is good. Happiness comes from within and it comes from where deep within each of us. Happiness can be brought on by our focus. Happiness can be direct and sourced from focusing on ourselfs. Happiness can also be indirect and sourced from focusing on others. Which source will bring the most people the most happiness? 
            The argument is strong for the case that happiness is surley to be gained by centering your energy and thoughts on the happiness of those around you. I believe that positive energy brings and invites more positive energy. Thus in the same way more happiness will bring more happiness. 
             Have you ever been in a crowd in a stadium watching a sports game? If you have I am certain you understand what is ment by "you can taste the excitment in the air". This is the basis for how I know that when happiness is brought to those around you, it is automatically also brought to you. I know this when a baby giggles, next time you get to see or hear it, take a moment and look around, you won't find a face without some degree of smile on it. 
              I do understand the other side of the coin, that there are those who would believe that the happiness you earn for yourself will make you happier. There is a case for that also  because it does feel good to accomplish your goals. It is also maybe a quicker way of recieving a happiness fix, if you will, because it is more within your control and relient on others. Those are valid points but in the the end I dont think it is as sustainable or powerful as the happiness we feel when observed in others. I believe no matter how good you can feel by concentrating on your own self happine
