I believe that the competition was one of the main reason for personal success. It's between the two thoughts of the people confidence and the peole cooperation on the work or play. It seems to be that it differs a lot in the complex world. This both differs snd depends upon the mentality of the person involved in the victory.

To me it seems that the confidence of the person is little most important in the play, because it gives them the high level support for their victory. More over the individual confidence for a person is more motivative for them to attain their victory. It's an bigger suport for them which others cannot give them.

Other than that the cooperation given by the person to the play seems to be somewhat supportive. It looks like that that efforts of the persons is literally encouraged up. It's an mental support given by the extrenal person motivates to get the victory.

Considering the both scenarios, The most confidence, power gives the way the success for the person, Since the cooperation of the other person give som motivation to get through the victory. So concluding the scenario, The physical wealth and the mental motivation leads to the best victories.
