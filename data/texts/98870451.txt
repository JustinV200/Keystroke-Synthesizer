As human beings, we often tend to get attracted by the colorful things around us.  As we are persons of six senses, those magical colors gives us a vibe while seeing it.  This is the same in case of advertisements too.  Companies intend to promote their brands in a realistic way and so they chose this sort of advertising things even if it is not real.  Today's world prefers and pays attention to things which seems showy and boasting rather than things which are real and naturalistic.

For example, in a soap ad, we see that foam comes up as soon as we sprinkle water over it.  That even vanishes the stain in a second too.  This scenario rarely happens when it comes to a real life.  Even if we submerge soap for an hour, it will not form foam and it won't be removing stain too as shown in the advertisement.  And there the purpose of the soap fails.  At that point we feel sorry for ourself for being aware of the differenes between real and unreal things often shown in the advertisements.

From this it can be clearly seen that people always admire for the things which are fake and unreal without researching on things to such an extent.  We cannot blame companies for advertising and promoting such fake things.  Because it is their tactics to do so.  We people is the one who is wholly responsible  for falling prey to such kind of things.  We should be aware while buying such kind of things and we are the who is wholly responsible for the money that we had paid.
