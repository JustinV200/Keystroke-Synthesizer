 First of all I would like to thanks for giving me the oppurtunity to express my thoughts. Now let us go into the point.
 
       In my point of view " Happiness is the ultimate goal and it was the key to the success ". So happiness to someone is their own perceptive whether it comes from their own acheivement or by helping others but according to me it was real happiness when someone goal was acheived by us or by our help. At that time not only my goal as well their goal was acheived . It gives so much more happiness .Let me explain you with the simple example.

      Let us take a look into the life of two students where one is the topper and another one is who wants to complete his study as he needs that more for future but not able to understand anything.at that point the topper students focus on his or her studies and also helps the another one by teaching him everything and also explains the concept in the simple way which helpd the another student to score goods which was their ultimate goal.


   From the above story the first one scores good mark which gives hin happiness and the most happiness comes when the another also acheives good marks. So in point of view the real hapiness comes if they focus on their goal also some one's happiness. Whatever the suitation is be happy and make others happy and help others.

Thank you once again for the oppurtunity. Have a great reading time and wonderful time ahead.
