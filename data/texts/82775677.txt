       First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to express my point of view on the given topic. 

     So when it comes to the expression without any second thought our mind goes to " First impression is the best impression " . We give so much importance to the things and people who have the best images and as well as the apperance. People like public figures and politicians and also cetain celebrity mainly focuses on the image so that they can reach ceratain height and good level of popularity.

   In my point of view it is correct and also important to focus on the image so that we can gain popularity. For an example for an politician he or she should have to maintain the good image amoung the public by serving the people who were in the need and also help so of the charity organisation. So that they can reach people heart and stay there forever.

    But those image which are created shouls be real and it not only for the showcase. they have to be true to their people as well as themself. They also does not show fake image and does not create bad impression just for the money. Some just doing it for money is the unwanted one.

Thank you once again for giving me the oppurtunity to express my thoughts
