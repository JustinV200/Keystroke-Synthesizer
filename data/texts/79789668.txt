Modern society should be critisized for being too materialistic. This country that we live in is based on shopping and spending money. That is what our fourfathers put together all those years ago. It was what united the masses an stopped the wars. Every human poses the will to be greedy and it is what has driven coutless wars. I want that so I will take it. This should not happen in modern society. However, our governements are the ones that need to start changing from the top of the pyrimid. 

If humans were not greedy they would not constanly buy things. If people were not buying things then people would have money. If poeple had money then they would get off of government assistance. If no one was on government assistance, except for those that truly need it, then the governement would have more money. If the governement would have more money then the the country would be richer and the taxes could be reduced. If the taxes are reduced then everyone in this country would have more money. If everyone has more money, then they can save it until it's needed. 

In conclusion, humans desire more of everything. It doesn't need to be this way. All it takes is not to buy something and you'll save money. Saving money is a great thing that most people cannot do. They complain about it way too much. Save enough money and you will change your stars. You can better your life if you change your stars.
