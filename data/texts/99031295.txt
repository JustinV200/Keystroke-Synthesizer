I like to sit and think about what make's people so happy all the time. When I go out shopping or even to the doctor's office I see people happy and just smiling away. Is it a personal goal they have for themself or is it what they do for other's that bring's them joy?  I think for myself bringing joy to other's makes me happy, just seeing them smile brighten's my day.
I don't know why seeing someone so happy can make my worse day turn into one of the best day's ever but it does. Scientist claim that giving a present or doing something nice for someone can release oxytocin, which is a hormone and gives you that warm feeling, euphoria, and a strong connection to other's. Giving or simply being nice to someone can be a win-win for both side's, so maybe that's why I love doing it so much.
I know a lot of people that set goal's like getting a better job, making more money, or buying their dream car. And although these thing's will make you happy for awhile that happiness is short lived and you will have to set bigger and better goals for yourself that can take year's to accomplish. These goal's will only bring you short-term happiness unlike just being nice to someone or giving them a small gift, thing's you can look back on and remember forever. Seeing and making other people happy is something you can do everyday as much as you want and it will make you a better and much happier person in the long run. 
So tommorow think of different way's to be nice to people, and remember, money can't buy your happiness, happiness is free.
