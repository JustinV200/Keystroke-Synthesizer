          Teamwork is a value that is vital to moving the team and all players into success. But how do you get individuals to do their very best in order to meet the goal of success? Would cooperation catapult the team forward or will healthy competition? Healthy Competition is what pushes individuals to give their best. When everyone is giving their best, the entire team can move toward success.

          Cooperation asks that each team member works along side another and get the job done and well. It's a simple request, assuming there are little to no issues as far as communication, understanding of roles, etc. Simply asking for cooperation, in a way, is asking for each memeber of the team to give at least their bare minimal effort. But imagine what happens when competition is added to the mix.

         Competition calls for a person to dig deep and find the best of what they have to give. Just getting by is not enough. A bit of healthy competition demands that the team member stay on their toes. The collective goal is success. Most people want to earn rewards and be proud of the work that they did to recieve that reward. This is why many teachers have cards for flipping when a child misbehaves in class. Everyone has the collective goal to not flip a card and go home on green. While in the workplace, competition may have to be brought to the forefront through reviews in monthly or annual meetings, raises and bonuses, or even visual numbers of sales and growth.

         There are multiple ways to reach sucess. For each individual and/or team it will be different. But healthy competition thrown into the mix helps to pull the very best out of team members and also helps to push the team, collectively towards success.
