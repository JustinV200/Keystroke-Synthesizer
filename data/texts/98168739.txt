People are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others rather than their own personal goals. There are several reasons I believe this including: other people in your life being happy will in turn make you happy, if everybody was more worried about the happiness of others than eventually all humans would be happy, and although personal goals are important, I think that being a positive influence in other peoples lives in even more important.

The reason other peoples happiness will in turn make you happy is because humans are social creatures. If everyone around you is happy than it will naturally rub off on you and you'll become happy as well. Currently I think that most people are focused on their personal goals rather than the happiness of others and there is a lot of unhappy people in this world. Only focusing on your personal goals instead might lead to reaching more goals such as early retirement, a bigger house etc., but if you achieve all of that have nobody to share it with, I don't think you will end up being very happy. 

So in conclusion, I believe that focusing on your personal goals is definitely a great idea, but ultimately I still believe that people are more likely to be happy themselves if they focus on the happiness of others instead.
