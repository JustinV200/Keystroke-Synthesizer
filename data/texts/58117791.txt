People are selfish these days, they are focusing on their personal growth only. They don't have time to think about others. Even if they have time for others, they are not ready to spend it for others. They don't care about other's lives, sometimes even if they see someone infront of them struggling with something, they are not ready to give them a helping hand.

If someone near them get attacked by others, they are not even caring about it. They are simply moving away from the place without worrying about others. They are trying to keep them safe and putting themselves inside the safe zone. The only people they care about is their close ones. They live for their own personal growth only.

They don't even know whether the other people are happy or sad. They are filled with their own goals and are running behind them. People are of different types and they are filled with similiar goals sometimes and sometimes with different goals. But all are with the same mentality which is about avoing others and caring about themselves. So, in all these years what I understood is, people are happy with their personal growths and not with the happiness of others.
