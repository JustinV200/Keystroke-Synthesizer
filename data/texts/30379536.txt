Nothing can make a person happier than achieving a goal they have set for themselves. This is not to say that a goal cannot change or even be dropped along the way. One may also pursue a goal for reasons unrelated to achieving happiness, for instance to improve one's financial situation. But happiness is definitely a by product of success. 

Some may argue that improving the lives of others is the ultimate road to happiness. But I would say that chosing to help others is therefore their personal "goal". And that brings me back to my statement that achieving a goal is the best route to happiness. Likewise, being non judgemental about the pursuits of others is also a good way to ensure your own happiness.  

In conclusion, whether you pursue specific personal goals, or goals of a humanitarian nature you are still aiming at a target that will bring you happiness. So perhaps the best way to be happy is just to pursue something. Don't sit around contemplating your naval, get active. Happiness is proactive. It can be a matter of choosing your attitude. So don't worry, be happy!
