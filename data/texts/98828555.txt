Happiness is a tricky beast.  Many people send their lives searching for tracks and clues on where to find it.  There are plenty of products out there that promise happiness to the person who buys it.  In the end, some find it, and some don't.  Personally, I think happiness is more easily found by focusing on personal goals, rather than fostering the happiness of others.

One reason that I think personal goals are a better route to happiness is that people are self-centered, in general.  For example, during the pandemic, people railed against wearing a face mask.  There were studies out there that suggested masks aren't very effective at protecting yourself from Covid-19.  Masks gain most of their benefit from another person wearing them.  The result was that people didn't care about other people getting sick.

Another event backing this up hails from a few decades ago.  The president of the time asked for all Americans to chip in and sacrifice a little.  The one I specifically remember was keeping the thermostat a little colder during the winter.  This was not well-received.  In the end, the president lost their reelection bid.

Beyond self-centeredness, keeping an eye on personal goals gives something more concrete for people to focus on.  "The happiness of others" is a very unquantified gray area.  How much happiness for others is enough to feel happy yourself?  There's never a shortage of people that need help.  It becomes all too easy to think you aren't doing enough.  This can lead to giving more of yourself than is healthy.

Now, having said all of this, I do recognize that people can and do find happiness by focusing on others.  Some people are wired to feel rewarded more from this behavior than others.  For them, that may be their best path.  However, I feel like the number of people that are like that are not anywhere close to the majority.  I base that off of politics.  Many people hate giving things to others that they didn't "deserve".
