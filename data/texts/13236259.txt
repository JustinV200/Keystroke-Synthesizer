These are the ways that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. We should not have to pay more for fancy packaging. People put way too much time and effort into appearance. They care too much about what others think of them. It's unhealthy and selfish. 

It is morally wrong that the media, entertainers, and other elite try to tell us what the real world is. They tell us what is cool. Who are they to say so? They don't know what it is like for the average person. 

When people are so consumed in their appearance and material things, they are living in a fantasy land. They don't know what it's like living in the real world. They miss out on what is truly important in life. They may just think they are keeping up with the latest trends, but there is an entire world outside of their bubbles. 

I recommend that everyone take a break from social media and spend a little time reconnecting with mother nature. Imagine some peace without all the gossip and ads telling us what is cool and what to think. You can refocus that energy into what really matters.
