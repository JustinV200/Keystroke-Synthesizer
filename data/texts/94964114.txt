This country is based on consumerism. We save money, hunt for bargains, borrow money, and look for deals. These activities keep us gainfully employed. It gets the creative juices flowing. It raises people up from poverty or the lower classes. It is a patriotic thing to do to support our economy.

When we become old enough to make some money, we want to spend it. Some cash to services and some cash to goods. If we put most of our money in the bank it would not benefit anyone , including ourselves because we can't experience new things, taste something different, improve our health, or get an education. A strong US economy is a form of security in the international world. 

This is a capitalistic society. There has to be earning and spending, at least for the basics like shelter, food and clothing. I am helping myself when I buy, but there is the garment worker, the profession althlete, the construction worker, and every other profession or job description. Government services are essential. How would social services, first responders and  armed services function if we did not earn, spend and get taxed, sometimes multiple times? Some may not own stocks, but the benefits of a strongly trading economy is for all.

Of course, consumerism can get out of hand with excess becoming more normal. But spending can also be used for charities and to level the inequalities that exist. It is now common to round up to the nearest dollar or to donate a small amount when making a purchase at a store. Online, we can name an organization that will benefit when we shop on the Internet.  This giving is relatively painless and adds up to make a big difference. Actually, giving is a form of liberal materialism. Everybody wants to be a philantropist.

Therefore, do your part for the economy. Spend, and help others have what you want for yourself.
