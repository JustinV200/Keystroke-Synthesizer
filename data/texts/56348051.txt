It is quite clear that since the onset of the industrial age, and probably well before it, materialism has been, and continues to be, an enormously popular pursuit. 
Materialism is the acquisition of "stuff," and it's done to fulfill needs and desires, those  of ourselves and others. Because needs must be met, materialism of this sort is naturally understandable. However, most people generally recognize the impulsive and frequent pursuit of unnecessary material goods to be a vice of sorts, and with good reason.

In these modern times, a good example of extreme materialism would be those individuals who have developed an unhealthy attachment to the pursuit of "stuff," for the sake of owning "stuff." Being addicted to shopping, like any addiction, negatively impacts the addict's life. A person afflicted with the compulsion to go on one shopping spree after another can find themselves deep in debt, and unable to meet other necessary financial obligations. Most people suffering from this type of materialism find themselves unable to curb their insatiable need to get the "rush" and exhilaration they experience when toting fistfuls of bags of new purchases from a shopping center. Unfortunately, these individuals seem to be attempting to fulfill a need that materialism will never be able to satisfy.

Materialism is a vice. Some might argue that materialism is necessary, which is true when pursuing needs. But for fulfilling wants, it must be viewed prudently. Otherwise it can lead to negative ends.  Vigilance!
