The world today is pulling people in every direction, seemingly all at once. From what you eat, to how you spend your time, to what you wear, corporations are vying for your attention. To do this, they try to create the most appealing and interesting products, for nothing else but to earn your money. The use of clever advertising and colorful and bright boxes is a way for them to get your attention, and eventually your hard-earned money. But in reality, the product that you end up with is not all it was cracked up to be. This false sense of awe and wonder gives way to the harsher truth: that companies will do whatever they can to get your money, and the paths they take to get there are not always altruistic.

Appearance and image are considered all too important in today's world. What people really want is the truth, no matter how watered-down it may be. If a company actually told the truth in their advertising, I for one would be much more inclined to buy their product. But the fact is, truth is not what sells to the masses. Everyone wants to look the best, or be the next movie star, even when that is not possible. Companies know this, but do not care. That is why we need to bring the truth back to our image of life.

When people say that this image alteration is actually a good thing, I scoff. It is never a good thing to mislead people, and that is exactly what is happening. However you want to spin it, impressions and what society think of you are irrelevant. All that matters is how you view yourself and your life. Because at the end of the day, that is all you have. YOUR life.
