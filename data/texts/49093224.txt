Ironically, cooperation and competition have been rivals with one another since the dawn of time. One can argue that cooperation, although the more behaviorally desired and mature of the two, is not the driver of success in the Western world. It is important to make the distinction of where success is acheived, as not all civilizations operated under the capitalist model, which is a significant reason why competition has reigned in the West. However, it can be argued that both are equally important in a complex world.

Due to a capitalist economy, cooperation has taken a back seat to competition, allowing huge corporations and business tycoons to be pitted against each other in financial, legal, and technological arenas. In other areas such as team sports, cooperation and competition work together. Football and soccer teams act as one body, each teammate cooperating with one another to beat the other in a competition and win the game. In an academic arena the lines are blurred, although one researcher may be responsible for a breakthrough, they are helped by the institutions financing their programs and the other researchers under their wing. Cooperation is key in these arenas, however competition to receive funds and grants is also present.

It really depends on the arena, the person, the goal, and even the place. A spelling bee requires competition to win. An Olynpic race is a competition. Wall Street bids are competition, as is most of the economy. Cooperation is required in all team sports, research, and work environments.  It is important to remember that both cooperation and competition have their place in this world, and it is unnecessary to make the distinction that either is more or less important, rather they are equally necessary to achieve success.
