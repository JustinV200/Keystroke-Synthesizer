We humans have been trying to improve our lives since the beginnings of the human kind and obtaining material things was one of the source that has evolved throughout the ages to lure us into an idea of fullfillness and joy but the question is where do we draw the line and save ourself and our planet.
We cause ourselves mental and physical damages in the long run by spending our hard eraned money into objects that we think have value and most of the time it's to please and impress people we don't care about or maybe is that society has set the standards so high that we must have the need to acquire more and more and that's a chain reaction to other feelings within us.
Our well being is not the only thing that's effected by that and that's not the main issue, the real problem is what the humankind is doing to our planet and the constant extraction of fossil fuels and minerals is going to have a terrible affect on our planet and we are starting to see these results. 

We can already see the changes in our climate and the devastating floods in certain areas while on the other side of the map there are major droughts.
Coorporates / large companies are responsible and the government should do a better job at holding them accountable.
