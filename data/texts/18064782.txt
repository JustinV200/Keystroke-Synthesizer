Do what people see and percieve have more impact on them than what is really true? How much of what we see and view really has an effect on us?  

For example, a beautiful wrapped present may have the most ugly gift inside.  If people had to chose a gift, some would pick the one that is most beautifully wrapped, thinking the gift inside would be the best.  When in fact, it may not be.    The same may be true for other things we see and percieve in our lives.

When I think of the current political season in our coutry and the upcoming elections in November, I am reminded of this concept.  Some of the most elequently speaking politicians and those who are handsom or beautiful, may not carry or send a message on issues facing our country today that are true.  I think we as American people owe it to ourselves and our country to check the facts on what they say before we make up our mind to vote for them.  I have realized this year that some politicians will say whatever they want, even if they know it is not true, to get the American peope to vote for them.  And, unless we as Americans check and double check the facts, we may be decieved and vote for them.  Some politicians say one thing while campaigning, but do the very opposite when they get elected into office.  If we voted for them, and realize what kind of person they are later, then it is too late to change our vote and we have to deal with the consequences until the next elections.

In conculsion, we should be very observant when listening to politicians speeches and and check the facts about they are telling us before we decide to vote for them.
