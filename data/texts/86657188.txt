I agree that now a days people starts judge only for appearance this is not good for mental health. because everyone live the life without knowing the story. If you asked product quality is important not content. so dont believe and buy the content. media job is develop the product and reach the public and develop the own but that is not real. reality is more important than any other thing so if you want or need anything you must go and watch the product.
Sometimes people will put more effort to promote the product. because this is the way reach to everyone. some people only purchase the product watched the advertisement. this is not everytime worth so be careful what you want to purchase. most of people ready to cheated so we are more awareness to buy the product.
This is the one thing i want to share you guys i am always buy the product go to shop. sometimes only buy the product to see the add but not everytime this is happened. never judge buy other opinions. social media is just entertainment so be careful. my friend affected most of the time now only she realize the truth about product.
