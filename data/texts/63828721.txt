What is happiness? It ias subject to the person who is defining it, because everyone has different things that make them happy. There are essentially two schools of though about where someone can devire their happiness, focusing on others or foscusing on oneself. I am going to explore both of these arguments in this eassy to see which one comes out on top. 

When one focuses on others they say that is alturuistic. Altruisim can lead to happiness. Think about how good it feels when you give a love one a special gift you picked out for them. Or how about the smiling face of someone you just offered to help? Doesn't that make you feel good inside. The question is how long lasting and conributing is focusing on other essential to your long-term happiness. On the other hand if you focus on yourself and what makes you happy, then you have time to give to others. It is kind of like the airplace air mask debate. You cannot help others until you put the mask on yourself. Therefore the argument can be made that in order to make others happy you muct be happy with yourself. 

I am going to make the argument that true happiness comes from focusing on yourself. I know that seems selfish, but as a mom I know this to be true. For the first 6 years of being a mom, I forgot myself and only focused on my kids. When I finally decided to pul back and focus on myself more, I was a better mom to my kids and I was happier. We need to know our needs and happiness is a priority and then we can share that with others. 


In conclusion, while there are several ways to achieve happiness in this  life, I think the most successful way is to focus on oneself.
