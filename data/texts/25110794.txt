Happiness has been something that we as humans have strived for since we've developed the ability to walk. Life can be diminished to the pursuit of happiness and fufilment. There has been a rise in therapy sessions and self-help products because we as humans continue to search for happiness in a technologic and hectic world. Happiness is only found within ourselves and it is with self-fufilment that we can help others feel their own happiness as well. 
It can be said that someone who is not happy with themselves spreads their sadness and unhappiness to others. It may not be on purpose but it is as if unhappiness spreads through their actions and words even in the advice they are giving. Someone who is unhappy will see the world through a hazy lens and speak on the world that they see. It can be a world where everyone's worst side is the side that they see. The world is gray and no one is there for one another-- there is no bright side to this world or to their situations. Whereas someone who is fufilled and happy may be able to acknowledge that the world is not always perfect or pleasant, but can speak to the hopefullness of the situation. They can show others what the brightside looks like and even be realistic with them. How can someone help others when they cannot fully help themselves? 
While there are situations where someone may find happiness while helping others; I do not believe that can be the case for everyone. There is a sense of accomplishment when helping others but that cannot stay if we do not continue to help ourselves on our own. By being able to do that we can teach and help others around us and that will continue to grow and grow.
In order to feel fufilled and happy you need to focus on your own happiness so it is able to be spread to those around you.
