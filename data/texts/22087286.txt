People has their own way of achieving success. Everyone has their own unique prespective on solving problems. Some can achieve greatness by doing things in intense competition while others believe themselves to be a team player. Thus we get the question on which is more effective among competition or cooperation.

We can observe the path of progression of our world and we can see that we have made huge inventions while competing with others. The current powerhouses of the modern world were  always competing with each other on how to progress their civilization faster than the others, thus they became what they are now. On the other hand even after the intense rivalry many other countries have tried cooperating and have gained huge results too. Cooperating means to help others while receiving help from them, it is a harmonious system of coexistence and while trying to achieve something great. Which has also shown some great results. When a group of people cooperate with each other in to doing something a lot of knowledge and experience is put together in one place, all for one single goal, all working for one single goal. It is truely an amazing vision. If people truely Cooperate with each other i believe we can achieve more rather than just competing with others.

While competing can bring out the best in people but cooperation has much better value for those join. So in conclusion I want to say that people can gain more by cooperating.
