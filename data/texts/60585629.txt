The question asked whether images and impressions have too much effect on people i would say definetely yes because everybody heard term called first impression which is based on peopole characters on first time we encounter with the people, but according to human current knowledge nobody would accept that fact.

everyone rate the human we meet at first on images and impressions they make instead of the character their physical appearance make an pivot role in it, the great example you could take the advertisment industry which is based on first look and impression make about the product on peoples mind, and film industry which is sole based on impressions and images which is an apt example for this topic, and there is no actual evidence on exampling the politicans industry, but i would say political industry is also comes under this category.

the only solution to this problem we need to change peopole mind psycholigical instead of seeing other people phsyical appearance you must see their mind, character and ideas of thoughts how they precive the world, which mean i am not saying everyone must became mind reader, we must train our mind like that, at final my words is "99% people rate people using there images and impressions".
