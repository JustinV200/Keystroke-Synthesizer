In today's society, children may find it difficult to concentrate without the materialistic objects that their parents buy them. For example, parents give their small children their own smartphone, tablet, computer, etc. At such a young age, they will feel like they need to have it.

Materialism is in our daily lives. We try hard to avoid it, but it is not so easy to do so. There are commercials/ads for things we did not even know we wanted, but feel like we need it. That hot new toy that a kid sees on television, new furniture, vehicles, and more candles than you know what to do with. You just know they look and smell nice. 

A ploy that brings people in to be more materialistic are sales, coupons, and deals. When a store gives people coupons, or have sales up to fifty or seventy percent off, it brings people in to buy more things than they need. This gives businesses more income, and their customers with less money and less space in their home than they had before going into that store.

In conclusion, modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Though, we should limit our materialistic behaviors. Instead of the want, we should be thinking more about the need. So, next time we go to the store, we should be asking ourselves, "what do we need?" Although, sometimes it is okay to indulge every now and again.
