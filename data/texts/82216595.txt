  Materialism is fact of life itself. If it were not for materialism, where would we be in civilization today? Society progresses because people want something more, something better than what they have presently. This gives us a motivation to succeed and improve our world that brought us out of the caves and into modern world. We take higher education to learn skills that will allow us to earn better living.

  I do not see a need to specifically criticize being materialistic although consideration needs to be given to the consequences of our actions, it's not a black or white answer. A person who indulges themself with a luxury car, a large home, vacations, etc is not bad for having or wanting those things if they are earned honestly. I worked to earn what I have. What a person works for, they deserve fully in my opinion. The thief is certainly materialistic but in a negative, criminal manner. I certainly see thieves as deserving of derision and punishment however the majority of us are not thieves! Savings accounts teach children the importance of setting a goal and putting effort towards it to obtain something they want in the future. 

  Use the desires for material things to motivate yourself but don't let it rule your life. Goals are good and we get great satisfaction when we meet them. Respect others, the world does not begin and end with yourself. Some people will say materialism brings greed and jealousy but that is skewed by some people's own human failings. Don't be jealous of what someone else has but use it as a way to plan how you will attain your own!
