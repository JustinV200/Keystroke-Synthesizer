     Happiness is one of life's greatest feelings. Its uplifting, energizing and inspiring. Happiness can be found in many things, and many choose to make thier own happiness with their own actions. Some experience happiness by accomplishing a personal goal, while others feel happy when those around them feel the same. While both actions lead to good vibes, does one lead to an overall 'happier' feeling?
     To that question I say yes, one does lead to a happier feeling, and to me that is the experience of accomplishing a personal goal. With your own personal goals, you know what you want to achieve, as well as the steps you must take to get there. Every small step is a small victory, a boost of confidence and a small feeling of the overall joy that is to come. Even when plans fall apart, you can remember the smaller victories you had and the happiness that came from them to keep your spirits up.
     While those who focus on the happiness of others can still be happy, there's a lot more risk involved. Relying on others' feelings to uplift your own spirits can backfire. Poeple can have bad days, things break or fail, and some days are just grey. If you rely on others for your happiness and they don't deliver, then you are left with nothing but unpleasant emotions.
     Overall happines can be found in many things, including personal goals and the happiness of those around us. And while both actions can lead to overall happiness, relying on your own goals to boost your emotions is a less-risky and overall happier was to live.
