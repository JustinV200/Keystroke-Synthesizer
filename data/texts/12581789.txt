Some peoples are running towards money making and achievement in life rather than giving  time to peoples who around them. It makes them materialistic in front of their friend and family circle. Many peoples got criticized from being more materialistic. But, there is a reason behind them who they are materialistic.
I have one friend named adam struggled a lot in his teenage life. He got scolded and ignored by many peoples who arounf him. It's all because of his poor life without any success. Then he realize that he could achive his graduation and had to make more money to gain his respect from the peoples who ignored him. He worked as an assistant staff at the cafeteria during an evening time of college to earn some money for his studies. In that mean time, he studied in the college at morning and done his assignments during mid night. After years surpassed now he is working as a Deputy Manager at a Bank. Now many peoples respects him because of his current position.
So I realized that peoples got respected, because of their materialistic life which is lead to their own success and create their own successful life. I agree that, many peoples criticized the persons who is more materialistic. But, they are the persons who achieved a lot in their success. So being a materialistic person would not wrong.
