Hi all,

I am Daysha and I am here to give you some thoughts on the topic of "are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goal or on the happines of others"

 One to be happier should focus on self so you can focus on others.  If you don't start with you, your accentunation on others will be spoiled by destitution, nervousness towards excusal, show, flatering, obligaton, despire, shock cruelty, disquite, oversharing, scorn, a hankering to contrl and as frequently as conceivable tendency overlooked, dismisssed and discarded.

Ecstasy potentially finds when one discovers a feeling of satisfaction with oneself.  to discover a feeling of happiness with oneself, you should recognize what you are, to work on your own damn self.  one ought to be content with at all he has, and everything starts from inside you.  if you are not satisfied with what you are, how could it be that you could anytime anticipate that someone else should recognize as you are and love you and be happy with you?   The delight you are glancing through encompassig you, is all inside you.

Generally speaking, since you should be more euphoric and search for it in things you see, tasted, feel and needed for it, the idea is to focus on yourself, you search happiness subsequently expecting you find something that addressed you and you understand that you will be happy if you guaranteed that thing, you will do a couple of exercises, even think about an arrangement, just get it and feel more upbeat acknowledging you were viable getting it.

If you focus on your persoal goals, you will grow in your life with that experience you can help others to acheive without difficulties.
