I am a member of the baby boom generation. I was born at the tail end of the baby boom. I grew up with television and then social media swaying public opinion based on visual impressions and looks. My life has been shaped by an awareness of advertising and visual cues.

As the country has changed the way we receive information from newspapers to television news to the internet, it has become increasing difficult for most people to discern credible sources.
We have now had generations of women that have been air brushed and photo shopped. Women are trying to live up to body expectations that are impossible. The pictures are faked. 
Public figures hire publicists to make sure that they are " branded " properly so that they are not publicly "cancelled" should they offend a huge amount of the country by making an off script statement.
The public figures cannot truly present their on thoughts but must present an acceptable "image" via social media.  

I am even more aware of the false or fake presentation of celebrities due to the fact that my son was in NYC working on movies and televison shows. He met so many celebrities. Many people were totally different than their public images. Rather than light hearted and funny, there were elitist and demanding. It is disappointing but a reminder that what is seen on instagram in not "real life". This is the also true for many products that we buy. The commercials and sponsorships on social media are not real testimonials. They are paid for advertising. 

All of this must be kept in mind to be both good consumers but also good voters. We have to see through the gloss and shine of social media, television, and advertising. We must be discerning and careful to make good and sound judgements in purchases as well as voting. Our future and our future generation will depend on decision based on fact and not false impressions.
