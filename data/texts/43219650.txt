Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?
     I'm going to explore the effect that advertisements and social media have on people, and why I believe people are being brainwashed into believing what they see in advertising and social media is the truth rather than propaganda. 
     Advertisements draw your attention by showing visuals of colorful packaging without actually stating the facts about the contents. The content may be much less than what you are led to believe, while you may be less likely to read the fine print and buy based on the ad. Social media uses influencers to demonstrate their products who are paid to tell you how wonderful the products are, which may or may not be true. But you purchase based on their comments rather than reality. Polititians tell us what they think we want to hear and we overlook whether they can actually follow through on their promises.
     Many people claim that advertising and social media influencers do not influence their decisions, rather they have a mind of their own. They say that they are not stupid enough to buy into propaganda and can distinguish between truth and fake. But statistics will prove that advertising  increases sales for the targeted product or service and people want to be like the influencers so they buy what the influencers are using or demonstrating. And do we not vote for the most charming, best looking, most convincing politician?
     We are most definitely affected by images and impressions, and I strongly believe those images and impressions are having way too much effect on people in today's world. I just don't know how we can re-program ourselves to determine reality from fantasy before making final purchasing or voting decisions.
