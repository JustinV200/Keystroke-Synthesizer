actually  it  not same  for  allthe  people . as  much  as  i understand  it  is  depend  on  people  mmood  and also those  peole mentality. 
there have  lots  of  condition  of  human  mentality . if  anyone is under only his carrear then  he  wil be  happy  in this  condition. but  if  someone want to  help  other  peopl , that  guy  is  not  only  follow  his  succes, this  kind  of people will be happy with  small thing .
so  that  i think  happiness depend  on differnt situation and differnet  mentality  people .  but  i  think  about those  people  who  only  follow  their  succes and also their  happiness they  will not  happy  at the  end of the day. Because there have no  limit of human demand. so no  one  can fullfill their demand. in this section  no  one  willhappy  ever . but  if anyone is try to  make happ  other  person with also careful about own goal , ultimetly  his own goal will not  raise in sky , so it  will be ver  easy to  share  happiness. 
If we care or observe to  our circle we can easyly match this . nowadasy most  of the people are try to get  their  own goal, for this the result is they are not  happy  . but  if they try to  help other and make other  happy  they will be happy  at the end of the day.
