People learn and achieve in different ways for each person.  Due to the complex experiences and genetic makeup - everyone has a unique style of learning and/or achieving.  Which method is best for an individual is determined most through trail and error.

As a teacher, I would purposely setup learning experiences where each individual could find a way to succeed.  I would observe where an individual's strenght and/or weaknesses where.  I would then try to introduce an experience that would produce a prositive outcome.  I myself am an auditory leaning learning.  I can learn and respond more to auditory instruction than visually sitmuli.  But, I always keep in mind that this is NOT the case for everyone.  If you uses competition as a stimuli - there will always be a winner - and a loser!  How does the winner feel?  Pride?  How does the loser feel?  Dejection?  So to a void the obvious in setting up a learning experience one must considerder these implications and outcomes.  Cooperative learning produces a more communial learning or sharing procees - so everyone would have contributed to the desired outcome - with any one being a clear winner - or loser.

In reality (owing to survival). early humans probably achieve most by competitive behavior - especially in the selection of a mate.  But as societies developed people began to learn that collectively working together that more could achieved and shared for the better good.  This is abundantly clear in political societies.  But one method cannot is not the best method - a hybird of both competition and cooperation is nessary for the overal benefit of everyone!
