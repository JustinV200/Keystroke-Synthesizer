In this modern world there are two ways to achieve success one is by competition and another one way is cooperating others idea. Many people prefers or promotes competition as the best way to achieve the success . But that is not only the way to taste the success I prefer cooperation method because that is the most powerful way to achieve success. Hard work or engaging in a same work or ideals helps to avoid failure to achieve important victories. Many of the people can not able to accept the cooperative method they only congratulate the peoples who win their idea by competition method. Now a days many people ready to work in a group and they work for a idelogy of a indivual person and then make that idea to lead a victory world. In this competion world we must work as a group to avoid failures. I recommend peoples to don't discourage people who are all win thier life by cooperating others idea . That is not a worst way but many people think like that. I suggest all peoples to follow any ways from these two there is no tolerence in ways the main facter is victory. According to a survey conducted by a university cooperation is the best way to achieve victories because it gives a perfect output .
