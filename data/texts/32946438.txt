i can not be happy if i interfere in the happiness of others. if i start living my life for the converts i will eventually go without a life for myself. this is the lesson i have learned from my life. in the past i started living for my parents without thinking about my goal.   as a result  i took a course i did not like for what they said in college.
 i also had a love life in college and it was a very beautiful moment .  i thought he was born into this world for me so dear. but my parents did not accept my love. when we found out about our love theyarranged for me another wedding. i lost my boyfriend and my goal for their happiness.
i still feel sad for that.half of my life has been spent fighting for my happiness and peace. but all that my parents thought would make me happy was in vain. so learn to do what you love and live happily without livingto please others. living like that is the only pain that we and those we have  are at the way. being a life so everyone learns to live for themselves.  that life will make you happy.
