Did you know you could make millions of dollars through social media? All you have to do is become a major social media influencer and guide others to the agenda you follow. People are most definitely influenced by images and impressions, so if you can create engaging content via video, images, podcasts, etc. , you can influence your followers to do anything you want! Advertising companies will even pay you to do this! It is almost as if the advertising and marketing firms decidcated years of research to understanding the human mind in order to better influence it. 

In fact they are so good at this there should probably be some sort of independent party or check and balance to ensure these firms are not abusing pyscological research in order to turn a profit. The average consumer cannot be trusted to ignore their devilish tricks. They are bombarded with images, lights, and sounds from the day they are born all trying to get them to consume some product. Humans are completley at the mercy of images and impressions from the moment they open their eyes. 

There is only one thing to do. Put a stop to the predatory marketing schemes that exploit our soft spot for images and content. We are too impressionable and allow these things to effect our emotions, thought process, and moral core. Maybe we should write our congressman to pass a law to make funds gained from adversting contracts illegal for government entites and organizations who receive govenment funds. This applies to the state and federal level. Or even better, maybe we should all just turn off the televisions, throw our phones in the freezer, and walk out into the forest, away from society, to find ourselves. The unimpressionable self is out there and would likely be a great conversationalist. 

I mean have you ever watched power rangers? There a very impressionable tv series that is directly aimed at the youth. No wonder there are so many little power rangers running around during Halloween...
