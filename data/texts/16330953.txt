Materialism, or the attatchment to money, or items, is a common human behavior. It's been found to give others meaning, if someone is materialistic about something that's not neccisarily a bad thing, but its not particularly a good thing either. Others should not be criticized for being attatched to any item, it is possible the item contains sentimental value, and or posseses monitary value to others, but if said person risks their life to obtain the attatchment item, concequenses could be their very life.

Materialism can have pros such as; bringing joy, happiness, or positive emotions to somebody. It can also have cons such as; loss of item bringing depression, misplacing the attatched item causing anxiety attacks, or even loss of life. It's a very human thing to be materialistic, even if not everyone will admit to such. We are all so quick to judge, critisize, and blame others that it can be eerie. For someone to have as many emotions as we do, we seek pleasure talking down about others, and we accumilate humiliation if we get talked down about for being materialistic.

Furthermore, each and everyone, is biasedly materialistic, if they would admit it or not. Modern society should not critisize, humiliate, dog down, or judge others for being sentimentially attatched to items, or money. Wealth is easy to achieve, items are replaceable, but the feelings said things can give cannot be replaced, or reproduced. If items get lost, some get anxious, or depressed, if gained some get joyous, happy, or greedy. Criticizm, in any way shape or form, isn't morally right, and being materialistic shouldn't be looked upon as horrendous. Its a very common thing, although just letting others go about in peace and ignorance is best. Materialism can be looked at from both standpoints, but it isn't something that should be criticized for.
