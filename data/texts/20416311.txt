   I believe that modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Everyone in the world wants to be able to own nice things and live a fulfilling life of luxury. This is not a bad thing, however humans need to be concious of how their material pursuits are affecting their environment and other humans. 
   Acquiring new things that bring happiness into a persons life should not be seen as wrong, in fact it is something worth celebrating. Everyone should have the right to pursue such material goals and enjoy the material wealth that they currently own. However, a lot of people currently are not given the opportunity to realistically pursue their material desires. This is something that we should look to fix, so that as many people as possible can acquire their material desires.
   Many people criticize materialism because they see extremely wealthy billionaires flaunt their material gains, while most aren't able to acquire even a fraction of that material wealth throughout their lifetime. If people are given more access to realistically acquire their material desires I believe that resentment towards materialism will begin to dissapear and be replaced with a desire for more materialism. Everyone wants to be able to fulfill their material desires, and the lack of opportunities for the majority of people is the real problem, not materialism itself.
   Unchecked materialism does have issues of its own however. Materialism without restraints can lead to people damaging the environment and not taking care of the environment they live in. It is easy to pursue your material desires without caring about the environmental impacts of your actions. That is why materialism needs to have some sort of checks and regulations, so people and the environment do not get hurt by people's greed.
