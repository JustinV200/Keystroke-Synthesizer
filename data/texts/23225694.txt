Currently advertisements and media are at the forefront of our everyday lives. We pass by billboards and signs with pictures dipicting images advertisers think will hold our attention. More often than not the images shown are meant to be eye-catching and make us want whatever is being sold without giving any information as to what the product does. I think that these images and impressions have way too much of an effect on people today.

Companys use marketing to make you want things wether you need them or not. One way that do this is to have celebrity spokes people tell you how much they enjoy a certain thing. Everyone admires and looks to celebrities for entertainment. And if a celebrity uses the product then it must be good or it's cool. They use different colors that are said to make you feel certain things that will make you buy something. Another way they do this is to sexualize the product. The saying "sex sell" is prevalent in most media. Even for mundane products. They try to sell you a burger by slowing down the camera pans and playing sensual music over top of someone telling you how delicious the burger is. They make you want that burger when you could make the same burger at home and even spend less money. And that's what it boils down to; money.

Some might say that the images that your shown are what you the consumer make of them. Which to a point is true but we as a society are trained to want the products and services in the flashy 60 or 30 second advertisement that they shove in you face ever 15 minutes. You really have to reprogram youself to not fall for the ploy.

So with all of this it's very noticable that clever ads and images are pushed onto the comsumers to make them want whatever's being sold without even understanding way and without even actually needing the product.
