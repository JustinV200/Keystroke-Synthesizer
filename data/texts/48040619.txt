     The old adage is "two heads are better than one", which translates into teamwork accomplishes more than just a solo endeavor.  Unity is the key. If in business or in the community, there are better results when you have a number of people focused on the same goal, they are united and dedicated to a successful outcome. 
     If there is a need in the community for a refurbishing or gentrification, an individual would be overwhelmed by the costs and effort tha would need to go into such a large project.This migth be for a park to be planted with trees or a beach clean up. However, if you have a united front, meaning a number of people invested in the same dream of improving the environment where they live, so much more can be accomplished in less time, with the costs being spread out. In this manner, you can get the results you want, with the backup of individuals who are dedicated to the cause.
   The previous mentioned strategy applies to business ventures as well. You cannot succeed as swiftly or as smoothly when there is only one person involved. Having additional investors or business partners allows for new perspectives and eyes on the situation. It balances things out and gives a broader view, it also allows for weak areas to be noticed from another set of eyes. Teamwork that is geared to the same ultimate outcome, is more likely to be successful in business. 
    Whether it is for business or a philanthropic cause, working as part of a team is generally the safer bet. You have a shared value and goal. You also can bounce ideas off of one another, and solve issues together, rather than being left to sort through things alone. It also helps when there is an investment involved as it spreads it acorss several people and therefore they all have a vested interest in the endeavor turning out well.  It is apparent that being part of a team is more likely to obtain successful results than going solo.
