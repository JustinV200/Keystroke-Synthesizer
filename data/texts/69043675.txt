                                                                                            Cooperation and Competition

    Some people may feel that more sucess by cooperation or competition my not be achievable, also some people may bes pesimistic, and not believe anything is achievable. My thoughts are that you can achieve more sucess by cooperationg togeather or by having some friendly competition. you gain sucess in different forms from both. 

  With Coorpereation, you gain a since of self, worth, and relaitonships with those you are coopereating with. you grow as a person and may finds feelings deep down inside of you you never knew you had. you could become a new person, you could gain new friends, or become a different person all togeather.
   
    With Competition, you can gain a since of self also, you can awaken and bring to the surface emotions, strength,pride, and a sinse of worth, a fire from deep inside, or differnt abilities you never knew you had.  You may have felt weak or had a sinse of cowardlyness. But afterwards feel strong, and ferocious like a lion.

     You could have a competion that requires cooperation, and have to work togeather in the competiontion pulling your part at something you thought you could never do, but because your team relies on you and you give echother support and pull through all tronger than ever.

    In closing I would like you know that I speak from experiance, I have went in to competiontions by myself and came out a better person. I have came out stronger than I wass before and had more pride and respect for myself for what I was able to accomplish. I have also had to cooperate with people to get a job or assignment done and we all came out better people for and got a good grade with it or won a competion, and were the first group to get done. I've made good friends that I am still friends with today. So Competition, and cooperation leeds to sucess in one way or another.
