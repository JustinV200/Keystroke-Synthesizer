I don't think  modern society should be critized for being materialistic at all because I think this can bring a lot of joy and happiness to all of us. I think having the finner things in life is a great thing and shouldn't be looked down upon for getting them and working hard for you and your family. If the person is a hard worker and wants nice things that shouldn't be a problem to anyone. It's all what the person wants in life . If they want a nice car with all the bells and whistles then thats there business and no one should look down on them as if they think that there better than other individuals that cant afford to buy a fancy car. 

I think it's very immature for people to critize others for the lack of not having wealth/things in life and it's not fair for the people who can afford it or there looked down upon. This is not a good thing at all for the world. 

I think if the world didn't focus on what others have and just worry about themselves the world would be a better place with less crime with love and happiness.
