I think people get caught up too much in images of other. Most people rely on what they see. It gives them the impression that they have to live up to their favorite celebrity and walk thesame path they did to get where they are. They also think that they must buy the same brands they own even if they cant afford to do so. Most people do not understand companies pay celeberities to advertise their products. In all honesty, they may not even like the brand but are paid well to act like they do.

I have seen products in the supermarket, chain stores will carry a brand in their stores for sales because they know people or fans really do copy whatever it is their celebrity endorses even if it means the quality isnt high standards but they know someone will want it if they see their name or face on the product. We benefits? Not the ones that work hard for their money. Middle class hard workers not millionaires.

I think we put too much trust in what we think we need compared to what is really worth the money to help others make a name for theirselves and money in their pockets. It is the way of life because we do this every day in our choices we make. We will always do what they want even if they dont seem to be what we think they really are. This goes foranyone who is in the public eye.I know I saw things that I didnt approve of etc..but I am just one person who cant make a big change but as long as I dont buy into this thery, I am not letting anyone influence me at all. I see what they do and dont have to like it.
