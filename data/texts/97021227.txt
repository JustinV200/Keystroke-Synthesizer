The pursuit of happiness is dependent on fulfilling your dreams and achieving your personal goals. Real joy stems from the realization that you had a desire, you took steps to make it happen and the satisfaction that results in realizing you just achieved your goals. Imagine an entrepreneur standing in the middle of her first store and looking back on all the work it took to make it to that point and the emotion that results in thinking "I did it!" That surge of happiness is from overcoming obstacles and generating self confidence and pride in her ability to create a reality out of her dream.

Working towards a goal generates a mental thrust of satisfaction that results in power and achievement. Knowing that the reward of working hard will get that goal closer and closer also creates it's own momentum of positive reinforcement. It feels great to figure out a problem and know you've solved it. Coming up with a creative solution leads to more enthusiasm that can sustain through the inevitable setbacks. Learning from mistakes leads to mastery over the next task.

Happiness can be generated within oneself and not be dependent on another. It can also feel great to give back and help someone else and receive their gratitude. However the most powerful emotions are linked to our own achievements because we intimately know every detail of our own experience. We remember the initial idea, all the doubts, fears, the decision to go for it and all the major and minor successes and failures it took to get to the goal. Our dream is happening because we made it happen and nothing feels better than that.
