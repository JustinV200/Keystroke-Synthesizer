According to the promt the reader's interest is to knowing about Materialism. Materialism is nothing but acquiring possessions and spending money. Most people criticize modern society for being too materialistic and most of the people spend energy producing and consuming more and more stuff.

When the question rises "Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?", i said  "Yes". Because in my life i realize the materialism. I see many people spend their energy and money to produce or manufacture many stuffs for the other people in the society called consumers. There are lot of stuffs filled in our society. But the truth is, not all stuffs are useful to people for consuming. People only spend their money for the stuffs they needed or for their essential stuffs only.

Remaining are still filled in our society. Though it remains, many modern society people doesn't stop producing more and more stuff and they waste their energy for materialism. This is the sad fact. My opinion about materialistic society is, don't waste your energy for producing more stuff. It will waste your money and time.

As a conclusoin, being materialistic will dangerous to the feature generations. We need more space to live in the earth without destroying the nature. When we produce more and more stuff, the living environment will be affected in the feature. So please do not criticize for being materialistic.
