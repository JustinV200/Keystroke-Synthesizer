My cousin is preparing for IAS and at first he has stuggled a lot but later on he learned that competition will helps oneself to reach great heights both in their personal and professional life. In this competitive world we can reject failure by facing this competition and improving knowledge through continous learning process. At first he thought acheiving success is not too complex for everyone because simply learning will bring success in all humans life. Everyday he faced a lot of competition and learned from that,today he is an IAS officer.But now through cooperation and the power it has brought was found to be an amazing and great one.If you like to reach great position we should know how to overcome from this competition.

In life cooperation and competition should not be a struggle in young generation life. They should learn from every mistakes in thier carrier. If an opportunity knocks your door use it in a right way. Because significant and efficient leaders has faced many failures and learned from it and used the opportunity when it reaches them.The opportunity is nothing but which is called as the "COMPETITION & COOPERATION".
