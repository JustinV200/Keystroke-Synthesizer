Im my own opinion happniss is brought by ones own interest and focus in things they like. Some people find this by focusing on their own personal goals or by focusing on other people's happiness. Most people who have found happiness by focusing on thier own goals and this peole have diffrent characteristics. They may seem to be very boring and uninteresting because they somehow don't care about others. This kind of people are always on the wach of their actions and plans.

Finding happiness by focusing on other people's happinness does not make a person happy. By this , one has no option of finding his own happiness other than by blending in with those they think are happy than them. This kind of people are characterised by giving up easly on what they do. They can't find a reason to do things that make them happy. They will always be depending on others to get their needs

People will always find things that make them happy some time in life. But, the way you do your things that make you happy matters a lot. Doing happy things because your peers are doing them does not mean you are happy.Happiness is is defined by one's true actions. Having a strong sense of ones self responsibilities leads to more happiness in life.
