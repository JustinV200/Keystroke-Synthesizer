Yes i think this society is materialist for the fact is spending money on expensive cars and houses and really dont have the money they use savings to buy expensive cars and then they are never happy after they just think having all the stuff will makes them happy and it doesnt it makes them broke and unhappy after a while expensive cars and houses are reallly not a good thing in this world a lot of stuff is just a waste of time buying buy what you can afford and whats goimg to make you happy when you know your money can afford. i think materlistic people are show offs cause they have money so they can buy any and everything they want and they are happy until the day they realize that the money will not last and have to get rid of the things that was bought happiness is having things you need not want and when you go broke getting everything you want is not a good thing you have to sell or just give away for beind greedy. I learned a lesson i was once greedy and now i wish i had the money for being greedy. I bought a lot of stuff that i know i couldnt afford now im not happy at all cause all that money i could have been saving this world is made of peoples want not needs.Ihope people will learn how to use there money wisley.
