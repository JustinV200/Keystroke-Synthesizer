In today's society, everything is always so impressionable and everyone can be easily influenced. Advertising has always been a thing, but I think with the rise of social media, the lengths advertisers can go to has reached new highs. What is the most popular thing going around right now? What is selling the best? How would the thing I am doing affect people socially, econonically, and how would it affect the enviorment? These are all things advertisers have to consider when coming up with advertising techniques.

I think that images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. Because of what I mentioned previously, everyone in some sort of way is easily influenced by what is trending. A big portion of what is trending has to do with visual aids. People are going to be more likely to buy something that is bright and flashy rather than something that is dull and black and white. It has to catch their attention first. And when things catch the attention of the right people, that's when a trend happens. And the trend will rise and fall whenever someone finds something else that is flashy.

There is no real way to prevent this. This is what society is now. We are all influenced by our friends, our family, our favorite celebrities. You have to be on top of trends if you want your product to sell. You have to have connections in the world. But yes, at the end of the day, images and impressions absoulely have too much of an effect on people. People will go out of their way to buy a product even if it's not particularly goo,d, just because the wrapping is bright green.
