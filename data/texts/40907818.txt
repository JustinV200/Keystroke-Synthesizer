       Modern society is about changing life cylce over and over again. Materialism shouldnt be cristiczed since everyone in the world spends time spending money buying clothes taking fmaily out to eat its part of life and enviortment if this wasnt happening in modern time it would probalby look like the 80s and look very poor middle class. 
       Modern society in our time is one of the grestest time century there is since there more modern day sotres to eat, buy clothes, electronic. Most of the modern society is better for digital techonloghy and also for the next generation to come foward and change the modern life.
       In my opinion i dont think modern life should batched at all since with spending its a part of living since you have to pay for life expenses like bills for the house , food , water , light , clothes to wear so now its baiscally materialism in modern day life of gold and inflation. We also have to look at it as america becoming one of the largest states on the world so its more material being sold to americans now and also have people are consuming for goods then ever before becuause of economic inflation. 
       Everyone is this modern day life is in full of excitement in our time many people use they materialisctic things into buying life happiness such as flowers , candles , smell goods products and many more. Some other people use it for cars,houses and even buying big business or small comapnay that would make them live a modern life.
