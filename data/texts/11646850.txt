In everyday life, we often see different things and places advertised in different ways. Some things are more colorful than others and some brands even advertise things in a more colorful way to get more business. I personally love when things are more colorful and interesting because it keeps me entertained. Compared to when things are less colorful, in black and white, it is not entertaining, therefore I probably wouldn't buy that product. I do think that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.
In many articles I have seen about things in black and white versus in color, black and white has a worse rep than in color. Having things in color makes it feel a lot more real than being in black and white. We don't see the world in black and white, most people see it in color. Therefore, in color is a lot more relatable to our world. Though, people who are colorblind often see the world in colors that they may not be in actually. So in that case black and white would be better for people who are colorblind so they can tell what the true color is. Although there aren't as many colorblind people in the world as there is people that aren't colorblind. 
Everything in our world is mostly in color to be more interesting and to be more relatable to what everybody actually sees in the real world. Because we see in color we know what real things look like and I think that brands or companies often exaggerate the amount of color in their advertisements. We all are so used to being in color that we don't like things like movies or commercials in black and white.
