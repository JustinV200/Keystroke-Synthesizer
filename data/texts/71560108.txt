Cooperation versus Competition

One may say the being competitive will make you successful faster but not all of situation calls for competition. Competition sometimes if not most of the time give negative vibe and thoughts to people. Because of this negativity it hinders success instead of being helpful. Competion is good but being overtly competitive is not, it makes you look too assertive at times which doesn't help with your reputation. A little competitiveness goes a long way I believe because it makes you strive to do better but not at the cost of other peoples effort or work. 

Cooperation I believe is the best way to succeed. You may think being cooperative means you are a push over, it doesn't. You show know your boundaries though when cooperating, you have to know when to say no and say enough is enough. Cooperation makes the work place harmounious and a place where people like to work unlike when everyone is competitive it just makes the work place a  stressful one. 

Cooperation is good for both companies and workers because having a harmounious relationship between workers and higher ups means more thing getting done and just over all increase in production. Overall a little competition is ok and a lot of cooperation is the key to success. Balance between the both is what everyones need.
