From my perspective, these days I'd say one would likely be happier if they were to focus on their own personal goals. Doing what you can to maintain a state of content may be better for ones own health, than worrying about how everyone around is doing. However, if everyone you encounter seems to be unhappy, that will undoubtedly have a negative effect on your own state of content / happiness. Considering that, it would probably be best to find some balance of focusing on yourself and doing what you can to improve our collective well-being. Think big, act locally, and pay much attention to your own well being!

Additionally, people who completely focus on themselves and their own goals / ambitions, with little regard for how people around may be doing could actually end up appearing bitter, selfish, greedy, sociopathic. In some cases, that's probably best for certain types of people, and one shouldn't be criticized for being that way. Considering morale for the average person seems to be at an all time low—worldwide, in some case it could probably be difficult for one to just focus on their own expectations or goals. 

So in my opinion, the best thing one can do is try to find a balance. I am a very introverted person, and I personally feel better off most of the time focusing on what I can actually control. I'd like to see things change some day, the world shouldn't have to be such a grim place.
