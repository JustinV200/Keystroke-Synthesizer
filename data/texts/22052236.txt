   Here we are going to discuss about how happiness plays a role between the peoples.
   There are two sets of people in the world who are in the two different mindsets.one part of the people says that happiness is only to achieve goals. such , people are having target to be focussed on some goal and they are eager to achieve their goal. after reaching  their success they will feel their happiness.
   The another set of peoples are those who are happy on others. people are those who are happy by others (i.e) satisfacting the people's or a persons who are surrounded by them. satisfacting  the persons needs who are living with them.  if the people surronded with them were happy they will feel their real happiness.
  Now a days peoples satisfacting with others happiness is rare. people become selfish they focused on their own and personal goals to get their happiness. those people doesn't bother about others. the world is running fast.we are living in the competitive world all are running for their needs and selfless people are rare.
   according to my belief what iam concluding is the persons who focus on their personal goals and who was happy by seeing others happiness these two things and 2 percetive is totally  based on a people's mindset. type -I people of achieving their own targets have high majority in current days. type-II people of being happy on the happiness of others is rare.
