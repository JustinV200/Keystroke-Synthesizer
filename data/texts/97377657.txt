Images and impressions can effect people differently. For some, they pay little to no attention to the images and impresions around the. For others, they are simply overwhelmed by the images and impressions. Advertisers and marketers take advantage of this. 

Images and impressions can be an important tool in advertising, but it seems their effect, or lack of, on people is often overlooeked in favor of the advertisers and marketers bottom line. More care should be paid to how these images and impressions are used in the world around us, as even a little to much can be detrimental. 

For example, some people are overwhelmed by the things going on around them and have to medicate to cope, or even abstain from interacting with the world around them. 

I think that advertisers should strive to lessen their impact on our world, and I think brand owners should do the same. It is important for us to think of our fellow humans in our daily activities and work. Maybe the solution is to make all advertisements optional at the individual level, that way every one has more control over their environment. This would help every one to have a better life and more sanity. 

Maybe instead of advertising, we should just let people do their own research. That way, every one can moderate how many images and impressions they take in. Thank you
