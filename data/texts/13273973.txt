You are on a road trip, and after many hours of driving on the freeway you pass a billboard advertisement for McDonalds. Already salivating, you reminisce on how good those spicy McNuggets looked. So crispy and fresh looking, and they were only $5 for 20 nuggets! How could you pass that up? Immediately, you take the closest exit to find that McDonalds. You get to the drive-thru, order those spicy McNuggets, then pick it up at the end. Then, you pull into a parking spot in the parking lot and open up the McNuggets box. It was warm, but they didn't look anything like they did in the billboard advertisement. They looked uncrispy, stale, old, and dry. If you knew the spicy McNuggets were going to be like this, you never would have ordered them. That billboard advertisement lied to you! You totally thought the item you received would be just like how it is advertised to be, but it absolutely was not even close. Images and impressions indeed have too much of an effect on people, and this is seen in many other circumstances, not just McDonalds. People are more likely to be enticed by these images and impressions because they are curated to do exactly that.

First, behind every clever advertisement or enticing image is a team of designers that twist the reality of a product or idea in order to make it seem more desirable. These people are skilled in what they do; they know what will draw people's attention, and they make sure that the product is advertised in a way that will achieve that goal. Even though it isn't natural, people will still fall for the false promises of these advertisements because the general population does not know the work that takes place behind the camera in order to produce these attractive images and impressions of products. People think this is how the product really is, so they fall into the trap of supporting or desiring that product solely due to the images and impressions of it. 

One may say that people are not actually very affected by images and impressions, but this is not true, especially regarding anti-smoking advertisements. Many brands of cigarettes will have warnings on them that nicotine is a dangerous substance with high potential for abuse, and there are many billboards with images that depict the horrible effect of smoking on the human body. Yet, none of this prevents the average smoker from quitting, so it can be argued that people are not actually strongly influenced by images and impressions. However, to the average non-smoker, these images and impressions are more than enough to deter them from even touching a cigarette. Not everyone is strongly affected by images and impressions for products, but it accurate to say that the majority of the population is.

In conclusion, images and impressions have an incredibly strong influence over the general population's decisions because the people who curate these images do so for that sole purpose. Today's society is built upon setting good impressions to the point where people believe that those impressions are truly a representation of the item's quality.
