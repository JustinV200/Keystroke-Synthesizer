                  People always seek happiness, but for finding it they do several things like having some addictions. Happiness comes from the way we think of an incident we can also fine happiness by helping others when they are in trouble .
                  Our happiness may be selfish or selfless, there is nothing wrong but your own happiness may be for an hour, when you make others happy by helping them or consoling them while they are feeling sad gives you lifelong happiness as they won't forgot your help until they die the gratitude shown by a person who is helped by you is more worthy than happiness.
                   Being happy is not an achievement it's just entertainment , but making others happy is really an achievement. Being kind and making everyone happy is not a wrong thing or difficult task, you can make someone happy by being kind with them and helping them. Every person has a problem when we console them, they will be very happy as in this world no one care about other peoples problems, worries. If you do so they feel like they had a person by their side. 
                    In my opinion people are more likely to be happy when they focus on others happiness more than their own.
