  There are two types of people. Those who play well with others and those who always want to run over others to get where they want to go. You can cooperate and help everybody achieve their dreams, or you can compete against them and satisfy your own carnal hunger.

  Let's look at some pros and cons. Cooperating with people will not only give you a sense of humility knowing that you've been kind to someone, but it will also help the other person out and help their view of you to be more positive. Running over people and trying to turn everything into a competition should make you feel bad and it makes the people you run over feel bad as well. People feel small and unimportant. They feel like they can't do anything right when you compete with them and all you get out of it is self satisfaction and usually a bad reputation.

   In conclusion, do people achieve more successs by cooperation or by competition? Cooperating with others, especially in your work place, is better than trying to compete and it will help you to be more successful. You're more succesful that way because you've been fair and it's more important to be a humble, fair, and kind person than it is to get a big promotion by running over everybody else and making somebody just as important as you feel small. Even if you get the promotion over them, you can be satisfied with yourself knowing that they helped you and you were fair. Everybody deserves a fighting chance so we should all help each other out and cooperate. Working with others nicely also helps you to gain more friends in life!
