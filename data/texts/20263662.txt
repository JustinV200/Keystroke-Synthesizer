i think happiness can be from personal goals & on happiness of others. first lets go to the personal goals.

personal goals to me is what you set for yourself as you get older. i can be very simple goals at first then as time goes by more detailed goals. first a person may want to go to college to learn about these goals then when they graduate they set out looking for jobs. these jobs can start out at entry levels and more you stay with whatever company the more advanced goals can come into play. not to mention raise in pays.  they may even go out on their own in their own business. granted doing that you may learn things the hard way but at least you learning.

goals on the happiness of others well thats a bit diffcult to understand but lets see. i would say donating your time to charities. not money cause thats monetary. im talking about actually doing something to help others. me personally i like pets so if i did that i would go to pet shelters & help out there. pets dont understand the situations they in so any tender loving care a person can give to the animals im sure would be appreciated the workers and especially by the pets. if you dont like pets theres homeless shelters where you help people.

so like i said there are two ways to be happy. i think the personal goal is what people do most of cause even when you are young somehow goals are imbedded in the brains by the elders. i think the richer the family is the harder these goals are taught the children. then again if they werent rich they may work harder at it.the goals on happiness of others is a choice people would choose to do as they grow up.  the donating to help others is what people choose to do. 

i hope i explained this properly.  especially the part of happiness of others if i understood that properly. these were purely my thoughts.
