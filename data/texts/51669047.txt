Humans are social animals. Despite this fact we are always under the stresses of competition. Competition is what drives the human spirit forward and gives us a sense of purpose. While cooperation will always be important to the struggles of mankind, and many jobs cannot be done alone, it is the competition that's the main factor in the achievement of success in any field.

Throughout history competition is the main factor to drive evolution. Without competition most animals, plants, even inanimate objects would be the same. Without the constant comparison and play off of eachother the competition would get stale. With repitition comes lack of originality and a sort of symbiosis of mutual respect. There is nothing there to draw the line. Nothing to compare or attempt to be better than. Cooperation is incredibly important, but without the competition and constant innovation to come with it we would not be where we are today; like that of a virus, cooperation (even down to a cellular level) can only get so far. Even the pyramids in their glory, were constructed under the backbone of slavery; slavery being the only human equivalent of a hive -mind workforce.

In closing, without competition the world would be worse off. There would be no reason to truly do anything except to help one another. The only way full cooperation has worked in society is times of war, slavery, or extreme need. In a society where you are exactly the same as everyone else it disincitivizes aiding others in the first place.
