materialism is the act of acquiring possessions and spending money, people work hard to earn money, why do people do this? obviously to spend it and enjoy it, people trade their hard work for money and happiness. Happiness can relative, peoples happiness can differ from person to person. If acquiring something gives someone happiness then they should be given the freedom to do so. 

People should not be criticized for doing something they like to do. If a person is materialistic then he/she should not be judged for being such. It is an interesting concept nontheless, we all do this subconciously but later judge people for it, ask anyone if they like recieving gifts, chances are they will for sure say yes, now will you judge that person for being a materialist? of course not, it is an absurd way of criticizing people. Nowdays people will criticize people for almost anything, whats next? being criticized for having a pet?

So in conclusion I just want to say it is okay to be a materialist, heck i would even say it is a nature of human being, so people should not criticize for others being materialist. Such absurd criticism is truely unworthy of anyone's time.
