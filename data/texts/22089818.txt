     When considering the top levels of success, competition is often the catalyst that pushes individuals to achieve higher levels than previously thought possible. There is an inate drive inside human beings to be the best at whatever the situation may be. This drive pushes us beyond ourselves and what we would normally accomplish.
     Take, for example, Venus and Serena Williams. They have dominated women's tennis for over 20 years, beating everyone else and taking home countless titles. They grew up playing against each other on the courts of Compton, and continued that competetion into professional tennis. Would either of them have reached the lofts of repeated major champion year after year without having each other to push back against? I honestly don't think so. I think the competition that was born between them is what created the greatest player of all time in Serena. Without Venus, she may never have found that next gear that we've all seen her shift into. Had Venus not been diagnosed with an autoimmuno disorder that drains her energy, I think she would've been more of a threat. Even-so, she still pushes herself to play to this day.
     You can argue that cooperation is the better way to acheive success, and there is something to be said for it. Great things can come from people working together towards a common goal. However, I still believe that competition will always bring us to a higher level than simple cooperation can acheive. It pushes us to be the best versions of ourselves in the long run.
    So, if you really want to be successful, I suggest finding some good competition. Practice your craft with someone better than you. Don't shy away from it out of fear of losing. It will make you push harder than you would've before. When it's all said and done, you will be glad that you chose to go up against someone who is challenging and brings out the best in your game.
