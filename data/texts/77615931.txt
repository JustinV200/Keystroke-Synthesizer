Comparsion between co-operation and competition at work places.
Some people usually think like co-operation is the way to success  and some other people think competition is way to success. co-opertion of work is the success of team while competition prove's the individual capability.
For example  in a company were twenty (20) people working, Individual can achieve target easily having competition with other people. While co-operation will make the team to achieve the target easily. co-operation is the type of smart work which is easy to do while competition is a thing were everyone need to work hard. Every individual has their own capabilities and limits and everyone cannot do the same work in same time. So keeping competition between people makes everyone to develop their skills and working ability. Co-operation in a team makes the total team to achieve target and individual will not be identified seperately.
So every one should have a competition among the people working and when working as a team they should be cooperative so every one can achieve target and can achieve success. The individual who is working hard will be notified when he achiving his or her individual targets while in cooperation people will achieve the team target.
