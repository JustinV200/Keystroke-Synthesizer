Materialism is a lot easier to experience in the 21st century because of our easier access to material goods. Should we should be criticized nowadays for being overly materialistic? No, we earn what we get. Is it fair to want more and more things in our lives if we spend most of our time earning money needed to acquire these things? The answer is yes. Completely fair for you want to want material goods in exchange for your hard work. 

What purpose do you have to work if you can't spend what you earn on the things you want? We need to feel fulfilled, and a good way is through materialism. Modern society deserves to be criticized for being materialistic, but we also need to account for what we give up to be able to attain things to begin with. Giving up your limited amount of time to earn money to acquire things is a good justification for materialism.

Just because someone doesn't want to spend their money acquiring goods does not mean the rest of society has to follow that example. A good economy relies on materialism. For our economy to thrive, goods needs to be sold, and for goods to be sold we need materialistic individuals to buy them. When goods are sold, they need to be replaced by someone working to make those goods. Materialism is a major part of helping modern society to function and grow. You should want to be materialistic because you have earned what you have attained.
