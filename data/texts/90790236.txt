Can people be happy when they focus on their own personal goals or when they focus on the goals of others? Can we truly be happy if we only focus on only ourselves? Does happiness come by making others happy? I think happiness can be found with a combination of both. We must strive to find happiness with our own personal goals which includes finding happiness for others. These two goals can and should be combined.
For example, my own personal goal is to give my children a foundation to be succesful in their lives. In turn when they are succesful in their lives they will be happy. This will also make me happy. In turn my personal goal includes myself and others. Happiness is found by my own personal goal of happiness that includes others happiness.
So you may say this is a goal of helping others. But it is so much more, a true fullfilment of my personal goal and a goal of helping others. I beleive a combination of your own personal goal which is also a goal of helping others is the best way to find happiness. These two goals can become one. So to find true happiness, I believe you must combine your happiness with an extension of finding happiness for others. I can find happiness by my own goals which offers happpiness for both me and others. This way of achieving goals of happiness can improve the world we live in. 
If we all look at happiness this way maybe we can create a happier world for ourselves and others.
