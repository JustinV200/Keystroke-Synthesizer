It is human nature for humans to want to be happy or satisfied with their work.  That way many people tend to spend their earnings on items to show the progress of hard work.  In a world where work and school take up most of peoples lives its easy for people to want to indulge with passions. With times changing I think modern society shouldn't be critcized for being materialistic.

Materialism is a thing that differs person to person. Someone might think a item or affection for a hobby isn't interesting or a waste of time. It is up the person to decide what they want in life. Happiness is a key factor in work ethics. Many material items are used for bonding experiences, and finding new friendships. I have learn many of thing from people online and how much love certain things. It helps me learn about more as a person. Now blind affection for how important a material item is a different thing. 

The world is huge place. Many people created different objects for people use at their leisure or for helpful reason. Sometimes it feels that society wants people to feel different from each other and spread hate. People should use materialism to find common ground and learn from each other.
