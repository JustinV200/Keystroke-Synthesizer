now a days many people are in materialistic manner.materialism is nothing but the human beings associated with other emotions like happy, sad, love,care and like some positive and negative addiction activities. materialism can have both advantages and disadvantages. the materialism will affect recent generation more. they do not have any kinds of savings for future use. 

we cannot  tell them it as a bad one. because without money we could not able to do anything in our day today life.may be the reasons they were in realistic manner. we should not be in more materialistic world. beacuse there are so many things are there which we could not buy by using money.

we have to be in mid always. we should take care of our loved ones and ourself with more care. we cannot make them happy always with the help of money. i hope there was a huge  difference between taking care of loved ones with care and giving money for them.
for example: if your mother was suffering from fever means. you have to sit by side her and should give her medicine at that time you cannot give money to her and ask her to take care herself. So Dont be More Materialistic Be in a midway forever.
