  I do believe that images and impressions have an effect on people but more in a negative way.  One of the things that come to mind is softdrinks and juices that are colored with some sort of artificial colorant that seems to condition people to be more attracted to those products.  These visiual enhancements don't add to the quality of the product and in some cases could be questionable if it is a healthy practice. I also noticed that dried fruits, fish and meats in most cases are enhanced with unatural coloring.  I believe most people don't realize just how much is done to create that unatural color that is to make that product more attractive.
  I personaly find this disturbing and try  to not purchase products that have all these unnecessary colorants.  I honestly wished we would have choices that were more in there natural state.  That being said it isn't an easy thing to avoid.
  On a more personal note my family and I are establishing are own food source, for multible reasons and this is one of them.  We live in a society that is so conditioned by media, advertisments and convieneces that it seems to me we have lost our grip on what is real.
