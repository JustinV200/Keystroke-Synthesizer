Happiness to me is something you feel when you do something important with your life. I don't believe one can truly be happy with only making others happy. I have lived that experience most of my life so far. And it hasn't done much of good for me other than having a loving heart in trying to please others in order to feel some sense of fulfillment.

I for one, feel doing my own personal goals feel a lot better than what I was doing when I was set out to make everyone else happy in terms of waiting on them, cleaning, listening to what they want and etc. I forgot all about me over the years and I am so far behind, or at least I feel that I am. Being that I am 38 years old and have to live with family again. I helped take care of my mom who had COPD. Not that she didn't deserve that love and attention or help, because she was my guardian when I was a teenager. However, I still didn't give myself  "real value" or "me time" without feeling guilty or wrong in return. I don't want to live like that anymore. My mom has passed and I miss and love her dearly, but now I can fully focus on me for once. I have always given my all to relationships/friendships as well and still do but this time I am not forgetting about me. So don't you forget about you!

In conclusion, it seems we have to be a little selfish sometimes in order to feel our happiness through our own goals and passions/talents we possess. I again believe truthfully that a person cannot be whole-heartedly happy by making others happy alone. It is important to take care of you first, or you will not be able to ever feel true happiness in the end.
