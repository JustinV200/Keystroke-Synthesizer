  I want to ask you a question, does buying things make you a materialistic person and does that warrant immediate criticism? There are many reasons to buy things, you need material items just for everyday living, buying material items may bring you joy that may be part of a reward for yourself, there may be material items you acquire that enhance your life and make for a better future.
  I say that there is no reason to criticize a materialistic society, modern materialism enhances our daily lives by creating progressive industries that can rely on a population to translate that progress into improvements, these processes can then inturn be used to improve future generations of goods and materials. For example the propensity for a society to purchase the latest automobiles makes sure that they become safer and cleaner to drive in the future because that is what society will purchase. The flow of goods from design and engineering to manufacture to distribution to the consumer is the single largest economic enviroment in any society, it takes at least 100 people to bring you the pair of pants you are wearing, a very diverse group of people also.
  There are those that say that crass consumerism is deterimental to our society and our environment yet that doesn't take into account the propensity for society to consume material items that are recyclable and require less resources like electricity to operate. If there wasn't a demand for these items then there wouldn't be any incentive for industries to innovate to make sure that we have the most efficent products that can be had.
  There's no reason to criticize materialism, it lets people be who they want to be, if the items that they are consuming make them happy then they are a better person for it, who should criticize that?
