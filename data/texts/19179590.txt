Happyness is a tricky beast. People need different things in order to feel happy. This topic begs the question, are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others? 

In my opinion, a 50/50 split of both is a good balance and the key to happiness. I have seen many examples of people who are on one side of the fence or the other. Some people only gain happiness from doing something for another person, while others only feel happiness when accomplishing a goal they have set for themselves.  I think when you focus on your dreams and goals for yourself and also have a good balance of helping others, you could become truly happy. Someone could have all the money in the world and have accomplished all their goals, but may have never helped anyone in their life. 

In my own experience, I have been clean from drugs for over 6 years now. This makes me immensely happy, but when I see someone going through the same things I did, it makes me sad. That is why in order to balance the scales so to say, I help people when I see them in that situation. I buy them a meal or give them a blanket. The simplist of things can bring back that initial happiness I felt of being so grateful that I am not in that lifestyle anymore.

Sure, someone could say that one or the other should make you perfectly happy. But in my experiences in life, I don't feel completely fulfilled by just pursuing my own dreams and goals or just helping helping someone else obtain theirs. The balance of having both in my life make me the happiest of all. Why do only one thing to be happy when you could do two and be even happier? That is why I think you have to do both to be truly happy in life.
