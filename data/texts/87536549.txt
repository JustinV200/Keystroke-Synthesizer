To me the first and the foremost thing on seeing this promt is ,the appearances that people see are mistaken for reality. Even several advertisements create a favorable impressions on attraction people like us.. Even some may cheat us on their appearances. Example a guy with coat suite comes and approaches us to sell a product. On seeing his appreance people believe that he is genuine one rather a untidy person. So appearance is most important here.

From this we can understand that what we should not believe what we see,even if it was in a attractive colourful package. So whatever we need must be a high contentful one..

Likewise politicians ,entertainers and public figures look gorgeous to our eyes. But we dont know their abilities directly. Only on seeing them on TV or some stages or on cinemas our mind automatically belive that they are good and most effectful persons around us. so we should always look around, and read the actual apperance of a thing or a product or a person indepth .some times our judgement may be wrong some times our judgement might be correct. so according to this prompt we should not blindly trust only by any apperances.
