an english adage states that ''some times one creates  a dynamic impression by saying something , but sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent.'' it is a well  worn clich in our era  in which everything truly insightfull has already been said . 
our ancestors who coined  the adage were sending a clear  and powerfull message to their descendants;impression  and images are not  the main factors that determine what kind of people we are nor does it judge our behaviour .indeed it is our actions that reflect our inner thought and decide which category of people we belong to. it is our true horizon that proves our values in this world .
impression can merely offer people a vague contour of a person we recently ,met. but it does not always remain unchangeable as long as we delve into the deep side of a persons character and his achivement . the  prestigious theoretical british physicist  who reowned for his contribution to the feilds of cosmology and quantum gravity ,stephen william hawking , unfortunately suffered from the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  which forced him to  maintain his   life with the help of  technical devices . the first time i saw his shocking image in my science textbook ,i was totaly paralyzed .
lying on side  of his wheel chair with a stiff smile on his face all the time he could only  write on a computer with small movements .impression is a spontaneous image  of others  formed at instant  that we  meet the person ,but that impression will never last forever and wont  have much effect on our judging .further communication and deeper understanding are the  most effective methods that can enable us to touch the true characteristics of a person.
