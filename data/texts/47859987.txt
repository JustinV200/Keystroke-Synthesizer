Indeed. Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people, so much so that many people mirror what they see and most often than not make it even worse. People would always try to outshine, outdo what they perceive to be more, better and.. what's worse, weirder and so on. It is like nothing is genuine anymore. Filters and photoshops. Almost everything is fake. 

In the advent of technology and rampant social media, people nowadays are so detached from reality. Whatever the gorgeous influencers would feed them - what to buy, what to watch, who to adore,they would just blindly follow -they would accept without even thinking about it. Well, that's why they are called 'media influencers' after all. 

We should also remember to test, try and see if a particular brand works and provide what they guarantee they could give. A wise man once said, "You should never believe a commercial on TV. If their products were so good, they wouldn't have to advertise them so hard." We have to be mindful of what we take in. Be it in mind or body. Always remember, garbage in, garbage out! 

People tend to forget about their own individuality, their own unique style, talent and skills. We forget about our abilities to imagine and create, enjoy what is natural and free and make do of what we have within our means.
