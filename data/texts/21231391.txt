  I know that there are many different types of personalities and that people an be motivied by all sorts of things.  But, in my personal experience I believe that healthy compeition is a great motivator and can often push people into achieving their goals. I believe this is done by tricking the brain into making tasks/jobs into a form of game. And who doesn't like playing games? Most of us grew up playing video games and striving to reach the highest score or beat the next level. So why not use that inspiration for achieving success in adult life.  This could mean trying to score the highest on a test in school or trying to score the most points in a sport. In the work place there could be games set up for most sales or most positive feedback.  I have worked with multple companies that have used similar things to help encourage good performance. Competition can also be a fun and playful way to get students or emplyees involved. One place of employment let us join into small teams and do step challanges to promote active lifestyles. It was fun and good for everyones health. 
  With that being said, I know some will say that competition does not promote camaraderie. I agree that certain types of people may shy away from these types of challenges or even feel intemidated. I also feel that for competition to be a motivator that everyone must feel like they are on a level playing field. I don't believe that anyone wants to play a game that they know they can't win.  Therefore, I know that creating a competative envirnment may not always be favorable.
  I think the arguement to which is the better between cooperation and compeition is going depend on the personality type.  I know for me a good healthy competition is a welcome challange!
