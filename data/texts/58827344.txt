I think that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.

If you look at all the great empires in the world that have risen and fallen, Egypt, Rome, Greece - the one common factor in the collapse of their empires is the hoarding of wealth by a select few. 

I think it is one of the few evolutionary compulsions that have driven humanity since the onset, which is to say the fear of not having enough. In times before society, that drive was what kept an individual alive long enough to procreate. 
And the more comfortable they became, the easier it was to have children and move things along down the genetic line. 

But as we moved away from a tribal society, as we started banding together in larger groups and not just moving around month to month and year to year, that compulsion stayed with us. And now that we exist in societies where food can be purchased at relative ease, housing can be acquired and all of our needs can be taken care of more often than not, the hoarding mentality has become poisonous. There is more than enough to go around - materialism should not be praised, having more things has become a sign of status and because many cultures are obsessed with status, including the societies mentioned above, you create the same vacuum that has occurred again and again within history.

I do not think materialism should be praised. I do think everyone needs to take a long hard look at what this kind of thinking can do to the world as a whole. History keeps repeating itself over and over again - owning things become a symbol of status, status is akin to power, power allows an individual to exert themselves over others and eventually the people who do not have power or access to those status symbols rise up against their oppressors and break everything apart ad infinitum. 

If we do not address the root of the problem, if we do not learn from those that came before, we will be doomed to repeat their mistakes.
