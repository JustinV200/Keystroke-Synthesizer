Happiness is something that every person in the world wants. It is a feeling that makes you feel free and limitless. But what is the best way to achieve happiness, by working towards your own hopes and dreams or by obtaining those hopes and dreams for others? Although obtaining the hopes and dreams of others is amazing in its own right, one can never truly be happy unless they focus on acheiving their own goals.

Obtaining your own goals can give a true sense of accomplishment. It is this accomplishment that gives people the happiness they desire. While acheiving someone else's goals for them may make you feel happy in the moment, that happiness will not last.  One needs to know that they did something with their life to feel that they completed their life story. A person without a completed story didn't really acheive the satisfaction that they could have had otherwise.

On the other hand, someone can achieve some happiness out of achieving goals for others. In some cases that may be part of their own person goal. A scientist who is trying to discove the cure for breast cancer is not only going to achieve his or her own goal if successful, but will also be helping those whose goal it is to beat breas cancer. However if ones goal is to have a husband and he or she becomes a matchmaker who constantly fulfills that need for someone else, that person is likely not going to end up happy. They may feel some kind of happiness in the moment of seeing a successful match but in the end they are likely to feel resentful that they never found that for themselves.

In conclusion, happiness for ones self is best met if they are working to acheive their own goals. It may sound like a selfish view but a person must meet thier own goals in order to truly be happy. Although they may obtain a momentary happiness in helping others, a true sense of happiness cannot be met that way. A momentary happiness is not going to lead to a lifelong sense of satisfaction in the end.
