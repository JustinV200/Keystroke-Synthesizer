Throughout history, humanity has shared one common thread: the search for meaning in life. Although life's purpose may look different depending on the individual, it ultimately can be measured in a peron's overall happiness. Happiness in life is attained by a focus on personal goals and the journey that results from working toward achieving them.

By setting a personal goal, an individual is outlining what happiness looks like for them. This might not be a conscious effort, at least not at surface level. For example, someone might set a goal to reach a particular level in their career. By reaching this level, they believe they will have the opportunity to make a larger difference in their field, perhaps interact with and impact more people, and have an increased income. Each of these benefits will offer improved happiness in their life: they will have more money to buy items or experiences, and live with the knowledge that they have left a legacy for the future. The journey along the way to meeting those goals also provides opportunities for developing happiness in life. 

The path that one takes while working toward a goal is just as important at promoting happiness as the goal itself. In the previous example, in order for a person to meet their personal goal of career growth, they must certainly make small steps towards this on a daily basis. Positive interactions with coworkers or clients would not only make progress on career advancement, but also improve personal happiness on a smaller, more regular scale. Finding purpose along the way to achieving a goal undoubtedly is the basis for true happiness in life.
