happiness by making others happy ,before that all happiness is what ,happiness it is a word that
decribe a feeling or an emotion some think that the people who laugh or smile are happy but
 really happy means the emotion or feeling that attained by physically,not mentally.happiness is
a mental feeling,that can't gained by physical emotions.some people in today's reality lose their 
goals for their temporary wealth they lose their future by focusing on temporary happiness.
        People are happy when they focus on their passion not on the job that solves their temporary 
issues cause of family and environment , our culture don't promote their child to focus on thier
passion they only make childrens to prepare for their needs of family,they don't get happiness 
on getting a job,they will be happy only if they chase their passion.

that makes our soul purified ,you will be really happy when you make others happy because on the 
moment when others become happy because of you makes you feel so proud ,on the you will think 
proud of yourself. Some people think about their future at positive way. All the people work hard to reach more high.
