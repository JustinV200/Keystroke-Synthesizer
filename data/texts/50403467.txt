Human beings are hard-wired to subconciously have bias regarding everything we see, hear or experience. It's a short cut to get through our day and make quick decisions so we can move on to the next decision. But what is the cost of making so many quick decisions based on outward appearances or impressions? 

Good public relations is essential for any successful Politician, public figure or corporation. The public has a good measure of right from wrong and will turn against someone or some entity if they are shown they are not what they seem. But we should instead deep dive and find more details and history on someone or corporation before making decisions with our votes or our dollars. Politicians, public figures and corporations have studies what makes us respond favorably and have customized their public ads and social media to reflect a specific persona. 

One example of good public relations leading to public harm involved Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder. For decades, this company was aware of the asbestos contamination and claims of ovarian cancer from its customers. Only after being sued in court, was the truth shared with the public. This company continued running ads with their powder and babies, giving the impression this was a safe product. 

Is it the public's fault for believing ads and social media? There used to be a widely used saying "Don't believe everything that you read." Do we make decisions to quickly and take the first word as the truth? The public should not blindly believe everything and then blame their misfortune on someone else. 

Politicians, public figures and corporations should act ethically. Thier focus should be on providing honest services and products to the public and "do no harm". 

Human beings will continue to have bias regarding everything we see hear or experience, but Politicians, public figures and corporations have a moral obligation to act ethically and ensure how they are represented reflects the truth.
