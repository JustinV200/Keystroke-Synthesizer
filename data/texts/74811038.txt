Images and impressions seem to a big impact in todays generation. Teens, kids, and some adults feel that they need to dress or act a certain way to fit in. In some cases people stop doing the things that make them happy because of fear of being critisized for the way the look or dress. I have witnessed people stop eating so the would lose weight just so they can fit in with what today's image trend is. In my opinion images and impressions have way to much of an affect on people.

Social media has a big part as to why todays generation feel they need to look a ciertan way or weigh a certain amount to fit. It makes me sad to have to witness these things. in my opinion people should be excepted for who they are. We should not have to change who we are to be accepted.

People with disabilites should not have to feel self consious because they are different, and don't fit the image that todays generation thinks everyone should look like. It is okay to be unique, it is ok to stand out. Todays generation should be taught that it is ok to be different and should accept people for who they are because let's face it the world would be so boring if everyone was the same. So to answer your question, yes I do think images and impressions have way to much of an affect on people.
