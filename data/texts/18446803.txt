I would like to address your attention towards the matter that has been presented. Most importantly, the matter wheather or not what we believe things to be true versues what really is true, is based on the person presenting the assumption. I agree that images and impressions have an effect on peoeple however, I make arguements that will valiadate my stance regarding this matter. People provide certain impressions for many different reason. Some people like to entertain, some people like to advertise, some people like the attention and sometimes what you see is who the person really is. 

Although outside influences does impact people, the reason this occur is because everyone wants to be accepted or feel as though they belong to a certain group. Therefore, rather than being themselves, they take on the actions, personality and images of that particular group. This aspect allow people to view others how they visually see that person. In reality, that person differ a great ordeal from what that person is perceving themselves to be. 

My fact-findings are people do things for various reason. It could be for social or economic gain. The successful way to characterize a person, is to know that person. This matter can not be obtained only by looking at the visual aspect. Once you talk with and get to know a person, other factors will be revealed when you speak with that person. Much like a reason why this study is being developed. This essay writing by people are of different age groups, different personality, different races will provide great details about how we preceive certain aspect to look. So therefore, reality is only what we percieve it to be.
