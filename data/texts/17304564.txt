You do not have to look far to see image and impressions having such a big impact on people ,, from advertisingf where Gatorade in the past was telling us to be "like Mike" or instgram is showing you how to be as glamourus Kim Kardashain or even our past president Donald Trump who got elected purely off of the media image he portayed of being this wealthy billionare businessman who does nothing but win.

These 3 examples of images to emulate aren't totally bad. Each one has a number off redeeming qualities. Micheal Jordan shows you what hard work and dedication can accomplish.  Kin kardashain show you how to achieve sucess. Donald Trump  show success through business. 
However while each of thses 3 icon can be admired for their many successes we should not ignore thier flaws.
Kim kardashian while rich, beautiful and sucessful also has many personal problems with her intimate relationships and places far too much empasis on matiral goods. Micheal Jordan while being undeniablely the greatest basketball player of all-time was down right mean to his competition and teammembers alike
Trump while obviously rich and powerful was also a racist, homophobic, cheater both in business and his mutiple marraiges.  Trump also tried to become basiclly a dictator all because he had such a loyal base that would do anything and everything for him.
Im not saying these 3 icon don't have things good about them but as with any image and impressions you have to look past just the image and see the true presonb or product behind the image otherwise you might become brainwashed.
