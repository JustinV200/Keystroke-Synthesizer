Are we surrounded by the abusive use of trickery and illusion, designed to keep us far away from reality, as hidden forces cash in on our ignorance? In my opinion, the overwhelming amount of data points towards a solid YES as an answer to this quite frightening question.

Let's consider the evidence, both objective and subjective.

A quick look at the news is all it requires to see the hands of manipulators at work. No matter the political position, Right or Left, the mainstream news presents features that seem sculpted by marketing teams. Designed to agitate to boost ratings and cause fear to have viewers return for their next dopamine fix.

Even worse is the new public square social media. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook present the idolized lives of celebritites in a false way designed to hook the young into trying to replicate this fiction in their own relationships, lifestyles, and even how their bodies look. But since these are fictional staged cut outs, achieving these questionable goals is impossible. 

The negative impact on mental health created and amplified by social media platforms and their twisting of reality is only recently showing its frightening face.

Is this immoral and unethical, or just "good business"?

Some argue this this playing with reality is the "right" of corporations and citizens as an element of free speech. I won't argue against this concept, but can anyone say that this is rewarding for anyone except a tiny few who cash in on these lies?

We need to redirect these currents towards the positive. It is difficult but can be done. With hard, smart work.

It is a worthy, honorable cause. A cause that would help our entire society, starting with our youth.

Is there any doubt that this would make millions happier and even save lives?

A better world is possible. Grounded in reality, not fiction.
