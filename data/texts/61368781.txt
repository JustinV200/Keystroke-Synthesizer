The question at hand is, what kind of effect do impressions and images have on you. Many seem to think it's all that matters. Today we will talk about the negative effects impressions have on us all.
I will always tell you that impressions from the internet ads or any ads will always affect a lot of people in different ways.I believe most are negative. Nothing good comes from following what we see and what we think the perfect life is. That is what ads do; they show you the perfect side of the product that most will never see. Also, that goes for the internet. You honestly never know what a person is actully living like. You only get a impression.
The reasons I believe the negtiave impact is if we look at the cultures of models. They are unrealsiticly skinny and one perecnt of pepole look like them. They put the thought of being skinny as what is to be seen as beautiful. Also, with that we see increase of young woman having eating disorders and their self esteem plumets. The same goes for ads. They give you this life of sandy beaches, clear waters, and a great time. To many people, that is not the case for them. So they drink and many get depressed and realize this product wont actually change ones life. I understand where many may say that ads or the internet models are changing, but the change is small. Changes may seem to make the difference to many, but there's plenty of work ahead to teach pepole that most you see on the internet or ads are just that a impression of thier life that they want you to see.
In conclusion, impressions will always be a problem for people. They will always want to be what they see. While we freely let the great life style of impressions to countinue, we will always have a negative affect on pepole who cannot live the lifestyle being shown to them daily. Impresions can motivate. Some will mostly make others feel as if thier life does not compare.
