i think it depends on the person. Some people don't like to socialize so they are happier with there personal goals.  Some are people persons and like to make others happy which in turn make them happy.
     Being happy can also in turn make you choose your profession.  If you like to make prople laugh you may be a comedian.  If you do not like being around people you may choose to be a night security guard and in turn work on your personal goals in hobbies yu have.  Whatever the case may be I believe it is an indvidual choose that people make.  Whether it be voluntary or involuntary choice.  may be by how you were raised or something that happened while you were young.  Sometimes destiny makes that choice for you.
      Whatever the choice it takes all different types of people to make the world go round.  Sometimes our destiny can be changed and our will power to change it is ours.  So all in all it is a choice and only you can make that choice and be comfortable with it.  You can look deep in your heart and decide what is best for you and go for it.
