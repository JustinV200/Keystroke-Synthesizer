       People can achieve more success by cooperation than competition.  Cooperation and competition can promote different work ethic ,but cooperation can make people more successful by not forcing a rivarly.

      Success can be achieved best through cooperation because people are not forced into rivarly where they feel pressured to be better than a co worker or a peer.   Cooperation can have long effects such as if kids in school can learn about cooperation they can keep the same work ethic throughout their life to help them through college and through their career.  Cooperation can have lots of benefits for people such as teamwork, support, and decision making.  Cooperation can lead to easier jobs when working together on a job because their are multiple people with different mindsets and jobs.  People can go to their jobs everyday knowing they can work with eachother to make a successful plan and not go to work the next day worrying they will not have the best plan than their other co-workers.  

Some people might argue that competition can lead to better success than cooperation.  Success can be driven my competition because people who want to be the best will be more competitive.  The richest people such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zucherburg all compete with eachother to have more money to be the richest.  Many successful celebrities always compete with eachother for the top spot on the charts.  Actors and actresses compete with eachother to get a role in the movie.   This is a great point, however competition can only work in certain situations to succeed.  Competition drives people to suceed ,but also promotes a unhealthy work ethic and environment.  

    As you can see cooperation can lead to more and longer success than competition.  Cooperation can benefit everyone at a workplace and promote a healthy work environment and ethic.
