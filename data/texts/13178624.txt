Happiness is a thing that almost every human being can relate to no matter for whom or the 'why' they are looking to obtain it. It is a goal that knows no bounds as many different things make individuals happy and the elements that create this joy in groups are amplified through many diverse tasks to experience it. Most people understand that pusuing their own measure of happiness is a necessity yet that same feeling of elation can blossom and move beyond themselves, such as musicians playing at concerts or the emotive responses actors seek to deliver during live theater, surely anyone who has been to a successful live performance knows the artist is happy through expressiveness and that that feeling spreads to those in attendance. Personal happiness can evolve and move out toward the surrounding community if it is relatable and agreeable and change things for the better.

There is the possibilty that that is all illusion, however. Individuals can appear to be happy and cheerfully spread their apparent joy but employ illusion in order to make others feel a sense of happiness that is meant to obfuscate and direct them to a adopt a particular stream of thought,  advance a hidden goal. Numerous people have seen such charlatans and been charmed by them yet it is observable that those who are made happy are so no matter what and that is the point really. Happiness pursuing one's own personal elation can benefit others at the monment and beyond the instant.

There are so many numerous examples of pursuing happiness that no one really needs examples. People by necessity need to feel happy if only as it makes the usual drudgery less abrasive, and if that trek to joy can be amplified outward to others than certainly there can be no harm, hopefully. People want happiness no matter the cost.
