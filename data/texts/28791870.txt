Throughout history, images and impressions have made made an impact on people. We can look back to historical artwork and statues to get a sense of what people valued back then. People are highly affected by imagery and impressions, to a fault. Especially in this day and age with an oversaturation of media, people get attached to the most attractive images and their perceived perception of them.

We can jump into any point in time and see the impact of imagery on humans. Visit any Christian church and you will likely see multiple depictions of Jesus and Virgin Mary. Sometimes it can be good and relatively harmless for people to get attached to certain imagery. Sometimes it can lead to a second World War as a country rallies together due to the words and image put into their heads of the perfect race. There's a reason why we now have people who research market analytics to figure out what types of advertisements will stick with the minds of the public. Some may think it is not a big deal, and that it takes a combination of factors to get something to stick. However, the most important aspect is the perceived image. Implant a image into people's minds and they will believe what you're selling and even spread the word to others.

Humans can be easily misled. Critical thinking isn't something inherent but a skill that has to be taught. All it takes is that first good impression for countless transgressions to be brushed aside later. The issue of imagery being too effective will never not be a problem. It is up to governing bodies to regulate so that harmful imagery and impressions from those with an agenda are not allowed.
