   Cooperation is the key to success in this fast paced, disparate world. If one relies merely on competition to succeed in life's tasks, outcomes may not be equitable for all concerned. Although competition may be the basis of this country's idea of success,  competition al0ne can lead to many being left behind due to unfair starting points.
   Competition leads to losers and winners. Not everyone can succeed using this model. If given a chance to share knowledge or ideas as a team, there does not have to be clear winners or losers. Everyone gets a chance to share what they know and learn from each other. Additionally, the idea of competition seems to exclude some, while others succeed. The very idea of competition pits one against the other. This is not optimal for success or personal growth. Working together can allow all to succeed.
   Some may say that a little healthy competition is good. However, who decides how much competition is needed? How does one know for certain that all will flourish in this type of environment? As a classroom teacher, I see this on a daily basis. There are many children who come to school with a large vocabulary, eager to share ideas, and express their views. However, not every child has this advantage. The quiet, shy student who is hesitant to speak up may someday become a leader if given the chance.  
  Cooperation is the only way to ensure that everyone is given a chance to participate in this world. No one's point of view should be more valued than another. By working together much more can be accomplished and the success of many will be more equitably assured.
