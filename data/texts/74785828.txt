In my front of view happiness is only happen when they do their goal. and if we do other goals it will make others happy but it wont statisfy ours mind happy. In my life i always believes my goals is very important for myself.
On other day i have done a good work for my company  but i felt so bad on that because i planned for better idea and i cant excute that plan so im not happy with that work but my collegues are very happy with it. This is an example that im accpet that our goal is make us happy.
There is so much people have shared their experinece with me that they sacrified many things for their family and friends that wont make them happy because it is not their intention to do that work its was forced by other to do.
If we planned to do something from out bottom of heart it will work one hounderd percent.but it was forced means im sure that it wont work to two hundred percent. last month i have done some workout plans to get fit i have made this goal with in two months and it was work and its make us feel very happy.
