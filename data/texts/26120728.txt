The topic to discuss here is whether people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition. Though the term 'Victory' is common to refer a winning situation, the fruits from the victory will be enjoyed either by an individual or a team. Lets discuss further in detail about this concept.
According to me, success can be achieved based on the situation. For example, if a project in a firm is to completed by a group of people which can be referred to as a 'Team' in a limited time, and they also accomplish it, then that success is celebrated a result of cooperation. In a running race, the success is achieved by the person is mainly based on his hardwork and dedication to that specific event. Achieveing success mainly depends on the hardwork a person puts in his work. 
Success by cooperation comes when people from different technical background join together to create a product. And success through competition comes when people are moving towards the same goal with similar eligibility criteria. Even though both concepts are different, people achieve more success by cooperation. Because even in running race though every person runs to achieve individually, previously they are trained by a trainer. A cooperation needed between a trainer and a student, so that the student can perform well in a competition.
