Materialism.  Way back in the 1980's, Madonna sang about being "living in a material world" and being a "material girl."  This concept was embraced by the teen generation at that time and I, as one of those teens, can say that even at my current age, I, too, am a material girl.  Even now, Lizzo will sing about her "LVs" and "Balenciagas" and then we all want to go out and find these items.

This concept or idea should not, in my humble opinion, be criticized.  Let's face it, a lot of people enjoy purchasing items and acquiring possession.  Is it not the most important factor in one's life, I believe, and we cannot take these possessions with us when we go, but over a span of decades, items, products, consumerism changes and, therefore, a change in material needs also occurs.  It's what drives the economy.  If no one wanted anything, what would happen then?  So yes, spending time and energy on purchasing and consuming items is not, in the grand scheme of things, the end all be all.  But, if we can find some enjoyment from being a little materialistic and we are not harming anyone, then what is the problem?

So let's face it, we all enjoy having this item and that gizmo.  It's not what's most important in life.  But having things we enjoy should not be a crime or be criticized.  Let's all embrace the materialistic side of ourselves every once in awhile and get that thing we've dreamed of and enjoy it while we are here. No, no criticisms of materialism from this author.  Time to go shopping now!
