Everyone wants to be successful in todays world. Many people have a long list of things they would like to accomplish, but what is the best way to achieve success? In my opinion the best way for people to achieve success is through cooperation! 

Cooperation helps individuals achieve the things they want in a more efficient way. With the help of others you will be able to gain more expertise in certain areas. They can help you learn new things. You may not be strong in some areas but the people you are working with may be experts in the area! When you cooperate with others you can lean on them for support. They can help build your confidence, and enhance your skills. You may even learn how to communicate with others in a better way. 

However, you may be able to achieve success through competing. When you are competing with others you learn to be very resiliant and bounce back from any failures you may have. When you are a person who likes to compete, you are very self reliant and will push yourself harder to get things done because you know that no one else is going to do them for you. Although you can achieve success alone, it should be achieved with the help of others and the benefits should be shared among everyone who cooperated.
