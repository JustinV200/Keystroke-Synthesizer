Icons in the media, such as celebrities, brands, and slogans have a huge influence on today's culture. The media is trying to shape everyone to think the same way, dress the same way, vote the same way, act the same way. The media has way too much effect on people in today's society.
Young kids, and even young adults, try to replicate things they see in the media...even if they are digitally augmented or straight up fake. They are trying to replicate things such as dressing the same, acting the same, doing the same things, traveling to the same places. This is causing our world to be less and less unique, as well as making everyone sheep. People should be more creative, and be able to think and act for themselves rather than trying to be someone they're not. They shouldn't try to be or do something that's not even REAL.
The media needs to pull back their reins of brainwashing and controlling. Our society is becoming further and further away from a Democracy. It is more like a dictatorship or communist society with the ways the media and the government are trying to control people and things in the way they advertise or suggest things. Sure, advertising your product or brand is good. But at what point does it become too much? I'll tell you...it's when everyone starts acting, dressing, and thinking the same. We don't need more of those brainwashed idiots and stupid influencers on social media. People need to think for themselves and make their own damn decisions based on how they truly feel, and who they are, and where they've come from. 
Today's media is poison to most of the population. We were better off before technology took over the world.
