Most of us are at least nominally aware of how we are impacted by the images we're bombarded with in advertising, social media, and media in general. Flashy images and subliminal messages abound, and it's all about money. 

Images and impressions that we are exposed to have an outsized impact on everyone, whether they want to admit it or not. The advertising industry has refined and honed their craft to a very sharp point, and they plunge it into our subconscious mind every time we look at a screen, billboard, or listen to the radio. 

You need only look around you to see this in action, though it sometimes takes a conscious step back to ask yourself, "What am I being sold here?" Whether it's sexual innuendo in advertising for erectile dysfunction pills, the implication that you're not a real man if you don't use X or Y, or you're never going to find a man if you don't wear this or that. 

Many of us think we have developed a filter for such things, but the only real way to escape the influence is not to be exposed to it in the first place. Nowadays this would almost require being a hermit and living far from civilization. Advertising is so ubiquitous that you can never really tell what is paid content, and what is actual unslanted information. With the profiles that have been built for almost everyone, you can almost be assured that you're receiving ads tailored to what the algorithms know is the best way to wring your dollars from you.

Images and impressions, both personalized and general, have a large and long-standing impact on people. Most go through life unaware that they're being manipulated.
