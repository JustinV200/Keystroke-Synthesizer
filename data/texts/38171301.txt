While in a world that everyone feels that they have to out do each other cooperation may actually be the key to success. Cooperation vs competition has been discussed throughout time, and people would argue one or the other. Cooperation though raises the success of not just themselves, but to those around them as well. Cooperation leads to much less stress as well which makes it easier to be successful.

Through cooperation people do not feel that that they have to deal with things on their own, and it makes it much easier to achieve success. Got a problem that you are hard dealing with? Cooperation allows one to get the proper help without the others feeling that they are being outdone. It is important to have this kind of thinking everywhere as not only it creates more success, but also lessens the stress.

Stress is a big factor in why competition is more detrimental to people. They are constantly trying to do better than the other to gain success, and it can lead to a lot of toxicity. Having to do things on their own makes it much harder then themselves as they do not feel that they rely on others. There is a lack of trust in a competition, and thus a lot less success.

There is many reasons why cooperations is much better for people then being in a competitive environment. Cooperations makes it easier to for people to work in. Working with others has a lot more positive like being able to work with others, and reducing a lot of stress. So do you want to live in a world where you feel like you must be on your own, or being able to work along with others to achieve success? I feel like that is an easy answer for many.
