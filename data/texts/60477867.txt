Do images and impressions have to much of an effect on people?

Images and impressions have a huge potiental to have a effect to people .
to go into the topic of impressions they can be first meeting or constant contact with a person or a animal.

Impressons can shape your character, emotions and outlook on life. the research that I have seen from mutiple sources suggest it effects our apperance, and how promiscuous and powerful people think you are.

Humans see images everyday and in every moment when we watch social media, watch tv and shop. Images help us learn, grab attention, and can insipre us .

It is important for us to determine the difference between how images and impressions can shape our precetion of reality. Paying attention to these images and impressions can lead us to inspire to be great or can ultimatelty lead us in not so great preceptions of reality.

All in all we must be able to look at these impressions and images in full entriety so we can indepedently fully and critcally understand what we are reacting to and what seeing and eating and interacting with as a whole . Instead of looking at somewthing at the surface and to just keep going As people in our current society we must be able to be rational and understanding of images and impressions
