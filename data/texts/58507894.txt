Cooperation is the key to success in business and in play. The old adage you can get more flies with honey than with vinegar reinforces this thought, and throughout history we've seen many examples of cooperation leading to better outcomes versus competition. First, cooperation leads to a quicker outcome than competition. Second, competition can lead to many worse results than cooperating as a group and even lead to fraud and crime committed in the name of competition. By working together versus competiting against one another, there is more likely to be a better overall outcome that helps both parties feel as though they have "won"
 
Cooperation tends to lead to faster outcomes than pure competition. When rivals come together to reach an effective outcome, less time is used and an outcome is reached more efficiently. The Cold War for example went on far longer than needed due to a lack of cooperation, and finally came to a halt after cooperation after many years of fierce rivalry between the US and Russia. The results also could have been worse, leading to nuclear fallout and death if it continued. Competition can also lead to cheating, fraud and other acts of crime, simply because one of the parties competing just "wants to win". All of the negative consquences of competing vs cooperating are ineffective in the longterm.

Ther are those that think competition is better. They think that competition leads to more innovation overall. While in some cases that may be true, it comes at a cost of wasted resources and time. 

In conclusion, it's simply more effective, efficient, quicker and less likely to cause negative results by cooperating versus simply competing. In the end, a world with more cooperation and less competition leads to better, faster outcomes for the world as a whole.
