In human society, changing and renewing ourselves to fit the general trend or modern culture is something that always exists and happens in us. Prominent among them are images and impression . This is really important bacause as we all know, the first thing we look at when we look at us is about our appearance, then later things like personality... Bulding yourself a beautiful images and impressions is very important, although there are limitations associated with it such as confusion with reality and different from what is advertised, but everything has two sides. It and this problem too. We ourselves are also important  in our own image, so it is important for a celebrity or the products of a company or organization to really promote beautiful, eye-catching, even though it is a little different. Make us mistaken with the outside reality, but it is really necessary to polish your name, create a hot product, get many aspects of profit, thinking, and point of view of each child. Those who care about it, even if it loses its inherent value, it is really necessary. In short, everything that works in this wold has both good and bad sides, we cant't have a complete answer as to whether it is right or wrong, depending on each person's point of view, for me personally the problem this is important and necessary despite the limitations mentioned above.
