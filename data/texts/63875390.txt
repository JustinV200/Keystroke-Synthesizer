Success is achieved by both competition and cooperation.  Examples of this theory are:

For instance, team games, be they for pleasure or professionally must have both factors of competition and cooperation to win a game.

Each player must cooperate with all other members of their team in order to "gain the upperhand," score points and avoid penalties and/or injuries.

Each player also must have a mindset of defeating the opposing team, therefore, competing against them to score points and win the game for their team.

If there are players on a team who are "out for themselves" and not cooperating with their teammates, the team runs the risk of suffering due to the selfishness of their teammates.  

This is also true in the world of business.  

When businesses are engaged in selling the same product, each business must have employees who see themselves as a team, cooperating to produce the best product they can.  The best product is, of course, very attractive to buyers/investors.  Every business wants to attract buyers/investors to stay successful. 

Businesses know full well that they must innovate and imporove their products consistently in order to "beat" the competition and prove to buyers/investors that their products are what the consumer wants, without a doubt.  

Businesses also must encourage cooperation among their employees by treating them as valuable assets.  A content employee will want to do their best for their employer, therefore making the employer successful.

In conclusion, my belief is success is achieved by BOTH cooperation and competition.  It takes the right people in positions which suit them to succeed.
