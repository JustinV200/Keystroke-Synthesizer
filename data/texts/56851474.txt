Materialism. It's one of the few things that makes us more than just animals, the desire to acquire and own things. It's an unfortunate reality that doing so is one of the ways society as a whole judges people, but it's also very real that in this day and age, we've moved beyond just a want for materialistic things. These days, need is just as important.

A large number of people live beyond their means in their attempts to grow their material gain, but an even larger number simply need it to survive. The simple things in life that were once taken for granted, such as housing, cars, furniture, even clean water and food in some cases, are capitalized on to make money off these people who are in need, and even made to think that when they do manage to fight through the capitalism and failures of society to gain the materialistic things they need, we make them think that it's not enough and they want more.

These people should not be shamed, for simply desiring things that so many others take for granted. What should instead be criticized is the society that makes healthy food, a place to call home, clean water, and many other necessities out to be materialistic things to consume, and not what people should have as a standard quality of life. We should criticize the society that does shame people for not being able to move beyond just the necessities, while working to actively keep people from doing so. 

Realistically, people say that money can't buy happiness, but it is in fact one of the biggest sources of happiness in the world, simply because it allows people to provide for themselves, their families, and their loved ones, reducing stress and increasing the quality of life they would live.
