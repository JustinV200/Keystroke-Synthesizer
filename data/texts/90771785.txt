Achieving success is closely related to competition because of the need to surivive and thrive. Cooperation, while important, is not nearly as important when it comes to achieving success as competition. Competition is inherently intwined with success as it forces people to prove that they are better at the task at hand than the opposition. The thought of being a failure enters peoples minds and makes them do whatever it takes to succeed.
When competing, people will pull out all of the stops and push themselves to achieve success. In cooperation, people have to make reservations, take on a lesser role, or even abandon their stance to preserve the groups idealogy. This can lead to a less successful outcome as people do not have to show the same passion, drive, and desire to be the best. Working with, or relying on, others makes people less aggressive towards the goal of being successful because they can always shift blame or work onto others.
When competing by themselves and not worrying about cooperation, people strive to achieve success because the only other route is failure. To avoid failure while competing, people must think outside the box and work to be better than the opposition. This simply is not the case when cooperating because people are not soley responsible for the success or failure of the task.
