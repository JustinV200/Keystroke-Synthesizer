We would all like to think that cooperation and teamwork are the greatest motivators, but that just is not the truth. Better results are obtained through strongly encouraged and strictly regulated competition. People competing to be the best almost always causes the best outcome for thier endeavors. This seems to mirror the animal kingdom where animals compete with resources so the strengest get the furthest ahead.  

It could be argued that America is founded on this competion. Competition for work, competition for business, even competition for educational opportunities (in the form of grades and standardized test results). The best get the best through being the best in competition with one another for whatever they find themselves working towards. Competition for customers through marketing is reallly how people seem to really get ahead in business. We start competition young, even our 3 and 4 year old compete in sports with T-ball. All through our high school years we compete in sports and formal academic competitions.

This is all not to say that cooperation is not the best way to accomplish a competitive edge. Teams compete but players frequently cooperate in order to present the strongest competition. I guess even in my basic position there is room for a competent argument for cooperation within competition. So which is it? Is it competition through cooperation or cooperation to foster competion? I guess I believie it this the latter rather than the former.

But in the end competition and the competitive drive work together for the best overall possible outcomes. Where the best win we see a sort of form of social evolution where the best survive and the people who aren't quite the best fail to progress. In the end, the best float to the top while the worst fall to the bottom. I guess, survival of the business as it were? Survival of the fittest? I think this is how we do so well financially as a people in this world.
