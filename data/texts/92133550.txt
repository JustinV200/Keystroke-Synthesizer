In today's world, we are pressured to be the best at a particular thing. We actually extend our  education by specializing in certain areas of a working field to get a leg up on our competition. The problem with this is that companies are looking for people who can work together to produce the best idea.

I read an article, posted a couple of years ago, on what  a competitive company like Google was looking for to add to their fleet. It surprised me to read that the most important thing they were looking for was someone who could work with other people. It was not their GPA, or their accolades, it was the ability to build on someones ideas, and help them grow to an even better one. When I started researching different companies, this was one of the questions that was discretely hidden in their opening questionnaire. Obviously there are plenty of companies that are looking for groups that can work well with one another. They realize that this leads to a more successful environment.

Cooperation is obviously needed in certain areas of our work force, but I am sure that other companies believe that a little competition will show who the real front runners are in their fields. I think the benefits are both can be shown depending on what area they are working in.
