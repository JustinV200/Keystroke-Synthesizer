Materialism, some say our society takes it to far. That we have lost focus on the important spiritual aspects of life. But without materialism life would become stagnant. It is materialism that drives society.

It is the desire of acquiring possessions that help drive society. Where would be if a rich oil barron didn't want to buy his beautiful wife a diamond ring? No oil would be discovered and society would then grind to a halt. People pursure educations in order to make more money and buy various items. New inventions and discoveries are made all the time because someone wants to get rich.

Money, money, money, we all want it. And we need it as a society. It is what we use to exchange goods and services. Without money and the desire to obtain it, our system would fall apart and we would be forced to become barbarians without it. It keeps the system of exchanging goods and service fair. No one wants to live in a world without a system of trade. And it is materialism that keeps that system going.

Maybe we do take materialism to far, with our constant consumerism and materialistic society. But the constant acquiring of possesssions and spending of money keeps our society afloat and fuels progress. We shouldn't criticize materilism, we should embrace it.
