People seek happiness in their lives. Is it possible to be happy only when pursuing our own dreams and personal goals or is personal happiness found when focusing on the happiness or other people or making the world a better place for others?

It is the writers belief that personal happiness is found when those around us are happiest. People are happiest when they are involved in creating a better environment or situation for others and are engaged in a way that is not self indulgent and only thinking of themselves. 

Most people want to take care their family and friends and their community. In doing so the experience happiness becuase they have had an impact that results in benefits for all, including themselves. By making sure their family has things that they want, they are motivated to continue to provide more for them and improve their lives. They receive positive feedback in the form of love and caring from those they care for. In caring for their community, they make others happy and those people in turn take care of their own family and give back to the community resulting in a better situation for all.

It can be said that in caring for others and not focusing on onself can lead to feeling used up and burnt out. If a person focuses on themselves and acheiving their goals, they will have more to give to others at a later date because they are self-fullfilled and happy. On the other hand, reaching goals only for oneself is selfish and may not make a person happy. If a person only focuses on themselves, they may not care for others along the way to personal success. They may give up famiy relationships, love and emotional comfort and be empty and never reach happiness. 

Happiness will be found when people are mostly involved in caring for others and the happiness of others and improving society.
