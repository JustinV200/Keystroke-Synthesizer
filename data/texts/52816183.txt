Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? Personally, I have fun being in competition and have more chance of succeeding if its a game environment. For example, playing tug of war or volleyball with few friends. When it comes to competion at work, I dislike the idea and even dismissed joining. I'd rather have cooperation and team work.

I believe in the West, competition is sometimes a healthy playing field for companies to make their tangible product better and more appealing to consumers. In the field of customer service, cooperation is best suited to be applied.Otherwise, without cooperation, people will less likely stay in their job since  servicing clients involve other departments and position to get the loyalty and appeasement of a client. 

Competition is certainly can be harmful in sectors such as car dealership and
 furniture or commission based field. Due to workers trying to hit their goal or obtain sales, sometimes they steal each other clients that can be very detrimental to someones over all mental and health being. A stolen client, who may have brought 3k commission for someone is certainly can bring hurt and distrust with the company and w/ colleague if not corrected.
