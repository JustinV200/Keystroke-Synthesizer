Which is more important, content or appearance? That is a concept that is often debated and discussed. 

One can have high-quality content, not a good appearance and will not get the attention they deserve and will often be overlooked.  Good appearance is crucial to get the second look that shows high-quality content.

Go to a store and you will see that the items are presented to persuade customers to buy them. Items can be high quality but if they don't look appealing, they can easily be overlooked. If an apple looks attractive in the store, it is more likely to be purchased than one that doesn't look as good. Looking good gets the second look.

Not convinced? In the U.S Army, soldiers know that it is best to wear their uniform neatly, stay in shape, and have highly polished boots. Why? Because if you look like an outstanding soldier, people will believe you are even if you are not as proficient as you look. It gives you an advantage that is hard to overcome. You will get the benefit of the doubt. 

So, the best way to proceed is to ensure high quality content but also make sure it looks good. If not, high quality content may never get the chance to show it.
