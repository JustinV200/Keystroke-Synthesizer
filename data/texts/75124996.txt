Superbowl commercials can go for over $1,000,000 for a 30 second ad and companies gladly pay it every single year. Companies will sponser the halftime performance. Busniess logos are plastered on the field and sidelines. Companies will engage in bidding wars for the naming rights of the stadium. Millions of dollars are spent in advertising for a three-hour football game. Why? Because it works. 

People can be incredibly impressionable and easily swayed by what they've seen. A commerical can influence a person to ask their doctor for a certain medication, without knowing or understanding much about it. People will go to a fast food restaurant after seeing delicious food on TV, only to receive a product that looks nothing like the TV showed. Images and impressions can impact what we buy, what we do, and what we believe. 

Some may say that images and impressions do not impact their life, which could be true for many. However, billions if not trillons of dollars are poured into advertising every year. If it were not successful, companies would not continue to put money into advertising. People are so influenced by what they visually consume. 

It is important that companies recognize the power that their images hold, as it can greatly impact their viewers. People can be manipulated, whether they know it or not, to act the way that advertisers want. It is also important that viewers recognize that the companies that produce the images typically have their own best interests in mind, and to not allow companies to influence their behavior.
