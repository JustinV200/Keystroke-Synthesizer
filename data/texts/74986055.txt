     Why do we go to work and why is so important to us? Going to work and getting paid for that work is a major part of everone's life in our culture. Because it is so vital it also can produce some push back from some people in our society.  And there may be some validity to that argument. Are we too materialistic?

     I would assert that it is not wrong to be concerned about material possessions and the role they play in our lives and that this attitutude is not harmful. In some ways this attitude can help strengthen other areas of our lives which are not material, such as our faith and family.

     We must provide for our family, and this requires that we are involved with the material world. A job is how we earn money to buy food and shelter. These are vital if we are to survive. And to provide for our retirement can take worry and concern away from our childern when we are older. To provide all these things we have to be involved with materialism.

     Some would say that we should only be concerned about our faith and family. Take a vow of poverty and only be concerned about the nonmaterialistic world. But if everyone took that stand, who would have resources to contibute to churches or donate money to help people who cannot help themselves?  It sounds noble to say we should only be concerned about the material things of the world, but this is not a practical way to live for most of us.

     Yes, we can be too concerned too much about the material world. But we can also not be concerned enough. Even the Bible says if a person will not work, then they should not eat. A person can be so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good. So being concerned abut material possions does not mean we are too materialistic.
