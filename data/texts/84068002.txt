Happiness is something which don't come easily to everyone. Some will get by their achievements and some will get by conceiving their close one's success.

According to me happiness is not the calculative measure of the achievement that he/she is going to achieve in their desired goal. It is irrespective to the size of the goal either it is larger or smaller because it is something comes when you achieve something that you longed for., So the measure is not important here but the achievement.

Now let's discuss about the question of that happiness comes by focusing on personal goals or focusing on other's success.

Actually achieving the personal goals by focusing on it for an ample amount of time and achieving it atlsast is not an easy task it requires a strict discipline and potential. If you drive this for all the period while at the time of travelling towards your goal then it is possible to obtain it, many people lags here . So we should never underestimate nor critice the person who achieves his/her personal goal. In the same time getting happiness by looking other's achievment is too not an easy task because not everyone will get the character of making other's success in this world. 

So according to the above statement people get happiness on both perosnal and other's happiness too.
