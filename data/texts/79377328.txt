How do you think people achieve more success? Would you say with cooperation, or with competition? I, myself, love a little bit of competition to make things fun, but cooperation and working as a team gets things done without conflict. 

Competition is a fun way to pass the time while getting things done. I love making a competion out of something that is usually boring and lame whether it be at my job, or at home with my daughter. I know making chores into time races gets her cleaning in no time, while making the chores more like a fun game than a chore. Cooperation is a nice, friendly way to quickly get things done. There's nothing that a strong team can't do when they have good team work. It sets a great mood and motivates everyone to keep doing better. 

Yes, there are those ones who are poor sports in every competition that takes the competion a little too seriously and can take out all the fun. It's good to know the right time and place and people to compete with for competitions to be a positive and effective way to motivate a team. And yes, there are always those ones that don't want to cooperate with their team making it harder for everyone else. But when you got a good, strong team that knows how to cooperate they will effectively pick up that slack because nothing slows down good team work. 

So, if you really think about it, competition and cooperation are both very important and effective ways to achieve success. To be able to have a team who knows how to cooperate all while having a little competitive fun is a team that will no doubt be unstoppable on their path to success.
