      Many people wonder in life, what makes us happy? Is it other people's happiness or is it our own happiness that makes our lives fulfilled? Well, to me it is a little bit of both! As we get older in life, most of us find a comfortable place in this universe where we are confident in who we are and what we do, and carry on our own families. However, we sometimes wonder how did we get there? The answer is truly simple, we planned a goal and that goal was achieved, even if it wasn't planned as we all know that sometimes different circumstances change our plans and ideas, but then we think of an alternate solution, subconsciously planning our goals for our new lives ahead without even thinking about it! 

    Once we find our comfortability in life, we start to branch out into caring about not only ourselves but other people as well and we realize we start to care about many more things. Therefore, the next step to a truly happy life is our families. Even if its just a significant other, or adding children into our lives their happiness also carries a happiness within our hearts so, even if we are not necesarrily happy in that moment but the ones we care about are, sometimes that is all that it takes to truly bring out our happiness.  It's not just our lives and our loved ones that matter when it comes to true happiness, it also relies on our environment, social interaction, and many other things that can justify in happiness.

   In conclusion, when we wonder what makes us happy  in life, it can mean many different things to many different people. Weither it is social happiness, goals, family, jobs. Is happiness a feeling of joy? A way of life? A fullfillment of achieveing your goals? What does happiness mean to you?
