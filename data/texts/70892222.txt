The question of whether people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition  is capable of generating a very interesting argument because both processes have been shown to yield positive and negative results throughout history. Both cooperation and competition are necessary processes in this wide world. Competition often gives birth to new ideas while cooperation ensures the breakthrough is put into action.  
    What drove the pharoahs of Egypt to the forge the construction of the pyramids? This   was certainly the cooperative work of many who divided the  project into individualized tasks,  forming the blocks from the native soil and water,  transporting them to the site, and  hoisted up and perfectly mortared into position.  A similar modern example would be Henry Ford's assembly line brainstorm, with the pieces of car advancing through teams of workers, the last ones probably placing a shine on the new automobile as the finishing touch.
    The pyramids,  even today stand as evidence of inventive scientific and religious cultural representation.  Ford's idea certainly brought about competition, his successful enterprise eventually putting horses out to pasture and giving rise to the various companies pursuing new mode of travel, comfort, and safety.
   Both competitona and cooperation are necessary and efficacious.
