 Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?

             For this question i stongly agree the point by competition because i think can increase productivity of  an individual on both sides if there was a competition they actually work faster and their thinking capacity will increase gradually. 

             While on a competition they dont have much time so they will perform  fast and efficient some times they both can give a respectable results to help not only the company it will also helps to gain their individual experience and knowledge on the given time their creativity by the other way with the support of others can decrease yout learning capacity because the atmosphere there can be unpredictable it was based on the the group of people who are with the person some times they can be optimistic sometimes they cant and the supporters are not all the same and we have to respect theit time also for being a part of a team the person act as a team will always has to be dependent on others it will affet thir creativity and theit capacity of doing the tasks on the given time.


          So i would like to suggest one can  individually with a competior can gradually increase your productivity and the other one also so i can strongly reccomend to work with a competition.
