     Does it make a person happier to be happy or see others happy. So doing things for other people makes a lot of people happy.  I know for a personal fact that I enjoy doing things for others but when it comes to the end what really  makes one happy to do what they want to do or see others happy.
     So does it come down to is a person more of a extrovert or introvert. If a person is a extrovert they would be happier if one helps others. If they are a introvert they will focus on themselves and no one else. I believe that more people are extroverts because I read that people need so much time communicating with others so they have a healthy life. I know that I started as a accountant many years ago and then became a server and just the last couple years ago I was a CNA. I feel that most people think that CNA is a disgusting job however, it was the most statisfying job I could ever had. It made my whole life fullfilled because I was helping others and it made me feel good inside. Also look at the type of most jobs people do the majority of them help people do something.
     So to make my final point I believe that it makes people more happy to help others and get a more fullfillment out of life. I have learned this throughout life and I am glad I did. If I would have stayed just in accounting I wouldn't have had the chance to work with other people and learn how full filling it is to work with people and make them happy.  This is a basic need for the human being to be wanted and needed in life and one is helping others be happy.  So when one sees others happy it makes one reach there ultimate goal and that for me comes from helping others.
