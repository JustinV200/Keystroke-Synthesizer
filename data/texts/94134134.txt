Appearances of a regular joe that wouldn't rush someone with an image that serves their career would make them unhappy in the long run if that is what they choose to lean on in their life. Knowing that this is what you use to share thoughts and your work life with people can make you frustrated and seek a sense of well being in your life. This shouldn't place too much pain on a person. Don't let it overrun your life at all.

Ability on what should be more heavily relied upon in the long run. When a low point comes down to the work that you can do, who would place more sense on the thought that you could be able to do something more profitable rather than having a way of looks. Who cares what you look like if you aren't able to make a difference in anything that you do. Rather, focus on learning new skills instead whenever you go out into the world and are surrounded by other people. This can be one of the things that will help you as you go on in life when you know that you would not have any trouble doing what you enjoy and are able to make things happen in a way that can capture your passion in an every day life and workplace, filled with all of the little hobbies and intricacies that you may enjoy in a life.

The way that you appear may matter to some people, but it should not matter in everything that you do wherever that you go. You would not want to be kept in place by whatever you look like, just because some one has favor for that individual thing. Don't place too much of an importance on a look unless you would like to have a life that is vain throughout, with no or almost nonexistant of any true meaningful relationships to be in. I think that meaningful relationships make guys apt to prosper in the long run.
