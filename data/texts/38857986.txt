The concept of happiness is something that has been pondered by humanity since its origins. What makes a person truly happy? Of course happiness is going to be reached in different ways by different people but what is the "secret formula" to happiness? Let's consider two ways people feel happy; helping themselves and helping others.

When people help themselves they experience a certain type of happiness. Everyone likes to help themselves, but does it feel as good or as fulfilling as helping others? I think that depends on the type of person you are. Some people may find much more joy focusing on their career or family versus donating money to help others in need. This is not necissarily a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with wanting to better your life and experience happiness.

Other people may not feel as much happiness from acheiving personal goals. These people prefer to donate their time and money to others that aren't as fortunate in life. I think these people understand that helping others is necessary for the world to thrive. Some examples of these types of people are charity founders, philanthopists, and volunteers. I believe that these type of people are generally happier than most others.

So what makes a person truly happy? Well, I think it all comes down to thy type of person you are. Whether it is working hard to achieve a promotion at work, or volunteering weekends at the soup kitchen, we all have ways to find and feel happiness. Ultimately, I believe that people that want to focus on the happiness of others have found a deeper connection to their path to happiness. Helping others makes both them and the other person happy. This means there is more happiness spread than just a person focusing on themselves.
