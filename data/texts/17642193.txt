Materialism is the the incesant desire to aquire items or obtain wealth. For better or worse mankind has displayed this need since the dawn of man, it is simply a part of us.

It can be said that materialism is human nature. We are, at our core, a prideful species. There was a time it was a matter of showing off to show status within a tribal setting, to show acomplishments and success to others within the tribe. At its core even now this primal urge to show off remains within us, although the ways and reason have changed this is human nature. That is something that will never change. After all, if you work hard to achieve or acquire something why not flaunt it some. Be proud!!

The other side of the coin is that these urges sometimes can drive a person to ruin. In modren times people have unrealistic expectations of themselves and goals to lofty to achieve. With this excessive goals they almost always fall short leading them to feel as failures, despite other sucesses. People also will push themselves into financial ruin to masquerade as being more successful than the true reality. It is also worth noting that in many religions such behavior is seen as sinful.

I feel as though, like most things in life, that moderation and balance are needed. To work 80 hours a week to own a sports car is foolish as is having a sports car but not be able to buy food. But if one wants a sports car they can still get it, in time, with responsable spending. Is materialism bad? It really depends on the situation, it can be but it can also be a positive. Goals are important to most people and the sports car example could be such a goal. 

One should only be criticized if their materialism reaches an excessive, obsession level but this is not an one size fits all solution. What is excessive and unhealthy to me might not be to you. I preach moderation but yet enjoy the things that you want and make you happy!
