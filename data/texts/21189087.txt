The pathway to success is never easy, some people frames the way to success as a process of competition, that you must outperform others to reach your goal, other people, however, claims that cooperation is fundamentally embedded in the process of achiving success. My point is, cooperation is more needed in order to achive a significant lasting goals especially in today's complex world. 
People should recoginize the limitation of single person's power and knowledge when trying to reach an outstanding goal, especially in today's world, where networking is a key to management and allocation of resources. Therefore cooperation would amplify personal strength and talent and makes it easier to achieve your goal. It's never possible for a single person to come up with a complicated goal like designing the next iPhone, which can only be made possible by cooperation between hundrends of computer scientists. 
People who value competition may get lost in their way to reach success, that is they might choose extreme methods in order to win the competition that would not only harm other people but damage their reputation as well, which would lead to their social death and prevent them to further their goals in the future.
It's widely acknowledged that both competition and cooperation are needed in terms of reaching your goals, however, cooperation is more important when comes to achiving for a complicated and significant goal in a complex world today.
