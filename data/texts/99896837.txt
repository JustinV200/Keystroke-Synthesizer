Materialism is often looked down on today's society, and in my opinion, rightly so.   A materialistic life is trite and devoid of real meaning, as it is almost impossible to acheive real contentment with this way of life.  There will always be more and more to buy, and the need will never be completely satisfied.  This also contributes to a society where people care less about other people and more about possessions, which leads to a narcissitic and cold society.    

Is there a place for materialism in today's modern world?   It is certainly fine to want certain specific things and to strive to obtain them, but you need to make sure to balance this with truly meaningful things in life like relationships, experiences, and pursuing betterment every day.  This is the way we as a nation and as a world can continue to move forward and move the human race into further enlightenment.  Our current materialistic focus just keeps the world running on corporations putting us all through the meat grinder to earn the money to keep buying and buying and buying.  It is not only unsustainable, but damaging to us socially, psychologically, and spiritually.

I feel that a purpose driven life in which we help each other is the ideal.   I would much rather everybody has their basic needs met than billionaires having one more yacht.    I wish everyone felt the same, particularly those with the resources to make a real difference.  Greed and self-centeredness is killing the human race.    I can only hope we can turn it around and make a recovery before it it too late.  I hope others can appreciate this sentiment as well and we can move forward with a kinder, more loving, and more open world and not one of selfish materialism and greedy behavior.
