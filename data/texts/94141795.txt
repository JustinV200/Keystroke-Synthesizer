The answer for the question that is whether people more likely to be happy if they focus on their own goals or on the happiness of others is that depends upon the people or the situation. In my point of view let we see both individually. First we can see about focusing on one's own goal. First about own goal. When we focus on our own goal we can get happiness because the only reason is that is our goal and achievement. This may be seems to be selfish but it is not because it is very important to focus on our own goals.
                    Next we can see about happiness of others. This literally means humanity. When we focus on happiness of others it denotes the happiness of  ours because everytime we cannot be selfish we should focus on happiness of others. Others in the sense the people other than us, whoever may be. This may be ur parents, friends, relatives, neighbours and so on. So it is also very important.
            My answer for the question asked in the beginning as I said both are very important to take into consideration. As said Aiming at something other that their own happiness, they find happiness along the ways is very true and also focusing on happiness of others also important because that increase the humanity.
