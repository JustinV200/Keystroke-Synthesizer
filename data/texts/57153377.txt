                         Materialism is the thing which is predominant in this modern society. Materialism is prevelant everywhere. No matter, whether you are rich or poor, salaried or unworked, educated or uneducated, everybody in this modern world wish to own money and possessions some or more depending on their life style and situations.

                         Sticking to materialism has become a kind of sticking to one particular social stigma. One cannot fully deviate or distract themselves from being materialstic. Each and every individual born in this world has one or few wishes, dreams or goals to achieve. To make it true, they need money. With that money, they can live happily with their own comforts by fulfilling their own necessities and their family needs.

                         Being materialstic is nothing wrong unless and until it hurt others or destroy other lives. One should seek money or possessions only to fulfill their needs, benefits, dreams and goals but should not be too greedy to grab everything they see and touch. Being materialtic is not at all worse unless and until one becomes selfish and lose their generosity. To say it frank, the one who love acquiring lot of money and possessions to their goals, family needs, kid's future - also should be ready to help others who are really in need with their saved materialistic things. That symbolise them as "a real human being." Thus, being materialstic isn't wrong in this modern, advanced, expensive world unless and until you lose your "humanness".
