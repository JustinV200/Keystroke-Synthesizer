Life is brief. We appear to believe that we will live indefinitely. We spend tome and money as though we'll never leave. We buy flash goods as though they are important and worth the debt and anxiety of attachment. Because we all feel we have another year, we postpone the so-called ''vacation of a life time''.
   We don't tell our loved ones how much we care enough because we expect there will always be tomorrow. and we terrified. we stay in bad professions and situations because we're terrified of the consequences of leaving. we don't go as high or as far as we should because we're afraid of failing, forgetting- or never discovering- that it's better to try than to fail.
    We believe we have an infinite amout of time and that our worries are insignificate. we are preoccupied with the trivial to the exclusion of the most valuble asset we possess: moments we will never see again. we talk about passing the time, killing time, and getting through the week. but we forget that we are wishing away the moments that make up our existence. we say time is money. yet time is the only thing we have. Money may be borrowed, but not time. We are afraid of taking risks, oblivious to the reality that playing it safe means we will not live as long as we expect and will never achieve our goals. it is then too late. We battled whil watching our favoirte TV shows...
             So ''Life's best things aren't things.'' This simple yet profound statement deserves much more attention. We all live in a materialistic society where the majority of people care more about what they own that who they are.
                                                                   
                                                              THANK YOU.
