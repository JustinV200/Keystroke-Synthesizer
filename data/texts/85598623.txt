            Everyone born to succeed in their life. Face many things during lifetime and put lot of effort to achieve great height. The success get in a two ways. One is think everything be a competition, other one is being in a group success. Both are important to success untill harm to anyone.
            This is competitive world. We are in a race like runners. See everything competition is a habit of our life. For example In our childhood we compare our grade with other children. If we are in low we put many efforts to the top position. We experience this once in a lifetime. Making competitors give more power to achieve our goals. This is not mean once selfish. He is more concentrate in achieve his goal by eleminating all little enjoyments in life.This is a one kind of people. The another kind likes group victory. In this they win and also helps their companions. This makes a healthy and wealthy environment. This is one kind of maturity level of human.If everyone understand this concept the world will like a magis world.
            In my opinion both are equal part in everyone success. Get success by competition is a gentle one untill it harm to anyone. Get succcess by group give many good qualities like helpful, kind, adjustment and  supportive enviroment.
