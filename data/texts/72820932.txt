People are more likely to be happy if they focus primarily on their personal goals and aspirations, as opposed to focusing solely on the happiness of others or the improvement of humanity. There are a multitude of reasons why a focus on personal goals is more beneficial for happiness and fulfillment than purely altruistic motivations.

To illustrate, an individual focusing on their own dreams and pursuing their personal goals is more likely to be rewarded and reap the benefits of their eventual accomplishments. These benefits include a sense of fullfillment, pride, and individualism which are integral components of the bigger picture of happiness. While some may argue that a focus on other people's happiness could be equally rewarding, that can quickly lead to empathy burnout which has many negative consequences. Realistically, a focus on one's personal goals and dreams should be integrated with a healthy balance of contributing to others' happiness in order to achieve the ideal outcome.

Ultimately, a primary focus on personal goals and aspirations is certainly a greater contributor to one's happiness than a focus on the happiness of other people or the improvement of humanity. This focus is more grounded in reality and more feasible to lead to personal rewards and exponential growth.
