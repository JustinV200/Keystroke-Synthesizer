Before parting with your money, think what is really important about the purchace you wish to make. You look at the advertisement and get caught up in the excitement that it tries to create. Don't let someone else's endorsement cloud your thinking.
A lot of time, money and effort has gone into persuading you to buy. Stop and think if this is really a necessary purchase. Is it going to add meaning to your life. Are you just acting on a spur of the moment impulse. You have to realize that they are probably more interested in making the sale then you might possible want their offering.
The point that I am trying to make is that the advertising you are inundated with wants to control you. If you allow them to create a demand for this, that and the other, you will find yourself collecting way too many objects than what is needed. 
Try and make sure that what you think you want is something that you really need. Look for quality and don't be swayed by programed style. Try and live with the fewest and most fulfilling items. Please don't fall into the trap that I need more than what I really need to consume.
And please remember that a paid celebrity doesn't know more about you than what you know matters most.
