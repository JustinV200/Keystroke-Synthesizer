To answer the question of whether if modern society should be criticized for being materialistic, one must understand the reason to why modern society is fueled with the endless consumption of materialistic goods. Since the industrial revolution all the way to post modern WWII era, society was slowly being introduced & classified as the consumer class, which ultimately paved the way for corporations & businesses to obtain massive growth & enable a capitalistic society.

Once the industrial revolution was full at its peak of its cycle, businesses were able to output & produce more good with the help of factories. This supply of goods aided in a birth of consumer demand with the help of business advertisements & the early era of marketing. After post WWII era, the propaganda that assisted in war efforts slowly evolved to an early form of marketing, which companies adopted to help push their products to the masses. With the development of technology, products such as the radio & television helped bring products to the plethora of consumers; the main consumers being families across their respective nations. This endless cycle of marketing efforts to consumer demand resulted in businesses capitalizing on the growth of consumer spending. The revenue earned would be reinvested in marketing efforts that would fuel the endless cycle.

It is apparent that acquiring possessions & spending money makes a person feel good. It is even more apparent that some entities would want to take advantage of this fact and it has shown how successful some businesses have been from the demand & growth of consumer spending. When one asks whether modern society should be criticized for being materialistic, it must be considered how society evolved to this current state of consuming more & more each decade.
