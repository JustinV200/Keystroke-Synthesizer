people can achieve success by both cooperation and by competition but cooperation dives success to everyone,but competiton makes one success and others failure. it is hurting someone and encouraging another person . but cooperation gives a group of people to understand each other and communicate with one another and also becoming support of one another gives more success. if one person has doubt and another one clarifying it, it makes successful completion of wort by cooperating with each other in competition people donot share(or) discuss things between them, they have only thought to win the others
success mainly depends upon knowledge and capability of doing the work in cooperation, if one person has less knowledge the other team members support them and give the person some ideas to improve his knowledge and makes everyone be successful in completing the work. but in competition , it underestimate one's knowledge with other, it also reduces his will power to achieve success. But in cooperation, people motivate each other to achieve success and encourage one another.
according to my personal thoughts, people can achieve more and more success only by cooperation not by competition. compatition also best way to achieve success but cooperation is better than competition.
