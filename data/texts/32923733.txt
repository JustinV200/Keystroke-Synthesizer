In today's age, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Why?  Because people are impressionable and they rather have companies or influencers tell them what to do, how to think, and how to live.  People do not take the time to examine, evaluate, or verify that everything in life there is balance that when there is good, there is also bad. This is due to the fact that they want to be part of the "movement" or part of the "cool" crowd and ultimately, this is how they were told or advised to do.

For example Kim Kardishians and the rest of her family.  They are "beautiful", they are famous, they are glamous, they have other famous friends, and they live the rich lifestyle.  They have a TV show where millions of people watch them and is interested in their lives. People see the large houses, the expensive cars, the shining jewelries, the fashionable clothes, and they see the endless shopping, eating out, and spending money. These are all adverisements; ads that is aimed at people who watches the show.  People see these things and admire the Kardishians, tries to emulate them, and want the same type of lifestyle. However, they don't know the behind the scenes where they can see them and their faces without the make up, without the camera effects, and without the acting. 

There are people that are fools and truly believe these lies and deceptions. They truly believe that type of lifestyle is real, obtainable, and will bring them happiness. This is because they accepted and allowed that type of images and impressions to have strong effects in their minds. In today's age, images and advertisement has one  purpose and one purpose only:  To have people spend money buying.
