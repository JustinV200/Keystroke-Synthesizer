Materialism is a modern day fact of life for many people. Some think they have to have the latest and greatest and others think they need to keep up with the Joneses. Take for instance in the fashion business there are many hot and expensive designs from the likes of Versache or Michael Kors. People think they just have to have it. 

My position is I for one feel that I dont need every hot item off the shelf or need to keep up with the Joneses. This type of materialism along with other examples aren't my style. It is wasteful. I believe modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.

Take for example materialistic clothing, gadgets, electronics, automobiles, and other array of daily items. You can use what you already own. Go shop your closet for clothes. Too much clothing ends up in landfills all because some folks need the newest fashion. Gadgets like the kind you see on infomercials let me ask, do you really need all this junk when you most likely have the same or a alternative that works just as good. Computers are another item or cell phones. Seems they push for you to upgrading and buying this years version. Not a thing wrong with what you already have mind you. When again these same items end up in landfills or sourced out to other countries like India where they burn some of it and it creates bad pollution.

The clothing and electronic industies want you to buy buy buy and spend spend spend. They claim it creates jobs. That it also keeps you modern. They make more and more and it ends up polluting our earth. This is the cost to all of us. Climate change is real and not only endangers our coast lines and islands and every day weather patterns it can also can harm our health.

In conclusion being materialistic is not a good thing. More harm is done by being this way in more than one way as I have outlined in my paragraphs. Thank you for reading and next time you think you need to go buy think first.
