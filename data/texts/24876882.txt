Material items make people happy. People use birthdays, holidays and any other special meaning in a day to gift loved ones items, and the loved one may end up cherishing that item. I do not think it is a bad thing to be materialistic. Companies all over the world create goods for materialistic reasons, and people purchase those items for a reason, that is not a bad thing. I do not believe that modern society should be critized for being materialistic.

If people were not materialistic then these compaies could end up shutting down and thousands of workers would be out of jobs. Same with the post office and delivery drivers, they have more work because of people shopping online for material items. So much shopping is done online and in thousands of busisnesses, people being materialistic and purchasing items they want help keep the economy and businsesses thriving. 

I understand people thinking or arguing that material items are "a waste" and have no purpose. That getting rid of material items can clean up your life and make you happy. But what is to say what makes another person happy? If that person is happy from material items then why not let them be happy? With the pandemic, people had to seclude themsleves and were very alone for 2 years. Having material items you love in your home during that time can metally help you get through things such as the pandemic.

Yes, there are people who may spend way to much on material items, but who cares. It is your money, your life and your choices. No one can say what makes you happy. If buying material items is what makes you happy, and being materialistic makes you happy, great. Society should not be critized for being materialistic. You have one life to live, why not enjoy it.
