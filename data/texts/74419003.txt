We have all heard the phrase "you can't judge a book by it's cover" but have you ever realised how often this can apply to our everyday lives? From items we walk past in a store, to people we see on tv or magazines, even in news events and politics we are given an impression on what we are wanted to believe is true based on what we perceive. Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people because of consumerism.

If you walk down an aisle at a grocery store you will see colorful packaging and carefully designed logos that are meant to lure you in to buy a product. From the company's standpoint, they need to do everything they can when presenting their product to you on a shelf to make you reach out and pick it up. Even if their product does not live up to how amazing their packaging looks, that is not what is important to them. What we see often dictates how we view a product. Would you be more likely to pick up a box of cereal that has nothing but simple text on a plain box over one that has an image of a cartoon character smiling with brightly colored background? This is not always a bad thing. If you were able to try both cereals in a blind taste test and found that the one with simple packaging was better you might continue to buy it, but if you were to walk past it in a store you might never pick it up. Companies use buyer's impressionable mindsets to get you to purchase their product.

Next time you are in a grocery store will you pay more attention to what you are more drawn to? What items are you reaching for that was not on your shopping list? Maybe you will think about what the brand's marketing and design team are trying to get you to believe about the product. It will surely be evident that images and impressions have more of an effect on you than you might have originally thought.
