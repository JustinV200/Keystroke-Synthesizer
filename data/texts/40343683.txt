There a few ways to go about completing work today, you can choose to cooperate with others or you can choose to compete with others. Some scenarios may call for you to compete with coworkers or friends but it is generally more beneficial to work alongside others than to see them as rivals. Intense competition could bring out the worst in some people and turn a team or group against each other.

One of the major benefits of working in a cooperative setting is the unique perspectives others can bring to the table. People of different cultures or upbringings can look at problems or situations in a way that can create harmony within a group. No one person has all of the correct answers or has faced all of the experiences that one can possibly face. By using each other's strengths you can cover each other's weaknesses. 

One might argue that the law of nature is to be inherently competitive as only the strongest survive. This could create a toxic culture within the workplace or group. It can lead to elements of distrust and create conflict or arguments. While it is healthy to face some competition in life, being around it constantly can lead to stress or anxiety. To properly achieve our goals, there shouldn't be a clear winner or loser, just a group dynamic striving for the greater good.

While there is no clear cut answer that one method is better than the other, there are advantages in cooperating that outweigh competing. To strive for lasting success, a group should be in harmony and free of conflict. The world is far too complex and confusing to worry about navigating it alone or in an atmosphere of discord.
