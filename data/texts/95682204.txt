          For example, we have to take two incidence. first example, a person has participate in running competition he must competitive with other person to get success.second example for second case,two foot ball team has played a match,here cooperation is a major factor to get success in foot ball team because it a eleven members game to every person must cooperate with another player to get a team success.incase if there is no cooperation in foot ball team then they can't won because to passing a ball with another player is a major role in foot ball match to point a goal.
            At conclusion,cooperation is important as well as competition behaviour.we can't say blindly which one is important factor to get success.both competition behaviour and cooperation need depends upon the work what we take and what type of game we played.
