Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Companies and people exploit the general populations suspectibility using images and impressions to sell their brand. 

Marketing is an example of how all companies use images and impressions to sway the publics opinion of their brand or their product in order to sell more. Though companies can be sued for false advertising it is very difficult (at least in the United States) to prove that a company has used false advertising to sell their products. Most citizens dont have the time or resources to spend making a case in court when this happens. In general companies that use false advertising to the extreme will be punished by not selling a lot of products. They may initally sell products based on the images and impressions they used but when people actually use the product they will not recommend or continue to buy from this companycr after they realize they were simply affected by the false or exaggerated images and impresssions presented by the company. 

Another example of when images and impressions have too much of an effect on people is when society admires a beautiful or handsome celebrity they often dismiss crimes or immoral actions by this indvidual. This could be attributed to the fact their image or the impression they have eated has influenced and outweighed the reality of their actions. 

Thus as previously stated based on how easily the public can be swayed using images and impressions that are used by a company to sell a product or public figures to sell their brand; images and impressions have a powerful effect on people.
