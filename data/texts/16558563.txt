iIthink images and impressions have too much effect on the people.people should not judge a book by its cover . because every person have different ability and tendency they look like different for different activities.

most of the people in our society look the beautiful cover of the product and judge the product benefit by the image.also people have good impression on the beautiful picture. if there are two people in the same place one wearing beautiful dress and other is not. most of the people will look at the beautiful dress up people. thus it assumes that most of the people look after beautiful.but all the time it will be not good for everywhere.in our society entartainers politicians and public figures appear is more imporatnat because most of the people follow their appearance.at present public figures are most important part of our daily life.people look their dress up and find them perfectly inspite of theire daily life. thats why most of the new company promote their brand with covreing beautiful or coloring packages and people think that it will be better product.but not every time the product will be good.sometimes clever brand promote bad thing with colorful packages. our any functional programme we alaways use beautiful coloring paper for packaging the gift.and it also gives much pleasure to the people.colorful packages are often better than their content.  when we package less important product with colorful packages it look like extraordinary. people also follow social media influencer for their beautiful appearance.for our betterment we also should juges the content with packages. 

for that i think images and impressions have too much effect on people .because people always judges other by his images and impressions.
