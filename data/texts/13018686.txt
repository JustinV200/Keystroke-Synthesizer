     Occassionally, it has been known for people to be judged by their appearance or the way they wear their hair. They have also been known to be judged by the car they drive, the clothes they wear, the shoes on their feet to the jobs they have to feed either them or their family and for this I do believe that I can say that modern society can be criticized for being materialistic.

     It seems that in todays time and era the sense of value has shifted over the years. Back in the day, things of "great value" were placed on untangible things such as morals and family were as now value only has meaning and worth over tangible things you can purchase in a store or online and the more it costs the more valuble it is (e.g. diamonds, house, car). We are so focused on obtaining the "hotest outfit" or "coolest car" moreso than we are focusing on our children's education. We priorities our lives where the things that have actual cost value to us out rank the things you can not buy and can not see (e.g. love, education, compassion).
    
      We can argue that we all want the finer things in life and would like the materialistic things that come along with it. I agree. But with those things come responsibility and you have to understand that it is not the so call "materialistic" things that we are needing in order to be happy. 
     
     We should prioritze our lives carefully with the things that matter most in life being first for us. When we do this, more than likely our list will lead with something of great monetary value and due to this fact alone is why I feel that modern society can be criticized for being materialistic.
