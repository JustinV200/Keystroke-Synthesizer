After I watch television, I realize that I am not athletic, my teeth are yellow, and I am not the proper weight, and I probably have a whole host of diseases based on the myriad of ads I have seen. Television images have too much effect on people and it has shaped our lives.
     One reason there is too much effect can be seen with teenagers. They worry that they are not pretty enough unless they wear those designer jeans. They need to look like the super thin model. Their self-esteem suffers because they feel they are not good enough.
     Another effect of television images is a wanna-be attitude. I wanna-be rich like the celebrities on television. I want to have nice cars, nice houses and nice boats. People will never be satisfied with what they have.
     Lastly, images have too much of an effect because we can't think for ourselves. We don't know what laundry detergent to buy because we have to use what we have seen on television. We don't know what cereal is the best. We don't know which pill to buy to help us battle the most popular ailment the television ads say we have.
     Some may argue that images do not have an effect on people. We are people who have our own minds and free will. We are smart enough to see through the advertising tactics and make decisions on what we truly want, not what we think others want us to do.
     However, there may be a middle ground in this argument. Yes, we are heavily influenced by television and other ads that we see on billboards and on the Internet. We are inundated. But we are becoming complacent. The images are so powerful they begin to seep in our mind, and we lose confidence in ourselves. So, we must realize the power of these images and rise above it. We must have enough confidence that we can make our own minds up. We'll still be beautiful, we will still be healthy, and we will have clean clothes with our own detergent choice no matter what the advertisers say.
