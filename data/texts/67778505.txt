I believe that self-motivation is a factor that determines whether people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition. Being self-motivated, you may not need the drive that comes from competition to be successful. Being self-motivated may be enough to drive a person even when working cooperatively. However, if I had to choose only one answer for humanity as a whole, I think cooperation is much more likely to produce significant, lasting accomplishments than competition. 

People who are overly competitive tend to focus on winning and this may put them at a disadvantage. For instance, they may be more focused on speed, rather than quality and quantity. They may sacrifice efficiency for speed. Doing something fast does not equal doing something well or efficiently. 

People who are competitive are also less likely to seek help from others. Why would they if they are competing against others, meaning that it's them versus the rest? This puts them at a disadvantage because when we depend only on ourselves, we are limited to only what we know and what we can do. Working cooperatively gives you access to additional knowledge and skills, which ultimately allows you to be more successful than you would otherwise be on your own. 

You may achieve more success by competition in the short term, especially if you are looking to be successful in an area you are skilled in or knowledgable of. However, in order to produce significant, long lasting success, you'll need to help from others to broaden your knowledge and skills. You'll need to learn from others and get assistance in areas that you just are not good at. None of us are perfect alone but together we can get close.
