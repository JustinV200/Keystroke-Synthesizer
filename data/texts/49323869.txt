Happiness is something we often think about. We often wonder what it would take to make us truly happy. Some say we can find happiness by acheiving our goals, and some say happiness comes from helping others around us or focusing on the betterment of of humanity as a whole.

I believe that helping others is where we truly find happiness. Have you have ever given a gift or donated to a cause? If so, how did you feel about it? I know that I find happiness when I see the effects of giving and helping my family, friends, or even strangers. To see someone light up when you have made their day, or even maybe their year, is an amazing feeling!

On the other hand, we have those who believe that acheiving our goals will make us happy, and it can for a short time. After a while it becomes empty, and we have to create new goals in order to keep that feeling alive. It's like revenge. Revenge can make you feel great for a moment, but it can't undo the anger you feel. It will never truly make you happy. On the other hand, if you forgive, which is a form of giving, you can let go of the anger and be a happier version of yourself for years to come.

Only knowing that you are consistantly helping and loving others can keep you more consistantly happy. Not only that, but it keeps you conscience clean. If everyone helped others, and treated each other with respect and love, we would be a much happier society.
