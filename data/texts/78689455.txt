People achieve more in life because of competition. Cooperation can be used to some limited successes, but the true achievements in life come when someone is in competition with others.

The main reason that competiton is the motivating factor for success is because it's the law of nature. There really isn't much need to go any further than this to be honest. It's the only reason that is needed to prove this point. Competition is what will motivate any living being on planet Earth to do things that are needed to be done. There is an inherit drive in all of us to compete in order to survive. We want to win. If we con't compete we lose. Competition is the driving force that pushes people to succeed. Take a look at sports for a good example of how this works. People are lined up to run a marathon. They know they are going to have to compete with everyone else. If they want to win the race they are going to have dig deep and compete like they have never done before. Sure, they can cooperate during the race by sitting behind other runners who are in front of them. Then, when the opportunity arises, they start to kick so that they can push ahead. They only cooperated as a means to compete, to take advantage of the other runner with the goal to achieve the victory. Competition is what drove them to use the other runner, then dump them when the opportunity was right.

Some will argue that cooperation is what makes people achieve things in life. That might be true to some extent, but, it is not a big enough force to really achieve anything of note. When people are comfortable, not feeling like they need to compete to survive, they get lazy. This laziness doesn't accomplish anything. Cooperation only goes so far. Competition is the true driving force that brings the best out in people.

So, in order for people to really achieve anything meaningful in life there must be competition. Without it and there is no drive, no hunger to do anything.
