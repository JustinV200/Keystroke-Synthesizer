"All that glitters is not gold."  This is a truisim in our world.  Flashy ads and targeted promotions may sell nothing more than hype to the general public.

Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.  Accurate facts and figures may be ignored when the face of a famous person tells us what to like and what we will enjoy.

For example, sports heros frequently promote products on tv.  Whether or not the particular products are well-made, quality products is not discussed.  A consumer is encouraged to purchase a product simply because a sports figure endorses a particular brand or product.

Ads for vacation destinations typically show attractive people all smiles and having fun in resort locations.  In reality the resort may have bugs, bad weather, bandits, and a wealth of body parts that we can never unsee.  The details of a vacation will determine whether or not one has a great time or a misadventure.

Famous actors frequently espouse their political views.  Often times, fans will adopt similar political views simply because they liked the actor's character in a tv show or movie, not because they agree with the particular political opinions.

Pundits will say that people are smart enough to think for themselves in the face of slick advertising and celebrity endorsements.  Are they?  The immense revenue pouring into corporations which use celebrities to advertise their products say differently.  Political PACS often find celebrities with similar leanings to promote  their causes.  The sheer number of celebrity endorsements of political positions clearly shows that Americans are unable or unwilling to think for themselves.

It is for the above reasons that one must agree that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.  As humans, we want to belong and to go along with persuasive celebrities and the majority way of thinking.  Madison Avenue knows this and uses it against us.  Details do matter.
