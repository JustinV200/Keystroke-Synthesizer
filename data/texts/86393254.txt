I think that cooperation is vital to success in business and personal endeavors. It is nearly impossible to achieve societal advancement without cooperative effort. However, I believe that competition is the backbone of human progress, and more specifically, the root of what makes my country so incredible. We must strive to get along with others and know how to work with them, but this does not mean that human relationships must be entirely mutualistic. Competition keeps people from complacency and causes them to maintain focus on improvement in order to be better than the herd. 

The phrase "iron sharpens iron" is true when it comes to advancement of the human race. When somebody witnesses another person in their area of practice or study achieving greatness, it motivates the person spectating that achievement to try to meet the threshold set by the individual who is performing at a higher level. Both cooperation and competition are necessary to success, but I believe that competition motivates the human mind more than cooperation. This is a reason why sports are so popular across the world. Our brains are wired to appreciate viewing multiple parties who have cultivated extreme skill or talent in a certain area going against each other to decide which is better at the given task. The same excitement and drive that motivates athletes to get better applies to the workforce and human progress as a whole. 

While we want to practice civility and moving forward with the same common goals and motivation, competition keeps people honest and focused. It is possible and practical to compete with same people that you are cooperating with in a certain field. The end goal needs to be progress and prosperity for all, but we as a human society cannot maximize that effort unless we push each others' limits.
