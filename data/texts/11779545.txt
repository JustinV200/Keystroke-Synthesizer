While some people promotes competition and some of the people idea was the only way to achieve success are to emphasize the power of cooperation.These are the main ideas that are mostly used to promotes competition.But some of the people should cooperate together and also had a great team effort to achieve the success.Every people should work together not only some of the people,all of the people should work together to earn the success.If they do that we willn't need to go for a success,Success will come to us.

The one should was greedy and an adamant character was not meant to be achieve success.The person should learn the ideas and skills from others too.They have to share their ideas and their skills to others,Thats the only reaons to let the other people also know about the competition and they had to achieve easilyby following these kinds of steps.

According to me,the one who accquired great knowledge by keeping the other peoples together means they will achieve the success easily.They have to learn through their mistakes and develop their skills by that way is the one ready to take risks in their life.In a complex world,cooperation, team work was the way and more likely to get their success.So if you want to produce significant results you have to put your great effort and have to think a lot and generate a new innovative ideas to achieve the competition.
