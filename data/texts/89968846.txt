      It is important for us to have a good work environment to be successful. People often discuss the importance of competition and cooperation at work. In my openion, people would achieve success by cooperation, but they also need some competition as their rewards.
      My first job was a terrible experience. I worked at a book store, and most of the employees were college students, just like I was. Our boss did not like that college students tend to make friends at work, and he was often making comments about them, such as who work well and who make mistakes. I felt that I had to work harder than anyone else not to get picked up by my boss. It was a competition. It stressful and discouraging. In fact, many people quit working in a short-term. It was true that I might learned faster, but I was not motivated enough to keep the job.
     My second job was a good experience. I worked at a pet store, and most of the people there were welcoming and kind. They cared about team work and communicated very well. I stayed motivated in this work place for long-term. Many people had been working at this place for a very long time. Some of them had that job for over ten year. However, after a long time, I was a little bored because everyday was the same for me , and I wished there were bonus that I could earn if I worked harder.
      In conclusion, I beivebe that people would have more benefit from cooperation, especially in a long-term, but they would also need some competition to stay motived. I think a company could do some bonus for their employees for their good work.
