When people focus on the happiness of others, do we find our own happiness on the way? When we think about our happiness, we do not usually think about if our individual happiness comes from pursuing our dreams or helping others reach their goals. I believe that people are more likely to be happy in they focus on their personal goals over the happiness of others. 

Every person has their own set of goals to accomplish over a lifetime. I think we find fulfillment in our lives by setting and accomplishing goals. Focusing on the happiness of others takes away from our own happiness. If I am focused on helping someone else reach their goals, I will not have time to focus on meeting my own, leading to my own unhappiness.

We all derive happiness in different ways, the way I find happiness is different from the next person, and the next is different from them. That is why its important to create our own happiness, rather than help others find theirs. Its possible that you finding your own happiness will inspire those around you to find theres. There is a ripple effect of you reaching your goals and finding fulfillment in life, which is why I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on themselves instead of the happiness of others.
