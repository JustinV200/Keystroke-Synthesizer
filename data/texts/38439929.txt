As a seasoned rock climber who will take a rain check without a moment's hesitation when given the chance to throw my limbs at a vertical craggy cliffside, the resulting happiness when I finally poke my head over the top of the rock is almost tangible. As an purely individual sport, every climbing route that I choose becomes the sole purpose of my life within the time frame that I'm allotted. 
 
While climbing routes may be a temporal goal and may fall short on a grand scale of "dreams", the instant gratification that appears amidst the bruised and bloody elbows is the most pure and unadulterated form of happiness that I have personally experienced and witnessed from others. 

Having been immersed in the euphoria that is rock climbing, I often wheedled some close friends into indoor bouldering, which almost always resulted in gaining new rock climbing aficionados. During the climbing sessions that I brought along friends, I split my time 50/50 into helping them acheive their first climbs before returning to my own heroic endeavors on the wall. In doing so, I spread the gospel of climbing but it was always secondary to my own personal acheivements. In hindsight, the emotion that I can most accurately correlate to witnessing my friends climb is camaraderie and satisfaction in our newfound mutual interest. But how could it compare to the overwhelming rush of Dopamine that engulfs my body from the core of my being to my cracked and chalky fingertips when I acheived my own climbs?

The happiness of my friends did indeed make me crack a smile, but how could I not when witnessing their own happiness. At the end of the day, they also were focused on exploring the limits of their own bodies, not bothering to check on my own ascent to greatness and rightfully so. Afterall, life can also be abridged to be an individual sport at times as well, when there is no space for teammates to give you a boost.
