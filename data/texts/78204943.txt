What is the actual key to happiness? 

People are happier when they've contributed to the happiness of those around them. Contributing to the happiness of others offers a sense of fullment like none other, and for many, it can be a main driving force in their daily lives. 

Peronal achievements also contributes to one's happiness. But that, in itself, is a single, solitary, goal. What kind of happiness can one actually achieve if everyone else around them is miserable? Just like someone can have all the money in the world, and still be miserable, one can have acheived great personal success, and still be miserable as well. Why is this? The answer is simple. We as humans strive to be connected, to feel connected, to those around us. We're social creatures by nature. When one only cares about achieving solitary goals - they lose the connectedness with those around them - which is needed to make one feel truly happy, and truly connected. When people around us are happy, and we know we're a part of that happiness, we feel connected. We feel a part of something. We feel fullfilled. And it's pretty impossible to be happy without those feelings. It can lead to a lonely and miserable exsistance. 

True happiness is compromised from many, many aspects. Personal acheivements, financial acheivments, social heirachrical acheivements - they all contribute to one's happiness. But nothing can contribute more to our happiness than contributing to the happiness of those around us. There's no amount of gratification bigger than knowing those around you are better for having you in their lives. 

In short, the actual key to our own happiness is in the happiness of others.
