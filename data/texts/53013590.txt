In the 21st century, the most important goals cannot be achieved by a single person.  Consider a recent challenge: development of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19.   Development of each vaccine required teams of scientists with expertise in viral genomes and the design of vaccine molecules.  The scientists' efforts were funded by governments across the globe.  Safety and efficacy tests required thousands of healthy individuals to volunteer to participate in the vaccine trials.  The data from those trials were analyzed by other researchers skilled in statistical analysis, and then evaluated by government regulators who were financially independent of the vaccine developers. 

Those who believe that competition is necessary for innovation might point to the fact that many pharmaceutical companies were spurred into action by COVID-19, and that there was substantial competition between companies to produce an effective vaccine, and to get it  into production first.   It is absolutely true that competition to dominate the market for this important product may have sped up the development process.  However, no company relied on a single individual to solve the multiple challenges of creating a product that could stimulate an immune response, would actually stimulate an immune response before being destroyed by the human body, compute the number of subjects required for the trials, recruit those volunteers quickly, analyze the trial data, and communicate with government regulators.  In other words, each company relied on a large team of individuals with different capabilities.   

I've selected one recent accomplishment achieved via cooperation, but a similar argument could be made for many other critical advances that have begun to change life in this century, such as development of electrically-powered vehicles and making solar and wind-powered generation of that electrical power feasible.
