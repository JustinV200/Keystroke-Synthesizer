People are more likely to be happy when they focus on their personal goals. Most of the people are not thinking about others in their life. They are working hard to reach their personal goals and they have to fight hard against others to reach their personal goals. So, they have to think about themselves only instead of thinking about happiness of others.

       They have to think about themselves and their families to live a happy life in this world. They are not ready to help others as they are busy setting up their own goals. Few people are there who are living in this world, capable of helping others. They will have time, money and all for helping others. But they don't have heart to help others. They want to be in top of the table and don't want to give any chance to others.

        These people have to change their minds and try helping others. They have to try to help others who deserves it. They should give chances to others deserving it. It will help them to live a respectful life in our society. Currently, people are focusing on their personal goals only and not on the happiness of others.
