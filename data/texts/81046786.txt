In today's age, materialism can be seen in a negative light by those who disapprove of it. For others, it's glorified and perceived as a normal way of living. From media to social networks, materialism can be seen all around us. Celebrities are often idolized by fans for their abundance of material things - the latest technology, luxury vehicles, trendy apparel, and dream homes. Influencers on social media often depict a life of affluence that their viewers can only dream of living. However, despite it's bad reputation, materialism should not be criticized.  

I operate on the philosophy to each his own. If one prefers tangible possessions and has the monetary means to do so, it is their choice. Our society tends to be judgemental and assume that everyone should operate under the same umbrella. Owning material possessions doesn't make a person bad.  I don't agree with placing labels on people for the way they live their life. Yes, celebrities are notorious for flaunting their material worth on television and fans aspire to be like them. Many people do not have the financial means to afford material wealth as celebrities do. Just because someone has the financial means to afford luxury items doesn't mean society should point fingers to criticize them. Most of the time, it's those who lack the financial capacity to afford material things who shun others for having the means to do so. I believe in letting people live their lives the way they want to without having to feel guilty for having material things. 

I operate on the philosophy to each his own. If someone wants to possess an immense amount of tangible things and they have the finanacial means to do so, they should be able to do just that without being criticized. People should not be criticized based on their ability to afford material possessions.
