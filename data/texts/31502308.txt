In modern day society we all love to express the way that we feel through gift giving and hoarding things that people give us. While gift giving isn't much of an issue, hoarding is. Hoarding can make people materialistic along with gift giving. People shouldn't be talked down upon for being materialistic. Some ways that people remember loved ones is by being materialistic. Without those things we wouldn't be able to remember the ones we loved. Not everyone is able to have access to cameras and computers in order to keep their loved ones close. Others may have access to all that but would much rather have a physical thing to remember them. 

People that are hoarding should also not be criticized. The only thing that they should be criticized for, if anything, is if they're hoarding and know that it's affecting their physical and mental health. Most people do not know that they're damaging their health by hoarding. Those that do know, quite simply do not care; they only care about their "things." All in all, I do not think that we should criticize anyone for being materialistic because it could be the only way that they can have things from loved ones. It could also be the fact that they just don't know any better and don't think that it's a problem. 

Materialistic things could also be someone's only way at feeling gratification. Some people just feel happy being surrounded by things that they bought or things that they were gifted. There is nothing wrong with keeping things that people give you, but there is an extent to where it just becomes too much. Some people go as far as to keep receipts from places that they don't have any need for. It seems that most people just want to keep the memory alive of places they went, what they did, what they ate, etc. Sometimes that's just really not necessary. It's especially not necessary if you don't have any need for the things you kept unless they're pictures.
