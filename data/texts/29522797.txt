When Madonna premiered the video for "Material Girl" in the Eighties, it was one of many defining moments that highlighted that era of decedance. Lyrics of a lavish lifestyle while being paraded around by men in tuxedos dangling pearl necklaces in her face - it was everything a girl could ever want right? Even though that was the eighties, it could have been told in any decade before - and after. Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic? We have only to look at our past and present to answer that.
In the Eighties, tv culture like MTV played videos all the time showing rock stars like Motley Crew in fancy cars and being surrounded by beautiful women. Shows like Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous would describe how millionares lived, with thier mansions and expensive furniture. The audience kept thier eyes glued to the television screens, consuming all that was broadcasted to them. Then people went to the malls, and bought products that they perhaps seen in these shows or music videos. Today the method of delivery may be different but its still the same. We have smartphones now that have apps like Instagram. Instagram now has people called "Influencers" who promote products to the masses. Its a relationship they made with companies to get people to buy more and more things. 
Some might say its not the peoples fault that they are materialistic. Its something that is sort of like having a gerbil inside a wheel in its cage. We are trapped in this cycle that we can't escape. Perhaps because we are inherently always after the things we find attractive. Or maybe due to some of us in society who have figured out how to use our emotions against us by placing desirable things in devices like entertainment. Ultimately, we are responsible for our own actions. The criticisim is justified. For materialism is entirely a human desire.
