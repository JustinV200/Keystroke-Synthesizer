 Happiness is a feeling we all experience during our lives. In my view, people will be happier if they focus on the happiness of others rather than pursuing selfish personal goals. I also believe that, people will be very happy if they set others` happiness as their own personal goal. Setting your personal goal as making others happy can lead to a very satisfied life. I will explain this in the following two paragraphs.
 The first reason comes from my own experience and the experience of others around me. I tend to feel more satisfied with my life when I help my family, friends, or colleagues at work rather than only focusing on my own personal tasks. I think as human beings, it is in our DNA and as social beings, we all are coded to feel satisfied when we help others. Seeing someone smiling, relieved, and relaxed makes me more happier compared to seeing them struggling in life. I do not see the world as a zero-sum game. In my view, the world has enough resources for everyone and life is more fun and enjoyable when we all help each other.
 Secondly, even if the individuals think that happiness comes from focusing on their own personal goals, they should spend time focusing on happiness of others as well. Because, when you help people to accomplish their dreams and be happy, they tend to not forget but instead help you to accomplish your own happiness. You will never know when you will need help to reach to a happy stage in your life. Because of that, I think we all should focus on helping others to be happy. 
  Consequently, I think focusing on others` happiness is the best way to reach to happiness. Because, people tend to remember the good things that we have done for them and they will return the favor when we need their help. And, we are social beings which we all designed to feel happy when we see others surging in life. So, I believe people will more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others rather than focusing on their personal goals.
