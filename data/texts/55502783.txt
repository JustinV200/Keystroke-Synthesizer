Happiness is something that everyone strives for in their life.  No one wants to be unhappy right?  So how do we find the maxium happiness in our lives?  Do we seek out happiness by pursuing our own goals and dreams?  Or do we maximize happiness when we focus on the goals of others?  Let us examine.  

I personally believe the best way to maximize happiness in you life is to incorporate a little bit of both theories.  I feel that by following your dreams in combination with seeking to serve in helping others to be happy, you can obtain the maxium level of happiness in your life. Consider it a form of the best of both worlds. 

One can argue both sides of coin with the thought process of either one of these paths.  If someone chooses to pursue a life of happines via the follow your own dreams route, one can argue that it is selfish to consider only oneself's interests.  Doing so could lead to feelings of guilt and emptiness which would leads to less happiness. 

Conversely, one could argue pursuing the path to happiness by setting a goal to make others happy could lead to feelings of unfufillment.  How can I make others happy if I am not happy with myself?

Therefore I believe the path to true happiness is by pursuing both routes, making it a priority to make sure you pursue your own dreams while ensuring you help other's dreams come true as well.
