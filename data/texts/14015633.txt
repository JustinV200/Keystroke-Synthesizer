                  There are two types of people in the world most of then are they will happy in there own achivement and the goal of there own.and the another is they will help other and see other happyness as mine accourding to my ifsome in happy with there own achivement and goal they will always in some small groups they will not estblaished.
                  buy the way when people focus on others happiness by helping others like those who are not able to buy a food are any thing they want  in  that stage some one help them in humanity basis and see the others happy in there faces and he also find happyness along the way.for example mother teresa she always see happiness from the others faces only by doing what ever she too in the basis of humanity and helping to others aiming their oum happiness.
                   when you drems your oun personal goal means you and your family will get all happiness not others.so its like nothing you achived. So if you helping others not only you and your family happy your people who are souranding also happy so in my view of happiness of others is pruly happiness  thankyou
