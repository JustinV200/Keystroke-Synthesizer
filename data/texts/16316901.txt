  Life is like a video game, you must take care of your health and decide if you want to level up. There will be ample opportunity to acquire treasure and a responsibility to create and offer something to this extraordinanry world. Some may say this is a materialistic and capitalist world, but I choose to view it as a wonderful avenue for one to be the player in one's game of life. A sea of opportunity to level up.

  All around the world, clever and creative beings pull out of them some marvels of offerings. These treasures, inventions, artwork, teachings- can be freely given or traded for a currency. Being that energy is a form of currency, and that energy was invested to bring it to fruition; it is perfectly acceptable to have money as the currency that is traded for one's creative energy and time. One must know their value for their time and energy, and not let one's self get burnt out. Throughout history we have seen what happens to the martyr. Though admirable to be selflessly giving, if we do not replenish our self then we cannot continue to contribute to the same caliber. 

  Should society be under a lens, scrutinized for valuing and enjoying materialistic things? Though money may be the motivation and driving force for some to do what they are doing, I am grateful for the amazing contributions that are brought to life because of it. I like to think that passion is the moving current beneath the surface, and that money is a by product of what is created out of being aligned with one's passion and purpose. 
 
  In conclusion, it comes down to perspective. One has to change their state of mind and match it with action. Be the main player in your video game of life and level up! See materialism as the tool it can be, something to compliment and assist in life. It's not all there is to life. Never should be a substitute or distraction from tending to one's inner world.
