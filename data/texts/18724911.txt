I'd like to start with the observation that all forms of society all benifit from materialism. All from the lowly college kid to the successful business man. Materialism is what drives us to do better. Everyone is trying to make the most money to afford the best things in life. And to criticize otherwise is just plan foolish. Here are a couple points I'd like to address.

If you're agruing against it and you have your iPhone in your pocket, it seems you are materialistic. Why have an iPhone if a flip phone would do the same? It's because you're materialistic in some way. Any one who has gotten anything name brand, materialistic. Why strive to get the nice car? Materialism. It is in all of us and it's not a bad thing. Now when you start being toxic or evil, that is when your materialism becomes an issue. Its more of the character of the person and how they acquire said materials. But that can be with anyone, not just materialistic people.

So in conclusion, we shouldn't criticize modern society on being materialistic. It's a driving force in our economy. It creates jobs, or even keeps the job market stable. We should look into people and companies that are doing dirty tactics to acquire that wealth for materialism. Make sure it is all fair for everyone to be materialistic. That is the issue in modern society we should be criticizing. I hope I, atleast, made you think in a different view. We have to look at it from all angles, not just one. Thank you.
