There are many cultures and many philosophical views on the pursuit of happiness. some people show altruism and enjoy helping others, some people enjoy individualism and want to puruse self betterment. 

I beleive happiness is found in a mixture of both. To be clear though you need to acknowledge your own strengths and characteristics and pursue your own individual growth. Aristotle beleived peoples goals were individualistic in nature and beleived in the personal growth of every person. I am in agreement with him. First we need to take care of ourselves, then we can take care of our personal loved ones (family) after that we can give back to the community. If we do not excel or find out what we are good at then we will not be a big contribution to society. 

Mindlessly wandering without a goal in thought is not a great path to find happiness. That is like being lost in the woods with no idea of where to go. Plato beleived that everyone had to contribute to society. Aristotle believed everyone had to focus on themselves. Plato even acknowledged that there was no good way to structure a society based on fairness because of peoples personal desires. 

I do beleive having a goal allows you to focus. Hence you feel happier because you are focused and not thinking about being happy. Either way you are pursuing something relevant to you. Helping others can be a very rewarding feeling but ultimately, it was again something you decided to do. Everything is shaped through your eyes.
