I believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people, espeically the younger generations. 

Body image and eating disorder issues can happen to younger adults due to them believe that what they see is the desired "norm of society" when in fact there is a lot of air brushing that goes into what you see on a ad or magazine. This unrealistic impression of our "norm of society" give the impression to many that they are not good enough or pretty enough nor perfect enough is they do not have the "look" that is so airbrushed for the world to see. This is unacceptable and heartbreaking to subject the world too and it's damaging to many young adults worldwide as eating disorder and many other self esteem related mental illness are on the rise. 

I believe photoshop needs to be disbanned and true beauty and flaws embraced worldwide! It's important to me, as an eating disorder and BDD sufferer, that people learn to understand the impact that images and impressions have on many people today and will have on people in the future! This is why I believe that images and impressions have too much effect on people today.
