In my case the only competition that I have is with myslef, by this way you avoid to compare with another person, everybody is different and coming to this world with diffrents skills and missions. Competition brings only indivual objetives, that's means the selfish behavior is always present, the ambition eat the real love for passion of your purpose. However if the competition implies cooperation between one team for hit a goal, everything change; the energy for helping each other create an environment of love force and gratitude.

Competition alone against others, create a harmful environment because the energy is dark and even if you achive the goal, the indicidual will stil feel empty, because this energy from your ego will never satify with real happiness. But if the competition is with yourself for be better human being without punished yourself, this process will be a continuous motivitation. 

When the competition mixing with cooperation in effective way, the creation of a new social, physical and cognitive skills appear in human life. Nevertheless everything will depend of the people culture and also family is a big factor of influence, for finish this idea, nowadays the world is very complicate and at the end of the human life, the most important impact is going to be how many people did you help to be succeeful and the legacy that you create with your own success.
