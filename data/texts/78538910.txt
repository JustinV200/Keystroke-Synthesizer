Materialism is an issue that most of us humans have to navigate in our lives, and we all have to decide how important it is to ourselves perersonally and also socially in many number and types of groups. Each and every individual will usually have this delema to deal with unless they are handycaped in ways that others have to take care of them and they have no control of their life necessities.
If we where all socialialy and sustainably conserned about our lives then materialism would be a group effort and we would pursue a group effort to maintain a hamagenous society. Most societies attempt to pursue a fair and even handed aproch to materialism with laws, religion, norms and so on.
However puting limits on material gains is not a black and white issue in most cultures and yet it should be. Capitalist are the least conserned and comunists and socialists attempt to solve the issue by a governmet down approch. 
When it comes down to materialism in the end, in this day and age how much one participates is mostly up the individual. Materialism is something very imprtant that our socities should be condoning but they are not. Materialism has been left to the individual to decide what is moraly right or wrong. In the end materialism like greed will be what makes or breaks the success of human social evolution. It has the potential to destroy the ecosystems that sustain our very lives.
