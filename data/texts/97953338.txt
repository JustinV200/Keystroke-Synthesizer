Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic? This is a question that a lot of people ask these days. In my opinion there are a few aspects of it to take into consideration. What is materialism anyway? Is equiring material property like estate or cars the same as buying too many clothes? 

I think this is such a broad issue, that it needs different approach. When it comes to our day-to-day lifes, we are flooded with cheap items that are not lasting a long time. Instead of buying two good pairs of pants, we purchase five or six just in case they break or the color washes off. Another thing that encourages more spending and buying more items is price manipulation. We see sales on every corner and purchases are encouraged to spend money. There is a flase feeling of the sales ending soon, so consumers spend and equire items now and collect them. When you think of being materialistic it's more of a question are we bing trapped into thinking we need more and more items. There are better models of cars available every year. Computers and phones are faster and take better pictures every few months. We are forced to keep up-to-date and if we don't have the newes models of phones and cars, we feel like we are excluded from our circle of friends. We fill the pressure to buy more and more. Our houses are getting too small for all the items we equire during our lifetime so we rent storage places to store the excess of the materialistic purchases.  Materialism is a great source of grieve and can contribute to felling low and unhappy. The feeling of getting new things lasts only a short while and once it's gone, we are stuck with the unnecessary item and the regret of spending the money. 

As a final word, I think our society should be critisized for being materialistic. The way we're speniding our money not only hurts our well-being, but is also bad for the environment and out planet.
