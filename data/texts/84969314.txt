Is winning everything or is striving together the path for progress? That is the question that many wrestle with as they seek to determine if competition of cooperation are better ways to achieve success. While competition does stoke the fires of imagination and innovation, ultimately it is through cooperation that we realize the benefits of those efforts.

Since our earliest days we see the result of unchecked competition. You may be familiar with the story of Cain and Abel. These two brothers both wanted to offer sacrifices to God. Abel focused on his own offering while Cain, intent on competing with his brother, was dejected and bitter when God found favor only with Abel's offering. That bitterness ultimately led Cain to murder his brother and resulted in his exile. 

It would be unreasonable to suggest that this story is the end result of competition but it is illustrative. If we focus only on outdoing others instead of being satisfied with our own efforts, it can have negative impacts personally and socially. Proponents will say that regulated competition is a driver for growth because it pushes people beyond the boundaries or strictures of daily life. There is truth to that assertion though the unintended consequences are rarely considered. 

It is with consequences in mind, intended or not, that I conclude the worthiness of cooperation. Progress may not be as quick via cooperative means but it is guided by a sense of responsibility. Competition often overlooks impacts to people, resources and environments and therefore should be considered a lesser measure of success than cooperation.
