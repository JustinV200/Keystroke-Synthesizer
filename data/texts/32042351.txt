Cooperation can lead to great results. The biggest reason it can lead to great results is the fact that ideas can be drawn from a multitude of individuals. Whereas, a single person might become stymied in their progress to come up with a solution to a problem. A single person might also come up with an idea that isn't good at all. But because they are not working with a group, that bad idea might not be recognized. So it is beneficial to cooperate with others so that deficiencies in a plan are caught in advance of them being implemented.
Competition can be good in some instances but it actually can be counterproductive in other situations. Sometimes synergy is better than having people work against each other, especially within an organization. As stated before, it is best that people come together to come up with solutions to problems at work. More people working on a problem can help ensure that an adequate solution has been implemented.
Lastly, it is important for there to be cooperation within an organization because that helps ensure that  everyone will be fully engaged in doing the task at hand. Having everyone cooperate ensures that everyone is happy with a course of action and helps mitigate any hesitation from those who might want to pursue a different course of action. Because if everyone is in agreement than there should be no issues. So yes, cooperation is definitely a good thing.
