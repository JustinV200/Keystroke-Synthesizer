Topic : Cooperation Vs Competition.

Introduction:
               In this essay we will see about the success rate of cooperation and the competition. Which one is the best way to success in their life.

                Some people think that competition will make them to achive success in their life to reach their goals. For each and every thing they will compare with others and want to become front of them. Sometimes it will work and most of the time it won't work. The competition will always make us restless and mental pressure.
                Comparing with the competition cooperation will defenetly success for most of the peoples. In most of the place we all see it people if they cooperate with each other they will sucess in their life and also the success of the team. So all of their team members will sucess while they cooperate each other.
               For example if take a foot ball game all of the 11 players should cooperate with each other and understand each one, than only they will success in that game. If any one player have a competition with another they will surely loose the game. Competition will always push us in to the deep pressure and maximum time we will loose our success rate.

Conclusion:
            So finally I think that comapring with competition, Cooperation is the most powerful and people will achive their sucess in their life. If two or more people cooperate each other and work together they will achive their goal and their sucess rate will increase. But in competition it won't work like coperation, two people will always think to break the other to success in their life.
