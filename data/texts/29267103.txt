I believe competition to be at the heart of success. I think cooperation is a necessary component of competion at times and that it falls under the umbrella of being a good competitor. I think competing against others for various goals is an undeniable and long-standing part of the human condition.

Competition comes in many forms. We do not just compete against others--we frequently compete against ourselves in our striving to accomplish goals and to get rewards. We compete against and try to rise above the obstacles in our way, whether they be outside our control or whether it means rising above our own adequecies to meet a challenge.

In challenging myself, I am first competing against myself. Competing against the voice in one's head that says something can't be done or that something is impossible. In competing against others for something, I am pushed to do my best and to think harder and do more. In this way I find competition to be healthy and empowering. It's not that someone has to win or lose, it's that I am pushed to do my best. While we can't function as a society without cooperation, being willing to cooperate and compromise ultimately helps us achieve our own goals and makes us better competitors.
