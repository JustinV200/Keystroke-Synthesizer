The old saying, it takes a village, can be used in any scenario.  In the workplace, cooperation is what can make any organization more successful. Competition can create cracks within your team and prevent the organizations achievements from being met.  Even if competition encourages some to try harder, it does not work as well as cooperation and teamwork.
As individuals, we all have various strengths that can benfit ourselves, as well as those around us.  The abilities and talents we hold as individuals can be great assests to our collegues and our management team.  Bringing together a group and recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of the team will make a more efficient and productive work environment.
Cooperation also creates a more sustainable workplace.  If all hands are on deck, doing what they do best, the team can achieve the daily tasks without added stress.  Competitiveness can create an environment where the team is so busy besting each other in certain tasks, that other tasks are ignored or forgotten.
Competiton can also be very self serving for the individuals that enjoy being competitive or are driven to succeed through being the best and winning.  However, cooperation benefits the entire group, since all the strengths of the team are being combined to complete the task at hand or acheive an ultimate goal.
As the old saying goes, it takes a village, can be adapted to any group or team.  Together more will be successfully accomplished, while competing with one another has minimal benefits for the group and untimately are individual goals that only benefit those who have won.
