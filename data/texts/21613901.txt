When you look at your favorite celeb or a politican are you looking at them or are you looking at the impression that they leave on you. We go day by day not really looking at normal people who work 9-5 jobs, who don't go out every weekend and pop bottles or driving around in fancy cars and boasting their image because of the lasting impression that it would have society and themselves as a whole.

As for those who do live in this light, they actually understand what it's like to have something held agaisnt you or have your image tarnished due to a misunderstand or some sort of problem that may have caused someones wardrobe to malfunction.One celeb that comes to mind when it comes to image and impressions is Lady Gaga. She has cultivated her way through her image and what impressions she left on the world when she first started to where she is now. From just Dance to A Star Is Born. Gaga  has canged the way she saw herself and the way we wanted to see her. 

For some this may not be the case, some celebs have had thier struggles coming back from whatever issue they had going on such as britney spears and charlie sheen; and for some they might not be able to bring themselves back from the imoression they have left on the world but that's all because of how society is and how some refuse to let go of what they did to put themself where they are. I only mentions names because of celebs and not what they have done because most of should know these names by now what impressionn they left on the world and how it effected thier image.
