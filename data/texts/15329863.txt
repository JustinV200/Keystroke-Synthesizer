There may be many therories on how to achive happinees. You surely won�t ever get the vast majority of people to agree. But do you really want to listen to the advce of those that haven't found true happiness?

Find personal meaning. Find a goal for yourself. It needs to be something you can focus on, set meaningful objectives, a timeline and rewards for yourself along the way. You must find something within yourself to find true and meaniningful happiness. Focusing on things outside your goal may be pleasant or even feel rewarding, but in the long-term, they will not lead you to happpiness. 

Your happiness is a result of what you do. Not what others do for you, or what you do for others. That doesn't mean be selfish, self consumed or narcissistic. It simply means that you are in control of your own happiness. Haven't you always felt the most pride and happiness when you've achived someting on your own?

some may say that happiness lies in focusing on others, ensuring their happiness and success. Bringing happiness to others can be rewarding and meaningful, but it doesn't result in your happiness. Making the world a better place, helping others, and helping others find happiness is an admirable goal. However, don't assume that someone elses' happiness is your path to happiness. 

No doubt some will disagree with this position. I would argue thet they are likely still searching for their own happiness. Very likely they are searching in the wrong places. Only when you find your true happiness will you see that I was right.
