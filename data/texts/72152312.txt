One thing that most Americans can find themselves familiar with is materialism. At times, it can feel as though this country prioritizes material things, and people are constantly trying to keep up. Even our parents and generations before them spoke of "keeping up with the Jones's". There are many views on how this importance on materialism affects our society, but I am here to tell you why it is vital that we collectively move away from materialism and towards idealism.

We have seen that the more people place their value and importance on material items and status, the farther they get from human connection. Putting value in material things takes away from our ability to see each other as equals. Many would agree that when we die, we don't take anything with us and that our relationships remain the most important part of our legacy. It is far more important to focus on our relationships and ideals than on the things we own. Some may say that value equates to status but I would disagree. People may always try to portray themselves as higher status, of having luxurious things, but what others really want is human connection. At the end of the day, we are all more alike than we are different. So many of these material things are merely social constructs that keep us feeilng different from one another. Science shows that humans really value each other and the connections we get through vulnerability and hospitality, charity, etc. more than we value the posessions one another has. 

At the end of the day, it is far more important to value people, places and ideals over things in this life. Start talking to those around you, I bet they would agree. The less stuff we have, the happier we are, and that has been repeatedly proven across generations. We should continue to criticize our society for being materialistic. I know it is certainly a lesson I will instill in my children. I hope you will consider to do the same, too.
