In a world of images, appearances and social media, it is obvious that these factors have a immense effect on people in our society. The rise of social media in our society is something that has caused our perception of images and people's outwards appearances to shift. 

Social media and "influencers" use of photoshop and other editing tools to come off a certain way on their profiles is an epidemic. The insecurities is causes teens and children that have access to it is very dangerous. Studies have proven that children and adoloscents that have access to social media and see posts like that are subjexted to having low self-esteem. 

We also notice this in the political campaigns as well. Throughout the whole camaping trail and process it seems to be more about how well a candidate can articulate their points and present them to an audience instead of how qualified they are actually are to be elected into the position. They seem to be appealing to the audience and gauge community reaction instead of trying to implement real change or feasible policies. 

Overall, based on the points I brought up I believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.
