happiness is a feeling that differs from people to people. People's feelings, habit etc plays a role on what will make them happy and what will not. For a person who can't see for him being able to see would make that person happy beyond the world, whereas we take seeing for a thing we do naturally. The same applies for other mediums.

We humans arefirm believer in progress, we want to see how well we are doing today comparing to a week or month ago, and again another human nature is helping others in their time of need. Remember how a blind people be happy by just being able to see? the same can be applied here, for a person who requires progress in their life they tend to find their happiness by pursuing their personal goal. For those who do not require or want to progress anymore or don't want to be happy by only just doing that they tend to help others.

But there always are variables, people can help others from the goodwill of their heart and thus be happy. While people trying to get out of their poor economic state by focusing on their career and by being happy with it. In the end it comes down to personal preferences, peoples nature and state have a huge role on deciding this. So to conclude i want to say that people will likely to be happy in whatever they have a passion for and what really makes them happy.
