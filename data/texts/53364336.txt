     Competition versus cooperation.  The comparison is a competition in itself.  While some believe cooperation drives success more so than competition, one must look at the measure of success being determined.  On a personal level, competition drives success and as a by-product, success of the overall group or entity is increased as well.  While cooperation drives the overall success of the group or entity and not the personal success of individuals as they are melded together as a group and may not be recognized for their individual successes. 

     Competition naturally drives those participating and seeking to win to be successful.  Competitors put forth their greatest effort to win.  Thereby, the success of the individuals as well as the organization are typically pushed further than done by cooperation. One may argue that without cooperation, the efforts of highly motivated competitors may not be as successful.  However, the innate drive to be the best can even be found in cooperative environments where all individuals strive to stand out among the pack.  It is the competitive drive that creates success at all.

     In conclusion, while cooperation does offer some motivation for success, it is competition which makes people strive to be the best even within a cooperative environment.  Success is measured by  becoming the best or winning at something, the very nature of success is competitive.  There simply is no such thing as success without competition.
