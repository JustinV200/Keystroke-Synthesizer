It is an intewrsting concept to think about: Do people achieve more success, or perform better in coopertation or competition. I personally feel like this could bt dependant on the situation, but in most siations I find myself leaning toward competetion. In the next few paragrahps, I will outline scenerios and why cmpetition tends to be the greatest form of incouragment. 

While cooperations at the surface seems to be the better choice out of the two, I find that this, most times, leads to people not putting in their entire effort. They generally feel they can slack off a bit, due to one or more people shouldering the burden. They know if they begin to fall back, there is still someone therre to pick up the slack. When you are int comptetion, it is up to you and only you to prove that you can work effectively and break new goals. 

Competiveness is a large driviactor in industries such as sales, where your success depends on your own personal drive and using the tools given to you effectively. In most cases, those who preservere in competitions will be rewarded hansdomely. This is a huge reason people push m=themselves in competetion. The recaongtition and rewad are an effective way to drive a pseron. This clearly shows competition in the better light, show casing how effective it is to drive success.
