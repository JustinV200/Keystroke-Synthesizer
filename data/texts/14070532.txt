Happiness is created by our mindful and always depend on our gaol is very important. One day my friend and me walk on a road and saw a beggger. The begger was an old man he did not have proper clothes and good things and foods. So my friend help the begger and so she give the food and ask the old man why you beg the food for others. The oldman say that i have not an begger, One day i hungry so i did not have money so i did not control my hungry so i beg for that time, on that onwards i begg for food to others.  
My friend is very sad to say that to me this news, she decide to give daily food to old man, the old man was very happy to take the food from my friend. My goal is only not an happiness, other happiness is also our happiness she decide. Our goal is not only succed for our life. I have consider other happiness is also our happiness.
On that day onward happy other on any way, So focus on our goal is very important and also other happiness is very important.
