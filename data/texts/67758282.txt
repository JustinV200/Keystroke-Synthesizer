Modern society should not be criticized for being too materialistic, if the people that compose this society are not unhappy that way. The wonderful thing about modern society is that people don't have to be materialistic if they don't want to be, and would prefer to avoid material pursuits. Materialism helps us have a physical reminder of how we are doing in comparison to those around us and it provides many of us with motivation to do better. 

Some say that this habit we have, collectively, of judging our success relative to the number of things that others own is destructive or detrimental, but it is really no different than measuring our happiness against the happiness of others, or the free time of others. 

The reality of the situation is that at some point, we, as a society decided that the material things that we own signify our successes and that is not bad, as long as people don't overextend themselves to show successes they haven't really achieved. 

What does need to be addressed is not that we are too materialistic, but that we are far too judgmental of those who do not wish to show their success through material goods or that have not achieved that level of success that allows them to have the extremely flashy material goods. We need to meet each other and support each other where we are. 

To summarize, material pursuits are not necessarily bad, but the way that we, as a group, judge those who don't wish to pursue material things or are not successful yet, should absolutely be criticized. We don't necessarily need to change society or reinvent the wheel, but we do need to change the way that individual people treat individual people, and we should criticize each other when we treat others poorly for any reason, but most certainly when that criticism is based on their material standing.
