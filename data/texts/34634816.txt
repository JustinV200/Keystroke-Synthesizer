People achieve success more when they are competing with others rather than cooperating because it's a dog eat world and when we complete a task our main objectives are to win and be better than others.  If a person wishes to climb the ladder to the top he must leave others at the bottom, he must never allow others to follow him to the top or that ladder collapses and others reap all the rewards and benefits that you should have.  If I am climbing a ladder the objective is to reach the top, not let others climb on top of me hypothetically speaking.  I cannot reach the top of that ladder cooperating thus I will never believe that cooperating with others will help me achieve success.  To further my point the only people who have ever succeeded in life and gotten all the breaks are those who work independently rather than work with others.  Ladder climbers like Donald Trump and Paris Hilton did not cooperate with others to gain wealth, they acted in ways which could benefit themselves and push them to the top.  Even something as little as recording yourself sleeping with somebody works to your own benefit and pushes you to the top.  I would rather be a winner than cooperate with others.  Competing with others is invigorating and gives you a sense of accomplishment if you do not win.  There is no better feeling in the world than winning.  I just want it all and don't want to let anyone get in the way of that. I love the feeling of completing a project knowing that I did it and nobody else helped me.  It makes me feel like I am better than others and could do anything I set my mind to, cooperating with others is a huge waste of time and I will only end up disappointed in the end.  It is tedious doing what others want me to do and I want to do what's best for me, not what others want me to do.  It is always better to finish in first place rather than last.
