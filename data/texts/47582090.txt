It is my opinion that consumers are often being mislead and being awed and distracted by a pretty label, or an vibrant series of colors, or an unspoken but yet so strongly implied false outcome. I would be willling to bet that if  the time and money spent creating, formulating and testing these productsn were shown in comparsion to the time and money spent on a campaigns, flashy prompts, actors who pretend to be consumers...The amount more spent there would be astronomical in comparison.

    We are shown beautiful  flawless models on skincare product advertising. Young women will often get it in their head that if they buy this product, if they use this product relihgiously, that their end product will be that image of perfection that they see in that ad. It's sad this is how products are represented...by an attractive face that I'm willing to bet has never came into contact with said product. Ad companies, show us a real result, show us the girl next store that has fell in love with the product, show us the busy mom, with the signs of aging on her face, being able to look in the mirror and smile...hint of cconfidence in her eye. Tell me please how that would't make a first class product ad or commerical? 

  I know there will be people contradict me and everyone has their right to that. I am just proving my point here, showing how frustrating it can be for a woman not unlike myself. Brands, get it together, don't market us junk with false exxpectatios. You guys could do so much better with business if you werent c0nsumed with the same flashy misconceptions your force into our heads.
