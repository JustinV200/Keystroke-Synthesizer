Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Buying things we dont need has been going on for decades. Its been shown on tv and advertisements to people everyday. Everyday people see cars, clothes, and electronics that make them look cool. Not to mention it may be time for an upgrade for a new car, or phone. N0t everybody lives the same life, or has the same money. One mans trash is another mans treasure.
  
  Sure it can be argued that one does not need certain items. But we'd have to look at each individuals case to determine that conclusion.  Why did John buy a new phone when he had one that works. Maybe the phone is starting to show its age. Maybe it doesnt charge as good as it once did. Why does Mary need a new car. Hers seems fine and it gets her from point A to point B. But it doesnt have air conditioning. The seatbelts broke. The brakes are starting to go out. Are these people materialistic for buying something they already have. I would argue no.

 Buying those items also help the economy. Someone had to make the item. Someone has to deliver it. If someone invents a great item, then they should sell it to as many people as possible. We live in a capitalist country. Buying and consuming things is in our nature. As long as there are commercials and advertisements, people will continue to buy.

 In conclusion the idea of materialistic isnt the problem. As long as the person isnt a hoarder. You might have grown up poor and always wanted an item you couldnt afford. Now that you have gotten older and started working , you can now afford it.  If you want to stop people from being materialistic , teach them at an early age the value of the dollar. I believe buisness and finance should be required to learn in high school. That way people will manage their money better. But no, theres nothing wrong with buying things you want. Its your money. Do what you want. People get jealous over other people having things they want.
