   What is more important when trying to succeed? Competition or cooperation? 
If you ask me then the answer would be cooperation and here is why I think that to be true.
Some people think that competition is the key to achieving more success in life and everyday tasks but I think cooperation is definitely more of an important factor in succeeding.

   Cooperation is important because without it you aren't putting in your best effort and also not learn anything!
Let's say you are on a competitive dance team, your team is learning a new dance and everyone is being coached on what to do, if you didn't cooperate and listen to what your coach is trying to teach you then you will not be able to learn the dance properly and will be off from what everyone else is doing and frankly would most likely make a fool of yourself.
I personally have a daughter that was on a competitive dance team for four years, my daughter cooperated and listened to what her coach was saying and doing and she eneded up being front and center in dance competitions and won many times, while other girls whom did not pay attention or cooperate were not in the front and looked ridiculous when the whole team danced together, you could definitely spot which girls were cooperating and which ones weren't.

   Some might say that competition is more important thank cooperation because when you are competing and really want to win, you will try harder and do your best, while this is most likely true, I think that cooperation makes more of a difference because no matter how hard you try you won't be able to succeed in your task if you didn't cooperate and don't know what you are doing.
In conclusion, cooperation is far more important than competition when you are trying to succeed and will bring you much farther in life, next time you are trying to decide if you should cooperate or just wing it, definitely cooperate because cooperation is the key to success.
