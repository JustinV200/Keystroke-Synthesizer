cooperating with your fellow man creates lasting achievement on both sides. competing with eachother will cause rifts and cause people to take advantage of others while trying to get ahead. cooperation builds up everyone involved where as competition encourages people to use others as stepping stools to boost themselves up. working together creates lasting results that help people come together instead of divide them

when communities cooperate to work towards a common goal it is much more likely to produce more significant lasting goals whereas working competively while still achieving goals can divide communities instead of tying them together as a single group working to achieve something together. 

competition creates rifts by pinning the people against eachother. people are willing to step on others if it will give them an edge competititvely. when working competitively people are likely to use shady tactics resulting in harming their fellow members of the community in order to use them to benefit themselves.

all together where competition has its benefits. the cons related to compition out weigh the benefits. Working together cooperatively benefits everyone involved. i see no downside in everyone working together cooperatively. I believe the world would be a much better place if we all worked together instead of against eachother. cooperation is much better for society than competition is.
