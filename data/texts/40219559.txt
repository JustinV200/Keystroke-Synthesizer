Hello, All the items her look very shiny . All of these are polished and cleaned during delivery from the manufacturer. Coming from manufacturers outside the market and shopping malls. Everyone in the shop decorates them all in a way that makes them look shiny and beautiful to our eyes. I buy it as soon as I see it .Sometimes we go shopping without even looking at the expiration date. People need to be very vigilant. 

     Usually the producers have no idea what is going on in place. There will be no comments about it in advertisements and newspapers. Inform the product site how they are cleaning. But no company here is showing it. Only a few companies show up his product manufacturing.

         Politicians and models wants to give prominence to these rather than show it in the media and this is behing supported by the media. This is the biggest social disorder. They also put it to the donors not revealing how the material is media. It would be great if all of this changed. Often it is better to act with the same determination as what we see in our eyes. If what we think is true then we must take it as the most important thing.
