                     ;life's best things are not things,;they say .this straightforward but profound statement merits more  discussion. we all live in a materialistic culture where most individuals are more focused on their possessions than who they are.today too much important is placed on your clothing brand,your vehicle,and your overall possessions,some people believe that those who live in luxury have a happier life than they do when they observe them .this is the idea that society instills in our minds,which causes many of us to spend our lives pursuing wealth rather than happiness .the primary fault in our culture is avarice.
  
                       because our society depands on people continuing to spend money.we are constantly being urged to buy more of that.i believe that if everyone took a moment to consider what they truly needed in life ,the cycle would end .
  
                    10.964  in actually ,wealth inequality is more extreme than people realize ,despite society's desire for people to labor to increase their wealth ,many people are attempting to attain a status that is actually unattainable.im not suggesting its terrible to have good stuff,but it might be wise to reconsider if its your top priority.our culture gives more weight to how much things can be replaced ,but people cannot.the best things in life are not something i will share with you .your choice!
