In today's society people tend to valuable the beautiful, shiny things over things that seem dull or unexciting. People tend to read books by their covers without taking the time to truly see what is inside. This ranges from merchandise in stores, TV ads, politicians and partners in life. People today don't value what is inside as much as what is on the outside. 
If you ask someone why they picked a political candidate, partner in life or the item they bought from a store, their initial response would be because it was attractive to them. So often people get caught in how things or people appear on the outside, they never take the time to truly see a persons true self or the inner contents of a product. America as a whole worhships the beautiful, glamorous parts of life. People think they should do the same in order to fit in and this leads to so many wonderful things and people being overlooked. They would rather go for the highly attractive partner whose beauty only runs skin deep instead of taking the time to get to know the average person who has depth in mind and soul. They would rather buy the expensive name brand clothing item that is fragile and will not hold up to the test of time rather than the inexpensive item that won't gain them any recognition but will last them so much longer. It is an issue of appearances in our society now where we only want the pretty, not the mundane things that are a better fit for us in the long run. 
Society as whole here needs to be revamped. There are no emphasis placed on things that are actually good for us but only on the expensive, shiny things. We as a society need to do better. We need to dive deeper into all things, do more research on products, learn more about politicians actual stances on platforms and give that "average" looking person a shot. People may just find that diamond in the rough they are looking for and would have a much more fulfilled life.
