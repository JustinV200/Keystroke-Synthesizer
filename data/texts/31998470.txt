
When a person asks themselves the familiar question "am I happy or will this make me happy" it will usually result in a common no. Many of the things poeple do every day isn't for thier own happiness but of the happiness of others. When we go to our job most of the time poeple don't enjoy the work but the work they perform makes the employer happy so that they in turn will pay the worker to make them happy.

This happy sharing economy is how the world functions. The only way for a peroson to reach true happiness is to focus on thier personal goals. All other focus may bring indirect happiness but that is nothing compared to completing thier focus as a person. Sometimes these focus involves suffering early on reducing current happiness. This is often nessassary. 

Let us take education for an example. Doing class work often does not lead to happiness but if your primary focus is to complete a degree then when the degree is achieved then a more pure happiness can be reached. I choose to seek out my happiness through my goals but I respect the choices of others that foucus on getting happiness from others. I would argue though that the primary "others" that you get happiness from are also included in a primary goal such as raising children or getting married. 

If a married person says that they get happiness by making thier spouse happy then infact they are pursuing a personal focus for happiness.
