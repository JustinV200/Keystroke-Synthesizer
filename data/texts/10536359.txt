Society has deemed materials possessions as a way to establish high social status or money. There are some citiens in society that feel that material possessions are more important then experiences. Having alot of possessions also can help fill the emptyness in peoples lives. Some people take great satisfaction in acquiring possessions. 

It can bring happiness to someone that is suffering from depression. There are some that just take pleasure in spending money. They find it soothing to their mental health. I do not think that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. I think people should be allowed to do whatever they would like. I do not think people should be judges or scrutinezed for wanting to do something they find enjoyable. 

For some people this gives them a great satisfaction and meaning in life. What good is life if all you do is work all day and come home. People need an in-between. They need to be able to do enjoyable things outside of earning money. It could be things like taking trips, or making egtravagent purchases. No one should judge another persons choices as long as it is not resulting in negative consequences. People should be able to live their lives as they wish. Personally I am not much of a materialistic person however I do believe in having a good time and enjoying life. There are some things that I buy from time to time that I take pleasure in. Lets face it, spending your hard earned money on things you like is a very easy task. Who dosen't enjoy purchasing some cool things with the money you earned. It is nice to save some money but also important to treat yourself from time to time as well.
