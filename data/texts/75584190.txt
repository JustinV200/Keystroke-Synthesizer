I'm quite certain that if you are reading this, you have been asked the question "If you could one take 3 things with you to a deserted island, what would they be?" I'm sure you also would have spent at least a few moments sifting through all of your most prized and/or useful possessions attempting to identify which ones would "make the cut." I will admit my answer to the question has changed many times. However, each time I list physical materials. I list things that I am certain I would never be able to make or construct myself. I have also included things I have worked dilligently for. No matter my answer, they are all material things.

We all need material things to survive, but when to step back and look at our society it becomes immediately clear that we are obsessed with material things. There are many people who have actually killed others to gain pocessions. It's sobering to think that many people only exsist to accumulate materials and belongings. In my opinion, as long as there are people who steal, hurt, and even murder for material gain, we should be critized for being materialistic. 

In contrast, it can be argued that there are just as many instances where people have given up possessions and materials to help someone else in need. Additionally, those who hold the puppet strings of our society can possibly be blamed for the materialism that consumes modern society. 

In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that modern society is materialistic because there are numerous incidents of theft, injury, and death related to the obtaining of materialistic goods.
