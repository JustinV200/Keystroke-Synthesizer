A supermodel on the cover of a magazine.  A bright and busy design on the can of a craft beer.  A perfectly brushed image of your best friend as a result of a camera filter.  Things are not always and usually aren't as they seem.  The super model on the cover of that magazine has possibly spent years of barely eating and have her body taped to make sure everything is in the right place.  The bright and busy beer doesn't taste any better than the plain jane can.  And we know our BFF is just the girl next door.  Pretty, yes.  But not perfect as the filter would have her appear.

We see what we want to see, and to see otherwise we have to think outside the box, which many people are too busy, or too lazy to do.  Marketing professionals know this, and build their campaigns to make a product, person, or idea seem flawless.  If there is a negative, it may be listed in small print with an astrisk.  Or maybe let's not address it all.  Too often a purchase is made without full disclosure and full details of the actual product.  The fabric of that gorgeous dress wasn't as luxurious as the picture appeared.  The yogurt isn't nearly as creamy as the advertisement alluded to.  Disappointment prevails if we believe everything we see and hear.

Of course, no one is going to use an amateur photographer to photograph the items for sale.  Because we want the best opportunity to market our products.  However, if the consumer is fooled, how will those reviews after the sale look?

In conclusion, honesty is always the best policy. Put your information out there and let an opinion be formed.  Let's help people become smart consumers and opinion creators instead of creating a facade that many won't realize until it is too late.
