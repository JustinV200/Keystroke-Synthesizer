Some promote competition, and some promote cooperation. Which will produce the most favorable results?

People generally achieve their maximum level of success when they incorporate both cooperation AND competition. How much of each should be used? The perfect mix of cooperation and competition is probably not feasible to implement often times, or even knowable in some cases.  That being said, cooperation is the ultimate driver most of the time in successful human accomplishments.

If we were to look at ALL professions and institutions, cooperation generally leads to the most success. Even when we acknowledge the individual accomplishments spurred by formal or informal competition between people, the cooperation that created the framework for the competitive situation itself is still evident. The phrase "Two heads are better than one" applies in many pursuits. Especially potent is a team of individuals who pursue things from differing mindsets, with differing toolsets. There will be a certain synergy that results from such a partnership. Synergy, as you may know, is getting a result that is greater than the sum of the constituent parts. Who wouldn't want that for an outcome?!

We must acknowledge that a healthy competitive spirit should never be completely ignored. Even during cooperation, small, friendly, yet competitive rivalries can increase the productivity of the participants dramatically. This is just incorporating a bit of the competitive approach, not promoting an all-out "every person for themselves" attitude. Many team-building exercises actually include quite a bit of competition to foster more cooperation.

Overall, therefore, society will best be served by individuals cooperating more so than by competing.
