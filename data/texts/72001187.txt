In our society -- in 2022 -- many of us live our lives seeking to outdo or out-perform the next person -- every next person we meet almost. The old adage about keeping up with the Jones' is more real today than it was so many decades ago when the phrase was coined. That sort of mindset has manifested itself into a society that is so much more materialistic now than it has ever been before.

It boggles the mind what people will spend money on. And, many times, the things that are purchased get used once -- sometimes they sit in a closet or on a shelf or in a drawer and never get used.

Meanwhile, other people -- in our same society -- have no money and no means to acquire just he necessities of daily life. Some people live on the streets while other people live in homes that have more rooms than they can realistically use, and more possessions than they can ever realistically use either.

Sure, it may feel great to have a lot of things, live in big homes, drive nice cars, wear nice clothes, etc., etc., but all those things are just temporary and ultimately unimportant in the wider scheme of things really.

Our society would be so much better off if we all took a step back and recognized the reality of that situation. It goes on all around us -- every day. All we have to do is open our eyes and look.

What we should be doing instead is take a moment to reflect, and perhaps move toward becoming a society that is less materialistic and more humanistic.

If just one or two (maybe three or four) out of every 10 of us spent more time looking out for our fellow human beings (and the planet for that matter), our society (and the world) would be much better off.

Granted, it might take a few decades, perhaps a generation or two, but if we don't decide to take a step back and even start considering the reality of our situation, never mind making plans to help things get better, we're going to be find ourselves in a world of hurt in the not-too-distant future.
