I do belive that images and impressions greatly effect people. The whole saying " Image is everything", comes to mind. Advertisements are all about image. If the image is there or isn't attractive to the human eye then consumers will not be inrtrigued or interest in what is being advertised. Just like the saying of, "First impression is everything". The first time you meet someone is the most memorable moment, the first time you see an advertisement of a certain good, the first smell of a fragrance or the first time you visit a certain place will always stay in one's mind. This is why it is highly important to get advertisement correct so that it will appeal to the the consumers one is trying to market a product to. Sometimes images are manipulated to look effective as if it is a great product and will do wonders for people or make ones life and the way the look, feel or function ingredible it may be false. But if it looks and sounds good enough then it will effect people in a positive way and they will buy that item from the advertisement even though the may possibly be disappointed in the end. So yes, advertisements and images have way too much effect on people. Images in magazine and on social media have filters and gives a false sense of reality. It makes young people belive that certain people look like this in real life and then they go through extreme efforts to look like the image they have seen. It is unhealthy.  There needs to be something done about this to prevent mental health issues in young impressionable people. Maybe there should be warnings on social media platforms under images to state whether a image has been altered, so that people will know and not have a false since of beliefs. I know there are some advertisements that state whether an image has been altered for advertisement purposes.
