   Is competition necessary? In this individualistic world where you should do anything to get ahead, can being nice actually mean one succeeds? This essay will attempt to argue that cooperation, rather than competition, ultimately means achieving more success rather than less and that the adage, "Nice guys finish last" is wrong. 

    While it's true that competition can be useful, that is it encourages us to be at our peak preformance, I feel that cooperation makes everyone better off. In competition there is one clear loser, in cooperation, even when one loses, it can often feel like a victory because of the teamwork and comradey that was used. Here, you can liken competition to being all about the destination while cooperation is about the journey. The journey teaches you that even if you fail, you will be okay, especially with the help of others. As long as you have one person on your side, you will be able to overcome obstacles you never even thought possible. 

  In the end cooperation will get you better results because you are utilizing the talents of everyone around you and they may have a skill that you don't have and vice versa. With cooperation, you aren't facing your problems alone but with an ally or allies and as often the case, the more the merrier. People are more likely to gather towards the person who is cooperative because they are seen as a helpful, warm person rather than a competitive person who is seen as in it only for themself. The nicer you are, the more friends you will have that will want to return the favor and help you out.  As humans we rely on each other and that's why cooperation rather than competition will yield more success in life.
