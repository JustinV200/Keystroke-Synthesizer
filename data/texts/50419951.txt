Success can be attained in a variety of ways. Some methods involve rivalry or collaboration. The majorety of the time both approaches are required for success. One though makes it easier to succeed than to other. Competition is the best path to success.

Your effort to succeed  is increased by competition. People put in more effrt to succed more then those around with them, which increase their motivation and make them to improve. People always endeavour to please themselves in order to outclass others in competition. People do work hard and are successful as a result. Individuals also  aim to better themselves when they compete with one another in order to succeed more and defeat their rivals. This way, they not only gain success but also develop into better people overtime. People would not be working as hard if cooperation and competition were more engaging. Although co-operation may aid someone's success, that person must work hard to achieve success on their own. 

If a friend is working with that person to achieve success, the person being assisted may begin to place more importance on the buddy than the real goal. Co-operation can be beneficial and satisfying, but in the absence of rivalry, it makes people to lose sight of their aims, in this case success, which they were hoping to achieve. While collaboration doesn't bring out the greatest in a person's attribues since other people are assisting that person in becoming successful so that one person doesn't have to work as hard, competition brings out the best in people. More than co-operation and collaboration, competition promotes success.
