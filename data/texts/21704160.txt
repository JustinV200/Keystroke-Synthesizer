Perception is reality.  How we perceive things to be is our actual reality.  Is it fact, maybe not, but fact according to who?  What is their reality?  Images and impressions have a huge effect on people. But too much? Maybe so.  Otherwise, why would we run out to buy the new fangled gizmo that promises to make all our lives easier. When you walk out your door in the morning and see a beautiful sunny day aren't you much happier than when you walk out into a dark gloomy gray day?  Perception?

We are all looking to be stimulated by something. That's where the advertising and PR guys draw us in.  We are gullible and easy to manipulate.  Sad is the person that doesn't get excited about anything. We are constantly fooled by everything around us.  But that is our reality, that is our perception.  That's what makes us different.  That's what makes us unique.  If we all saw the world through the same lens it would be a dull place to live. Perception?  

Perception is a big part of customer service also.  If the customer perceives you to be disgruntled and only there for the paycheck, then they will perceive their service as crappy.  The difference in how you offer a customer 10% off is determined by their perception, hence reality.  "Fine, I'll give you 10% off" or "Today, I'll make you an unheard of offer, 10% off."  Which is the better deal?  Perception.  Perception is reality.  Are you going to buy that coffee pot that just brews the coffee or are you going to buy the one with all the bells and whistles you can't live without but will never use?  Perception or reality? It is easy to be manipulated into what we think we must have or need.
