     Everyone wants to succeed and everyone believes they can reach success. However, some people thrive in groups while others thrive on their own. The question is success available more to those who cooperate or those who are comepetive. I believe cooperation limits the level of success while competition breaks those limits.

     Cooperation is a good way to begin a path to success. Working with other people that are striving themselves for personal success gives a major boost in the start phase.  Cooperation is a moral move on behalf of humanity but the leaders of this world know they must use greed and selfishness to stay at the top. I believe once someone is comfortable they will be able to drop the boosters of group think cooperation and sail higher on their own merit and focus. I believe it is the people who thrive on competition are those who reach the very top.

     Does that imply that if you only cooperate with others you will be limited on your success? Yes, I believe that group think only gets you so far. The individual must be able to go within themselves and find a fire that often puts them in conflict with their group. To succeed you must be willing to make moral sacrifices. I believe that to get to the top of any organization you have to be cut throat and vicious. In conclusion I argue that competition is the path to the most success.
