Material excess is something we all should be aware of. I feel this has been getting worse over the years as there is more opportunity to buy item we don't really need. With the online shopping that is available in this modern era it only take a click of a button and your can order a just about anything you need. These online shops like Amazon, Ebay, Target and Walmart and many others make it easy to buy and get within a day or several days.  Using prime on Amazon even earlier than most your delivery will arrive at your door. It could also arrive in your post office bos. 

Most people don't need a lot that they buy. They may have something like it or could do without but, it is so easy to buy quickly.  I feel when you think you need to make a purchase you should wait a while. It is a good idea to think about your purchases and give it some time. 

I have found when I do wait on making my purchases, sometimes I am happy I did not buy it and could live without or already had something like it to use.
