I believe that people achieve more succes by competition than by cooperation. Competition brings out the best in people because they have to strive to do their very best if they want to do better than someone else in any area of life, whether it be in business, sports, or academic pursuits. 

Sure, many people believe that cooperation is more important because it requires people to work together, but cooperation in and of itself does not bring out as much success in people as competition does. I know this to be true because many people can lazily depend on other more hard-working people to pick up their slack when cooperating while working together on tasks. I saw this happen while working on group projects in college. One or two people would often do the majority of the work while several other people would do very little work and still get a high grade even though the work they did do was not very high quality and the better students had to often redo it. 

Yes, cooperation is an important skill for people to acquire, but competition drives them to stretch themselves even moree than cooperation does since they can only depend on themselves to succeed when they're involved in a competition. If someone they're competing against is doing better than them, then they have to try to figure out why that is and make a renewed effort to outcompete the other person. I have found this to be true in my own life time and time again in business, sports, school, and even in social situations at times.
