       In the debate between whether people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition I believe that cooperation breeds more success.  In my personal experiences whether it be at home or at work I think that working together leads to better outcomes than competition.  When working on projects at work I will often seek out others' opinions and help so that I can maximize that project's success.  I find that several set of eyes are better than one in gaining perspective and wisdom.  Collaborating on a work project makes other people feel their thoughts are being heard and that they hold value.  If I am working on a project at home, for example a landscape project for the house, I am going to get more done in less time through cooperation rather than competition.
        I realize that many will say that competition is the ultimate driver for personal success and this may be the case for the top echelon of society, certain business or in athletics.  For the vast majority of people though I believe that cooperation is more reliable for individual successes.
        In conclusion, through my personal experiences, I feel that cooperation will lead to more success for most people in life than will competition. I think this is a healthy debate to have and welcome differing viewpoints.  Thank you for your time.
