Often times images and impressions can have too much of  an affect on people, purticulalry because it creates an unrealistic or unachiveable  standard.  These impressions are mostly used to sell products by pulling at peoples internal ideal for the perfect body and perfect life. Things that can simply not be filled by consumer products.

Women are succumb to health and beauty products because of  inflated impressions seen in magazines and telivision. Many times, not only do these products not produce the results but also create physical and mental health issues for the people who consume them.

Men are led to believe the new big red truck will not only get them them the women but also betray themselves to other men as strong and hard working. This is simply betrayed every new truck commercial that has ever been seen.

While imgaes and impressions can be good. They are too often used in advetrtising to exploit consumers into purchasing their products.  They can create an ideal that is far beyond and over the reality of most people. Not only do these impressions and images seperate a person from who they really are, it seperates them from there money.  To chase an ever changing ideal that will never really be completly met.
