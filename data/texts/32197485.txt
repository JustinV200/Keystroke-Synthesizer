Modern society has become so obsessed with materialsm, that it has caused irreperable damage to our society.  We live in a world where children have access to social media - platforms that mostly use people to promote - products. These are platforms where materialism is the epicenter.  And most of our world, is on these platforms. Every celebrity has a platform on social media, and every celebrity is promoting "materialism".  Never before have door to door salesman been so popular.  Not only should our society be criticized for their obsession with materialism, but they should also be educated about the consequences, enlightened, and supported in their decisions remove themselves from her tallons.  

We no longer live in a culture, at least here in America, where we are just "spending money as a vital source of meaning and happiness".  No, in this generation, we are mostly obsessed with lifestyle, and followers.  Our society encourages the notion that you must have more followers, and you must promote, and show off your "lavish lifestyle".  Traveling, eating in luxury, trend-setting, partying, music making.  Spending life savings on "experiences" that will not accrue into savings, a nest egg, a retirement home.

Our society is being corrupted by this obsession with materialism.  Our society is beginning (in many parts of the world) to have very little regard, compassion, or general humanity for their fellow man.  Our youth has seen their mothers and fathers struggle in real life, but on social media - where materialism brews - they "see" young people making the choice to partake in materialism, and they are being corrupted by an illusion.  They are being brainwashed by the illusion that they too can live this life of luxury and are willing to find it at any cost.
