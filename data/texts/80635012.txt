Why cant it be both? Believe it or not NO one human being on Earth has the same  experiences. It should only be that one persons' choice of happiness for them. People have different outlooks on life of what happiness is.


The improvement of someone's life should and will always bring happiness to anyone who excepts it. Some people believe that happiness is only steemed from success or having a family when others don't even work towards those goals.


If there lives were looked upon by different people from another background or upbringing. It would completly change people hearts and perspetives about how people are not more alike than they believe.


Its very concerning that people feel judged by there different ways to be happy. Instead people should embrace others differences and maybe the world would be a better place.


I believe that life itself is happiness as long a you do what you love!
