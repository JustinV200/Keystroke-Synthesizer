Everyone in the world want to achive some thing in their life, the way to achive depends upon their own. But many people now a days competating with others and achiving their success. More the competiton many of us now making cooperation with others and trying to get success in their life. Any how both of them trying to to get success in their life.

Everywere we cannnot win only by competition we have to cooperate with others and be team to achive something. A single tree can't make a forest. Meanwhile competiton will give some power to us and tells us to complete the work quicker. Having competition with others will help us to grow us in high position, but the competition must be in healthy manner not by illegal activity.

For example, if we are playing basketball match we are competiting with other team at the time we have to fight with other team not with in us. Just by competition alone we can't win the game we need coperation with in the team players. If we don't have the cooperation with the team we can't win the game. In my point of view more than competition many get succeed by the cooperation its give more success to the people.
