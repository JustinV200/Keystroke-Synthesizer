Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. It is working towards a goal and earning money to buy those material possessions that keeps society going. We get up and go to work every day to acquire our material possessions and that is what society strives towards.       

It is true that society has let material possessions determine our worth and that those who do not have such lavish possessions are not valued as high in society but without such items we do not feel worthy. A big house, a nice car and fancy clothes makes a person higher in society than someone who drives a clunker, rents a one bedroom apartment and maybe doesn't dress in designer clothing. Society has determined that the more possessions a person owns makes them a more valued individual. 
In that respect, we should criticize society for being too materialistic. Material possesions really do have nothing to do with the type of person an individual is, but unfortunately society does judge a book by its cover before ever getting to know what is underneath. 

We should not criticize modern society however because living in a capitalist nation and aquiring material possessions is was keeps our economy going. It is what keeps us employed, it is what puts food on the table and keeps a roof over our heads. Without these materialistic possessions, we would not be able to afford the necessities we need to support our families.
