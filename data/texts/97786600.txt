We all know what it means to be greedy. Should the concept of materialism be considered greed? Or is materialism something that is needed in modern day society? How can we find the balance between greed an materialism? We should decided whether it is a necessity or should be criticized at greedy.

I believe it is a fine balancing act. You should guage whether you need to buy excessive things or is it something you just want. Certain things can't make you happy for very long and end up weighing you down. Decide if temporary happiness is worth long term debt or other ill effects. Happiness does not rely in things necessarily but in experiences.

For example if you spend a lot of money on an expensive car to make you happy but you have to work extra hours and sacrifice your free leisure time wouldn't that be considered a burden? Now imagine you spend money on a more frugal car and you're able to have more free time to have more fun. I would consider that to be worth the hit to my ego and make me an overall happier person. You can apply that analogy to almost anything you purchase. Society needs to look at themselves deeply to realize what counts as ego and what you would consider necessity. Some of the most fun things in life cannot be bought. More people should be aware of this.

To summarize society should be critized for being materialistic if they try to acquire more than they need. You rarely find truely happy rich people. Some of the happiest people in the world are lower class. Question yourself as to whether you're buying something for your ego or for something that will directly help your level of happiness. If you choose to be greedy you should be critized as such. If your intentions are pure critizism is unnecessary.
