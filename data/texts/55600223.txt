Happiness is a state of mind that one can reach in numerous ways. My personal belief that true happiness can best be achieved by devoting one's time and effort to focusing on the happiness of others and on the improvement of humanity.

If one devotes time and energy to supporting one's family, the reward is true happiness. In addition, if one devotes time and energy to helping one's community, the reward is also true happiness. Often a family is dependent on the support that it receives, be it time or work or money. Selflessly making the effort to provide for those needs of one's family comes back in the form of happiness, a reward that does not even require a thank you. The same holds true for working selflessly in one's community, be it voting or picking up litter or volunteering. Delivering food to home bound seniors with the Meals On Wheels program fills the volunteer with happiness just knowing that the elderly are being checked up on for their own safety and not just for delivering a meal.

One could argue that these efforts are selfish attempts to bolster one's ego, believing these efforts are just a way for the giver to look in the mirror and justify giving as a way to avoid guilt should one not provide the aid. That might be a personal goal, but that argument is beside the point. For whatever the personal reason, giving of oneself is likely to deliver the most real happiness.
