Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. People spend their hard-earned money to aquire possessions that make them happy and improve their quality of living. While many people say that money can't buy happiness, I disagree. Having excess money means that it can be spent however they would like to spend it.

Happiness can come from many different sources. One of those is spending money. Some people may actully like the act of spending money, but most enjoy the possessions and experiences that come with it. If someone's passion is to play guitar, spending money on guitars, amps, pedals, etc. should not be viewed as materialistic. Spending one's money on something they truely enjoy can improve their quality of life, thereby improving the lives of those around them. 

Many say that all you need to be happy is the people who love you. While that is a big part of life, sometimes the ability to buy what you want makes it easier. A family might not need a new house with a big yard, but that yard may allow kids to run around and have fun.

In conclusion, spending money on items that make you happy should not be criticized. Buying possessions and spending money can help one live their life the way they want to. There is nothing wrong with spending money to enhance the experience of living.
