The materialism it states that, person always think to make possessions and gain lots and lots of money. They always wants to save money and asstes for their future values, it will definitely destroys them in anyway at some point of life. they do not even realize about but they were happy because of being an materialistic persons. Their one and only iomportant thing and to earn materials and possess it for their own purposes. they did not even consider about the others. They gives more importance for obataining assets and materials. They belives that materials are having the high level of value but they do not consider about humans.

I thought that the materialism was totaly wrong, it can make many consequences in one's behaviours. They do not know how to survive in the world without maiking lots of money and making asstes for future. They considers that the future will only move on to the next step of life with carrying these materials and money. They always wants an sophisticated life and always need latest products.
 
They were always competitive about owing things, concidering their goodness it was not an right thing for a person. We should follow some moral values and sprirutual beliefs. We should help each other persons in the world. the world was actually connected with everyone and everything with in the world. So we should make a step to make each others happy and helps to live their own lives happily. And the important thing we should not claim anyone's amterials , asstes, money or properties, we must follow the moral values.
