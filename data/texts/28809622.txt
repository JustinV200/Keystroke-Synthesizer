I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals more than the happiness of others. Sometimes, people spend more time focused on the feelings of other people who do not care as much about them. These people are usually unaware of the fact that the relationship is one sided. 

I think people that are the happiest are able to focus on their personal goals as well as the happiness of others. It is better for these people to put themselves first, then the happiness of others. I think it is hard to be happy around others if you are not happy yourself. Without personal growth and achieving things people feel unfulfilled in life. Without personal fulfilment, there is no way to enjoy life and feel like your life is worth living.

Personal goals give people a reason to get up everyday. Being concerned about the happiness of others causes people to worry about whether or not their actions are affecting people's personality. It comes across as desperate to the people they are trying to control. Happiness is a hard thing to force upon people, so I think it is best to focus on yourself and not even try.
