      I am very interested in computer field. I chose the computer science course in my college course with the goal of achieving something in the computer field. I am still working hard with the goal of achieving in the computer field today. But I still have not achived my goal. Even though it hurts in my mind I am working with the unshakable hope that one day I will achieve my goal.
      Although helping others can bring us happiness, there is no limit to the joy we can get when we reach our goal. This is called selfishness but humanity grows there when every human being achieves it. When the individual achieves his goal the happiness he achieves grows with the humanity and concern to help others.
      So success is guaranteed if every man works with the intention of achieving his goal. There is also the humanity of helping others when one achieves own's goal. His mind is satisfied when he helps others like that. I could not feel happy because I had not yet achieved my goal in my life. I have always had the worry  that even if I get satisfaction from helping others, I will not achieve my goal. So my opinion is people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals.
