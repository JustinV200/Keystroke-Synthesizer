Images and impressions clearly do have an effect on people, as for decades, the media and companies have been honing their ability to ensure products (both human and material) are shown in the best of light. However, the question of it having 'too much of an effect' is an interesting one. It can be interperted in several ways. Too much of an effect from an ethical standpoint? Or is the question based on the actual possibilities?

I will address the ethical standpoint first--when using another's mind to influence them for your own profit, that fits under the standard definition of manipulation. Anyone taking part in tricking someone else so that you--or your company--gains influence, is morally and ethically wrong. The basis of most western ethics comes from religion, for better or worse, and no mainstream religion supports such tactics.

The second portion of the question is based on the premise of it even being possible to have too much of an effect. I would say it certainly is, as many studies have shown. So does it have too much of an effect in that standpoint? The human mind can tricked in many different ways, so, no, it isn't 'too much' from that point of view.

In the end, I will have to assume the question is regarding the ethical question rather than if it is possible to have 'too much of an effect'. With that in mind, it is very easy to say that, yes, images and impression have too great of a influence on people. From buying things they do not need to supporting things they, perhaps, shouldn't. The tragic thing is, I can not see this as ever changing; there is far too much money in the stated tactics, and are used by politics and businesses alike. All one can really do in the end is try and protect themself from the onslaught of promotions as much as possible. If that is even possible at all.
