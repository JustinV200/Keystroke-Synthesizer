Everywhere we look, either on the TV or our phone screens, on the busses, on the billboards or hearing it on the radio or while listening to a podcast there is a virtual world that is meant to persuade us to choose a certain product, vote for a certain politician or listen to a certain genre of music.
 All of these are becomming more and more persistent around us and honestly pretty much no one cannot evade it and the purpose is to have as many as possible people engaged in the whole mechanism that is called free market.
The entire economy is now based on a large scale consumerism that has been turned into a culture. Look at holidays nowadays, they cannot pass without huge spendings on every household. It wasn't like that just a few decades ago.
 There are however countries that are still trying to preserve what was good and pure in society despite the pushing marketing from investors. It was all done with education and preservation of certain traditional customs reminding people of simple life.
Unfortunatelly the marketing is getting more clever every time moving at a faster pace and with the projected images will eventually capture every person's desire to become someone that he/she is not.
We have to keep in mind that the images we are seeing are just projections trying to give everyone of us a false image of something they say we should be. It is  in our will to remain who we are and make wise decisions on our own.
