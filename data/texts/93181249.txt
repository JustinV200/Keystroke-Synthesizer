    I believe people are in general, happier focusing on personal goals. Focusing your attention strictly on the happiness of others will in many cases leave a person dissappointed and let down.  I believe that people are at their best when trying to achieve their own happiness. That might include a better job, furthering one's education, upgrading yor standard of living via better housing, automobiles, clothes, etc., and really setting achievable goals for yourself.

     Those who focus their attention on making others happy can and do, usually get into trouble with this type of thinking, particularly if the people who's love and affection they desire take advantage of a situation in which they obviously benefit greatly from having a person that so desires their approval, that they place their own well being behind that of another person. This can lead to pretty miserable existance if your efforts at someone else's happiness aren't rewarded with mutual love and gratitude which often will not be the case.

      I believe that focusing on your own happiness is the much better road to go down. Having goals and achieving them is much more gratifying. The results of the hard work and effort one makes reflects directly on your own life and situation. Trying to please other people will often lead you to make choices that might be more beneficial to others. I don't believe any person can be happier by focusing on the wants and needs of others. Everyone should put their own success and happiness front and center. I think in most cases, this results in a stronger, more focused and assured individual who doesn't necessarily need the approval of others to feel happy and fulfilled.
