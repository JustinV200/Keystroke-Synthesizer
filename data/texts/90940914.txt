We are surrounded by visual, audio and written stimulation that might affect a person's view of how the world should look and sound. Surrounded by perfection, bright colors and pleasant images might make a person feel inferior and hopeless. Is this a healthy outlook? It can't be.

Social media and advertisements present a glimpse into the utopia of beauty, intelligence, talent and wealth. For the average person it presents a reality that  not really achievable. Young and impressionable people perceive this to be their ultimate goal and seek to become like these images. Trying to attain the unattainable has a negative effect on their psyche. Suicide rates among teenagers and young adults is at an all-time high. During the pandemic people took to the internet to pass the time and to keep social connections. Bombarded with photos that are deeply filtered and advertisements sent by Artificial Intelligence targeted to the user's preference, it's unlikely that many were able to avoid being exposed to augmented reality. Bots and AI social profiles are accepted as "real" and became "normal".

Some would say that this is a normal precursor to a world where Virtual Reality dominates our lives. The movie "Avatar" is a good example of exposure to bright colors and lush environments caused moviegoers to experience a depression upon exiting the movie theatre. 

So how do we combat this? Look around at your current environment often as you peruse social media and advertising content via your devices. Stay grounded and in the present. It's possible to enjoy a glimpse of "utopia" without leaving the real world. Appreciate the colors of nature because that is the real deal!
