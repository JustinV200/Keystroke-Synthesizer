Media presentations often negatively impact people's perceptions of reality.  The deceptive presentations of visual and auditory images and impressions can distort the the truth and lead people down a rabbit hole.  

Nowhere is the impact of this crazy train more noticed than in today's political environment.  One only needs to read the headlines to see how the media twists the truth to promote a false realty.   The biggest offenders are the extreme right propoganda machines--like FOX and One America News.   They have single handedly promoted bizarre conspiracy theories about election fraud and disguised the racist GOP agenda through medal manipulation.  Worse yet, they have elevated Donald Trump as a false demigod.  

The news media are not fully to blame.   Tech media platforms give a base for promoting falsehoods.  The biggest, Facebook, youtube and twitter, account for source of most of the decptive presentations.   Their unregulated platforms give a soapbox for any crazy person to promote false hoods.  Too many people are ready to believe these falshoods and results in millions of people living in a fantacy world.  Reality doesn't exist for these believers of falshoods.  

We must find a way to bring our politics back into the the realm of reality or we may find ourselves in a dire situation.   Hitler's false promises brought about WWII.  Let's not create a new Hitler and restrict media truthful presentations.
