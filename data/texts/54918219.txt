Modern society should not be criticized for being too materialisitic. In a high tech, easy information era, our desires, aspirations and achievements/purchases are overamplified to project a false reality. In essence, we are perhaps no more materialistc that our forebears.

If we use post-WW2 America as an example of an earlier era, perhaps the top "materialistic" desires were a new house in the suburbs, 1-2 cars, a couple of children, nice clothing and at least a working class income.  For most Americans, especially those who were not subject to discrimination, these "materialistic" goals were rather handily achieved. One of the discerning differences between then and now is that communication then was rather limited - TV, radio, teletype - instead of social media. Thus, even if there was an overwhelmingly amount of materialism, the bandwith for dissemination of this appetite was limited at best and may present an illusion.

Contrast communication methods then and now and it is easy to imagine how perceptins of materialisim become inflated in a high tech era. Socail media, instanteous reporting, etc. make everything werem much more graphic than the reality.

No materialism is not nore than it was. Nothing has changed between then and now. It just weems so much worse.
