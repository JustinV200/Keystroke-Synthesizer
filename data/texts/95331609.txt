In my point of view that happiness comes from by helping others who can need that. Because if we had a wealth or a minds to help someone means, ofcourse you had to do that. Because its been a good behavior and also its such a great addiction. Not everyone in our world need our help, only some of the people who didn't get their needs properly may need our help.

So some of the people may believe that the happiness comes by persuing their dreams and also by keep following their own personal goals only. But some of the people believe that the happiness can get keep doing some goals than their own happiness. In our world we have only few of the people that don't do their lives living for them. They are run for their lives for  them and also for some people who they need help, they have a great humanity. Its been  not done by all of the people, it was only done some of the people.

According to me, the happiness comes by the people who can see the happiness on others, if we do that means we had  develop a great humanity by organizing the group of people.If some one see that the other people helping others means, they also starts to think about helping others.So the conclusion was Aiming at something other than their own happiness, they surely find happiness along the way. Not by only focus on their own goals only.
