People will be more happy if they focus on their personal goals than focusing on happiness of others.Everybody will have their own happiness on different kind of ways. In this busy world, most of  the people have time only for thinking about themselves, for setting goals and work to reach their goals. They don't have time to think about others and their happiness. 


The only people they will think other than them will be their family members. They will set a goal, focus on the goal to achieve success in it and get happiness from it. If they get happiness from it, they will be ready to do anything to fulfill needs of their loved ones and will make them happier by doing that. This will be the only moment they will be happy by the happiness of others.


Only a few people are there to get happy by the happiness of people other than their family members. They will be satisfied  by helping other people by fulfilling their needs and their dreams, sometimes by saving lives. These people work hard to for the improvement of human lives and getting happiness with that. So, in my opinion, people are more likely to be happy with their personal goals than the happiness of others in most cases.
