       The success is the scale to evaluate a person or an organization outcome and result. The success is essential to move forward and sustain in any field. To get the success everyone follow different strategy and formula. But as far as the strategy in aethical way it values the success. 

       There are mainly two kind of factors generally people follow-up which are Competion and Co-operation. Again it all about state of mind and team play. Both of it has own way of explanation and justification. I am mainly intense to explain the competition here. 

     The goal to reach will always need some stimulation. The stimulation comes from from different way for different prespective people. The competition always gives motto, energy and pulling power to run forward. But at the same time competition should in healthy way and it should not bring jealous or envy towards the opponents. Regardless of the competition by internal or external it always motivates and helps to increase the performance. 

    The cooperation is always important to achive the goal especially as a team. Without team work it is rarely possible to get success in competitive world. It will be a moral support to up and down of way path. It requires all the role has to play equally right from top management to bottom level workers. 

 So the competition will induce you to bounce back from the set back and difficult time. It always leads to success whenever in a healthyway. So I myself beleives that success is obtained mainly from the competition. The easy way to access the success is healthy competition.
