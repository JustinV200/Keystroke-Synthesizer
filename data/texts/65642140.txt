Materialism. We hate to admit it but we all are materialistic. Humans want expensive, flashy things because deep sown it makes us feel like we're worth more. Now, does that mean we should be criticized for it?

Yes, we should be criticized for being materialistic. Being materialistic can turn you into an ugly person.  I was criticized for being materialistic once and it actually was a life changing moment. Long story short, I had told my mom I wanted this expensive purse and she asked me why. I told her because I thought it was pretty but she starerd at me for a sceond and asked me again. "No, why do you truly want it?" I looked at her. She knew and I knew deep down I wanted it so people would think I had a lot of money. She then began to criticize me for thinking these things would bring me status and happiness when in all reality I was sad and pathetic.

Now I know what you're thinking. "What if I like materialistic things?" "It's my money so know one should even be in my buisness." It's fine to have nice things but you can't let it consume you. Humans automatically think that since they have nicer things than someone else that makes them better, which is absolutely wrong.

Materialism wasn't such a big thing back then as much as it is today. Social media, celebrities, music artists, professional sports players, and so much more are some of the reasons we are materialistic. Seeing them post their cars, jewlery, and money makes you want to go out and buy those things so you'll be important like them.

At the end of the day, materialism is bad and is going to lead you down a path of greed, pride, and ugliness. I think we should be criticized for being materialistic because maybe if we were, we would see how much we idolize money, cars, etc. Try not to put so much value on things that won't matter in 100 years. Focus on living life with what you have and being okay with that.
