Today's happiness is to buy more and more. In other words, materialism is the key of happiness for most of people. The world is designed to produce faster so people should spend money to buy the produced products. The economies depend on selling and buying stuff. People purchase more and more stuff even if they do not use them. Who is guilty in this situation? People or the economies that forces people to buy more stuff and show on the Instagram or Facebook.  

The modern economies in these days depend on production, imports, exports and selling. In order to have better economic conditions, modern societies encourage people to buy more stuff. Do we really need more stuff to be happy? I want to ask yourself " Are you happier when you purchased another pair of shoes even if you have 20 pairs of shoes?". If I asked this question to myself, the answer will be yes, it will make me happy on that day or week. What about two month later, I want to buy another pair of shoes because the other ones are old. Do I really need another pair of shoes? Am I using each pairs of 22 pairs? Of course not, but I want to have it, I like them, I want to keeep them, and I want to show my new shoes on my social media accounts. Some of my friends won't be happy if they don't show new shoes to their friends. 

In conclusion, buying products makes people happy for a moment and it is not continuous and real. It is necessary find another way to find the real happiness. Also, this not only depend on people but also depend on governments and economies. Governments should lead their communities to save more to construct better  and sustainable economies that not only encourages materialism but also encourage real happiness.
