Modern society is labeled as materialistic ofcourse i agree. Every little thing has been spoiling and  branded as modern society. Day by day we are losing our culture, happiness, originality in the name of modern culture.Till 90's everyone spend time with their families, friends and relatives. Nowadays even we can't spend time with momma and dad. Every people addicted to mobile, laptops, etc...

Modern society born to destroy people's relationships with everone. Just like that  mobile phone's sucking our time and feelings for others. We can't able to find humanity. Only because of modern  culture. Even some kids addicted to mobile's getting bad knowledge regarding society. 

Some of the adults get easily depressed, stress, unwanted tensions etc. They are ready to risk their life  because of this unwanted technologies. long ago we always share our day-to-day activities with our family. But no one ready to with witheir kids/adults to hear whats going on their life. Every individual just looking the life that being single and independent is only freedom. Perception about life is too negative with today's generations.

I hate modern society. I feel like im not belonsg to this universe. Such a terrific way technologies have been ruining our lives.  So i will never accept this modern culture. I'm just trying best to save my family, kids and every people around me should not get spoiled by this modern society. People's are not ready to face any kind of problems they are only escaping from the reality.
