Material things are acquired through hard work and some lucky ones inherited. Should modern society criticize people over their accommulated material things acquired through hard work or inhiritance? 

My answer is no. Society should not criticize people who acquire material things. People acquire things to satisfy their needs and wants in life. People work hard to support their basic needs and wants and they should not be criticized. 

If people acquire wealthy through dishonesty, then they should be criticized.  If people acquire wealthy and waste, then they should be criticized.

Acquiring wealthy and use to satisfy your needs and give back is a good cause.
