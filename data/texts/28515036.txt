In modern society, images and impressions definitely have an effect on people and the way that they view things.  Often times, the package is more important than the actual contents within.

A really representative example of this is in the arts, where the way a performer looks is often more important to consumers than the actual talent that the artist possesses.  In recent years, many of the most popular and successful singers do not possess what we classically think of as musical talent. In fact, their voices on their own are really nothing special.  Instead, the artists focus on their image first and their talent second.  An artist with very little musical ability can be catapulted to great stardom with a great team of people helping them manage how they look and the visual appearance that they present to audiences.

Of course, some might dispute this and argue that real singing ability is the key to success.  While this is certainly true for some amount of success, this argument just does not hold up when we examine the artists that have gained the most fame and fortune.  For the superstars, the ones at the very top, image is a big part of their success, and this is becoming more prevalent as stars become more accessible through social media and the Internet.

Images and the way things look definitely affect how people feel about and view things.  As consumers, how we feel about something is largely dictated by what we see, and we will continue going in that direction unless we start to look beyond images and try to see what's underneath.
