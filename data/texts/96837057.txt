The modern world would be a better place if we focused less on materialism and more on pursuing meaningful experiences and connections. The crazed emphasis on obtaining more things is just a band aid for a spirtual void we are experiencing in this day and age. While the thrill of getting something new is exciting at first, the newness eventually wears off and then it is replaced with an urge or hunger to buy something else that's newer. And then the cycle continues over and over until one eventually dies.

On the other hand, it is necessary to obtain material goods in order to live a comfortable and efficient life. Material goods provide many of the creature comforts we've come to know and love. Most people would be correct in saying that closets full of clothes, rooms full of furniture, and shelves full of appliances are little luxuries that they would be unwilling to go without.

It seems that the best way to work around the spiritual void of rampant materialism is to infuse it with a bit of intention. Invest more in material goods that will stand the test of time. Pause before mindlessly adding things to one's cart, either online or in physical stores. Are we purchasing things we love or are we purchasing things to fill space in our lives? Material goods cannot and should not be avoided entirely, but we can add a bit of meaning to each purchase.

Modern society shouldn't be criticized for all of its materialistic tendencies. But it should take a step back and ask itself if perhaps the balance is askew and needs some adjusting. There is a way to enjoy the material pleasures in life, but only if we couple that with a deeper, spirtual relationship with the world at large.
