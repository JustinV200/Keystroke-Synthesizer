   Images and impressions have a great effect on people. In fact, most people base most of their opinions on images perceived through the media. Politicians are notorious for making their name through imaging. Promotions, debates, and fundraisers not only raise awareness of the person, but it automatically instills ideas about that person, even though we have not seen their actions yet.
   Another way images effects people is through television. From a very young age, we are taught various lessons through TV shows and movies. Kids are often taught the alaphabet and how to count, as well as how to handle social situations. As adults, we are still effected through television. We are taught that certain things are acceptable because they are normalized on our favorite shows or movies we endulge in. In some cases, we tend to accept unacceptable behavior from people because we can been taught that it is normal through images. 
    Besides images, impressions also effect people in any ways. If you try a new restaurant for the first time, and experience a bad dining adventure, you are not as likely to return in such a hurry. You may also tell your family and friends about this experience. They may formulate an opinion about this place that they have yet to try, based on your impression of them. As you may conclude, images and impressions can majorly effect people in all regions.
