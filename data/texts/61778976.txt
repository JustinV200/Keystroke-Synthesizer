           Success comes in different forms. In some cases, success is made by coming together as a team and every one rolling up their sleeves for the greater good. In others, successes come from staying in your own lane and learning from the mistakes of your counterpart. In my opinion, people acheive more success with competition. This is because from competition you're able to learn from there mistakes and from paying intention to the failures of competion you are able to align more innovative way to acheive the goal. Ive seen this in so many ways between companies.
           To begin with, I believe competition exudes success because you are able to learn from the mistakes of the competiton. For example, McDonalds created the value menu for things to be priced lower than retail value. It was create business was up for them they were very successful. But then Wendys came out with the 4-4-4 value meal which in fact provides more value by giving you 2 entrees a side and a drink for arguably less than the value menu that McDonalds created.
           Secondly, Competition allows you to be more innovative with acheiving said goals. For example, before wendys came out with the 4-4-4 meal they allowed McDonalds to go through trial and error of marketing and pricing. From monitoring McDonalds and other companies with the same business module they found a more innovative and unique way to catch the customers eyes. From this McDonalds, value menu is basically the same price as the regular menu. But Wendys however has found ways to create more value in there value menu with including full priced menu items at a low price.
