          In my experience , focus on service to others. In other words, do focus outward without becoming codependent. happiness depends to some extent on self esteem and that comes from service. Some  people however, who suffer from the terrible illness of depression, might find that their internal happiness is blocked by some chemical imbalances in theur brain, which prevents their happiness from coming out naturally.

            I must say that the disappointment of not always reaching our goals might make us feel sad sometimes and for a while , but again. our bodies have a natural ability to deal with that sadness so that it does with that sadness so that it does not prevent us from being naturally happy.Maturity brings control over one's emotional abilities. the older we get the less we are influenced by disappointments,and the more stable our happiness becomes.

              It is impossible to imagine anyone getting happy when he consistently fails to achive what he desires in his life. we all feel happy only when we succeed in getting what we want in our life.happiness is not something which is available in the market,which can be purchased and given to you.It is the condition of mind when you achieve what successes in your internal and external domain.
