    I believe that happiness comes from the pursuit of one's own goals. I believe this for two main reasons: most people find more happiness in the pursuit of their goals, than after they've achieved their goals. Second, not everyone is in a position where they can help others, or improve humanity. To focus your happiness on making other people happy can lead to frustration and disappointment if you find yourself unable to help other people, but almost everyone finds happiness in the pursuit of their personal goals.

Most everyone can agree that working towards a goal, and making progress towards it is a great source of satisfaction and pride. Whether it's achieving a degree to start your career, or working on a project you're passionate about, it's human nature to want to achieve great things, and to enjoy making progress towards those things. It's undeniable that pursuing your personal goals will bring you happiness.

While focusing on bringing happiness to other people, or improving humanity as a whole are noble goals, and indeed can bring great satisfaction when achieved, they aren't possible for all people. If you grow up in poverty, there are simply more obstacles to helping people and improving humanity. A billionaire can easily help far more people than someone living paycheck to paycheck. For this reason, if your happiness is dependent on bringing happiness to others, and helping humanity as a whole, your ability to actually achieve happiness is mostly up to chance. Pursuing your personal goals is simply a more reliable source of happiness, since it's one that anyone can achieve.
