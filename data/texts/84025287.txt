People, on a human level, receive more success by coopration than by competition. I am a fan of the writing of famed evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and he addresses this in one of his books. He says that yes, we have the so-called "selfish gene", but that the emphasis needs to be on the word "gene", not the word "selfish". That is to say, while there are some evolutionary incentives to be selfish, they are not the only incentives. To support this, Dawkins speaks of symbiosis, wherein different species gain mutual benefits from one another.

Success is hard to define, though, and it takes many forms. Some forms will be helped more by competition, some by cooperation. For example, in a free market, competition drives innovation. We therefore can achieve more success by reaping the benefits of companies competing with one another to create the best products. But on the other hand, we gain a great deal from cooperation with our fellow humans. Think of social movements that have spurred massive societal changes. They happened because large amounts of people decided to cooperate in pursuit of a common goal. The Civil Rights Movement in the United States found its success through cooperation, not competition.

Both cooperation and competition are important avenues for human advancement and success. However, we get more out of life if we are able to live symbiotically with one another and work towards common goals.
