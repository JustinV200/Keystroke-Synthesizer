                           Should modern society be critizied for being materialistic? 


It is my person opinion that no society should not be critized. While there are definetely some drawbacks to this I feel that it is no ones buisness if someone wants to be materialistic or not. If I want to spend $200 on a pair of jeans it is not harming anyone else nor is it anyones buisness how much I spend. If I want to have a nice house and nice cars and live "the good life" and I work hard to earn the money to afford these things then it is no one's concern on how I spend my money. 
 That being said should people work to be less materialistic? Probably. People should try to help the needy and give to charity. Perhaps we should stop buying so many things to help other people. Maybe we need to find a better balance. But the bottom line is it is no ones buisness if I should choose to not do that while people are judging others for being too materalistic and spending money on things they feel are unncessary or a waste what they might not know is that while someone might be living in a huge house and driving a BMW they also might be giving a large portion of money away each month to charities and helping others. 
 In conclusion people should just mind their own buisness on what others do. If your friend/co-worker/friend of a friend chooses to spend tons of money each month buying frivilous items then that is their preogative and you should just mind your own business.
