The Olympics, The Super Bowl, The World Cup; these are all things to achieve through victory and competition. I think these kinds of motivations help individuals achieve success. They know, through hard work and determination, they can be on top. Sometimes it's individuals that can be the main driving force behind a project. Many great inventions have been discovered by a single person, who was motivated enough. I have found, on many occasion, other people can detour you from your goal when trying to work together. As such, I've always had more success as a leader.
Other people may claim, that to achieve such high goals, you need a team behind you. They don't realize that there is always still going to be a star player, a MVP, ect. If Bill Gates cooperated with every offer or company he came across, he wouldn't be the man we know today. You may think mergers or big companies rebranding are good examples of cooperation at the highest level, but really this is just the bigger company buying the competition. Nothing could be accomplished, on a team, without a strong leader. To become a leader you must pass many test above others.
In all regards, how you want to achieve success is up to you. However after those team victories, you may find yourself fade into the backround, not truly achieving anything. It's better to drown out the competition and take charge. For you never know who is going to try to take your spot. We're all in competition on a daily basis, whether or not we like to admit it. Are you going to be late? Will you get that promotion over Josh? Is your partner still atracted to you? It goes on and on. That is why I believe in always being on top and winning at life. Being number one will always be better than an unknown team member.
