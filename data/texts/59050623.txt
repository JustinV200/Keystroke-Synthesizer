The greatest achievements in human history have come to be because of competition. The space race between the former U.S.S.R. and the United States would have taken decades more if both countries had not kept one upping each other. Both countries had to be at the very cutting edge of technology to maintain any sizeable lead and what did that bring? Technological break through after technological breakthrough. In the span of just a few years man had not only sent the first satellite into space, but had also taken the first steps on the moon.

Sure, cooperation is neccessary for human survival, without it we would be lawless and anarchy would reign. However, cooperation is not the standard, it is a restriction placed on us so that the majority can prosper. We were not the first apes to stand upright. Before humans became the dominant species there were many competitors that vied for that crown. Where are those species now? Gone. Lost to the annals of time, known only to scholarly anthropologists. Had early man settled for mere cooperation we would not be here today and I would not be writing this essay.

The main take away here is that through competition is how the biggest and most important successes are made. Competition made humankind the top dog and competition took us to space and back. The next time a major breakthrough is made in any area look at the circumstances that led to it. Chances are there was a competition spurring it on either in the forefront or quietly in the background.
