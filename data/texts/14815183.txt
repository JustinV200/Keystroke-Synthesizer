I don't believe that the human race is focused on being materialistic.  We need what we want and most of us would like to have something better.  Especially, if we are the one's that have to pay for it.   Therefore, we go for something that we hope to be better and last longer.  This holds true for most of the items we have to buy, nobody wants to buy old beat up clothes or shoes, secondhand is good as long as it looks new.  There is a level of happiness in making a purchase that appears to be a good deal and there is nothing wrong with wanting better. 

I would like to purchase a house, at this time I don't have the skills to buy an old run down house and fix it up.  I would require something that is move in ready and therefore require more money to achieve this goal.  Face it, we all like nice things  but we have become a use it and throw it away society.  I walked to my dumpster this morning only to find dozens of surge protectors that could have been donated for someone else to use.  I don't believe that the person who bought them was materialistic but required them for office use.  However, we could spend some time buying and donating to help the planet.  

I need a better car to make my life a little easier, to get back and forth to work and anywhere else I need to go. I want something nice, not an old beat up hooptie that I'll have to keep shoving money in.  Having reliable transportation is a must for most of us and newer is better.  Suffice to say that having something newer is often better than having something old and worn out and that's just the way it is.  With new you may get a warranty and with the old comes that old saying, you bought it as is.  We don't need to be criticized for being materialistic, we need to be criticized for being wasteful and ignorant.  There is so much that we could reuse and recycle that it's really sinful to see so much being thrown away.
