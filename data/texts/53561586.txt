         I totally believe that cooperation will get you much farther in your life than competition.  I am a 70 year old retired female who possesses many life experiences, both personally and vocationally, and there is no doubt in my mind that interpersonal "people skills" and working with others to meet a common and mutual goal will gain you significantly more success than trying to do better than others.

         I feel that working with and encouraging others to join your team and adopt your beliefs are extremely important life skills.  These skills don't necessarily come naturally and need to be learned and improved upon over time.  One of the most important skills is to learn to listen carefully and sincerely to others. You need to keep an open mind and be willing to compromise, if necessary, to reach your common goal.  There is truly strength in numbers and working together with others will get you much further than competing against others.

        Although some people believe that competition is the spice of life and that it is better to win than to lose, my personal experience leads me to believe otherwise.  Most things in life are not absolute, black or white and all or nothing.  Competition can also result in bitter or hostile feeling among the players in the situation.  These feelings can have lasting effects on the self image and confidence of both the winners and the losers.  It is much better to learn to work together with others, think outside the box, consider all opinions and then work together for the benefit of the team or society in general.

         In conclusion, I personally believe that it is far more important to learn to cooperate with others rather than compete and be rivals.  If we adopt this approach in life, everyone can be winners!
