Introduction:
 Aware! Colorful things blind us and hide the reality under those colorful and attractive advertisements! Despite the fact that we know those advertising pictures aren't real, our brain will force us to buy it. A great comedy is, we'll do it on our own conciousness!

Reality:
First and foremost, we must recognise that they are human beings just like us, and that they too require profit for their living and to lead their life succesfully.
 We, like them want to make money, and no one wants to lose money on others. So, for our own safety, our goal is to flee as much as possible within the limits of our emotions. Bare in mind!

Evidence:
We all have purchased many pocket items for our daily needs, but many of us have failed to notice that the image in the pocket is not real that the image in the pocket is not real and is only for marketing purposes! They have mentioned it too! But it's our fault to notice it and we've to accept that!

Conclusion:
 We must look after ourselves, our economy, and our health! We should not be duped by enticing advertisements or by the words of our devilish mind! Be carefull and be cautious about what you buy and how you spend your money which you all get from your hardwork and time!
