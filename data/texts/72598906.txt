I believe that competition is the main driver for success in today's world. Everyone as an individual, company or country is competiting against each other to do better than each other and that competitiveness definitely drives everyone to achieve success. Look at all of the companies in the world that are competiting against each other. An example are the soda companies Coca-Cola and Pepsi. They are both huge soda companies that have been around for decades that have a similar soft drink but they compete against each other using marketing strategies and tactics to be number one in the world as the best soft drink.

Everyone is always competing to do better than each other in some way. Competition is seen naturally in nature itself when you watch documentaries about various insects and animals simply living life. You can see insects and animals, for instance, and how the males will compete against each other to obtain a female within their vicinity. The males will typically battle it out or compete in some way and the winner will get to mate with the female.

It's very simple and natural for competition to exist and to drive success in the world. Cooperation definitely helps to achieve success by a lot but it's always competition that drives others to do better than they did before. Competition can even be against only oneself to do better than they did before. It doesn't have to be against another person or entity. Simply trying to do something better than they did before is competition in rudimentary form. It's just the nature of the world and of living.
