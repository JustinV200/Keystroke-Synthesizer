I would like to say that we live in a wierd world today.  Everything we see isn't reality and much of it is made up.  Even some products that they sell are deceiving by there packaging.  I would say you can't believe everything you see, it may not be true.  Yes we live in a country where we have freedome of speech but it's sometimes is hard to know what is real.  On my cell phone I constantly get a ton of information that you do not know what is true.  Daily I am bombarded with fake News stories and even though people have the right to do this in America it is disheartning to say the least.  It's hard to know what reality really is so you just have to go by your feelings and what you know. It's so easy to believe everything you hear but you can't believe everything.

   I think way to much importance is placed on the elite people, such as athletes, musicians, and actors anyway.  You also get so many different views of what a Politician is really like.  With all of this out there I try not to take anything to seriously because you have enough of your own reality.  You have to do this to keep your sanity. 

As far as products you do have to read the box carefully to be able to tell if it's good or bad.  Also always check out the online reviews because this will give you an idea of what to expect from a product.  

When I was younger I went to a Catholic School and the Sisters used to say don't believe anything you hear and only half of what you see. So just remember this saying is true "It's still a beautiful world, strive to be happy." That is my motto anyway, there was a poem about this and it is beautiful I believe it's called the Desiderata". It's a beautiful poem and it says alot.
