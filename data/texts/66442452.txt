How can one achieve happiness?  This is an innate desire each human being seeks.  However, this desire is difficult to achieve.  Happiness can come and go.  Can happiness be achieved when one focuses on their personal goals or rather is happiness more likely if we focus on the happiness of others?

I would argue that happiness is likely when we take the focus off oursevles and instead direct our focus on others.  All people are searching for happiness despite their race or socioeconomic status.  Instead of being sponges, we were meant to pour into others to add meaning to their lives.  If not, we remain saturated and useless. 

Some may take a different stance on how happiness is achieved.  Some may attempt to achieve happiness by pursuing their dreams and goals.  Dreams and goals come and go.  What if ones dreams and goals never happen?  What if all of the dreams and goals are achieved.  What then?  Does this mean I'm no longer happy once I achieve my dreams and goals?  Am I absent happiness when my dreams and goals are never realized?  Goals and dreams are not certain and may or may not bring happiness for a period of time whereas pouring into others to achieve happiness is constant.

We were created not to serve only ourselves but rather each other.  The more we take the focus off ourselves the likelihood for happiness grows.  When we perform acts of kindess to brighten someone's day, it can't help but increase our inner happiness.  When the mentality of you first is adopted, it's a win-win for everyone.
