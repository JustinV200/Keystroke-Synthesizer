On a daily basis, we are perceptable to deception as we open ourselves up for it. Especially during this time when we're constantly taking in information, much of it being false without our knowledge. We tend to take things at face-value, although it's become easier to decieve people on the internet nowadays. 

Take for example pictures of UFO's throughout the decades. Altering pictures well was difficult in the 80's, and people believed the few pictures they saw that circulated, because how could someone fake it? But now pictures are much easier to manipulate and people are more cautious with what they take as true. It wasn't until the US government released evidence of actual UFO's that people took notice and started to believe in it in mass. Although people are more cautious of what can and can't be altered, they are still suseptable to being decieved.
 
With the most common downloaded apps being image based apps, it's no wonder this current generation is so image driven. We constantly consume image based data that it overtakes us as being such a priority. It creates a false perception of reality. Images only show maybe 10% of what is taking place in said image, but since it takes up a major part of our lives, we see it as the truth. It takes far too long to actually seek the truth.

At the end of the day, all there is to do is to be cautious of deception given how often we consume it. Our perception of reality shifts with the media we consume. It's easy to get carried away with a fact you saw online and just take it at face value, however there's a greater reward in seeking the truth.
