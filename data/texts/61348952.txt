Adverstising and marketing creates the demand for a particular product in our day to day life. some advertisments impress us without getting knowing about the advertising product, later we got to know the brand and its a smartest way of branding.

Branding is a clever way of creating a good profile among the audience irrespective of  its negatives. in some case some brands are seen as a prestige to use or buy eventhough its not worth that. not only products branding is also applicable among human especially among the politicians and entertainers. some of the entertainers who are better than the familiar one's are still not known by the people, familiar one is not defenitely talented than an unrecognized one. more than ability one's familiarity is decided by influencing strategies.

We all are living a life without realising what really matters. we are supposed to influenced by someother in someway. most among us do the things with other's thought and fearof other's opinion in mind. the saying "all the glitters are not gold" is example of what we all doing is not important than what actually matters. the importance of a thing should decided by and for ourself not by the influence and prestige among others. 

"apperances are deceptive" we need to classify the things using the sense of ourselves.
