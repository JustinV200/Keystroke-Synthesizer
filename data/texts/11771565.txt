Instagram Perfect! Facebook Ready! Tik Tok Followers.  In our society, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.  People love to show the world the pretty side of everything.  Whether it is their baby, child,  home, vacation, food or family.  They will stage things and show off what they are doing.  They will put on a pretty and positive spin on everything to show off to the world. 

When it comes to the entertainment world, celebrities love to show what they are doing.  One family that I can think of is the Kardashians.  Everything that they do is documented on social media.  It all looks so glamorous and fun and so many people want to emulate them. They make doing the most mundane thing look like they are having fun.  Its amazing how they built their brand and have made fortunes doing this. So of courese when you see a famous person, like the Kardashians wearing something or doing something, people want to do it too.  When you think about them, what are they really famous for? Being famous. 

Social media has really assisted in making images and impressions have a huge effect on people.  So many times you see something on Instagram/Facebook or Tik Tok and then you want to try it or purchase it.  Speaking personally, I have ordered multiple items from Amazon on products that I have seen on social media. They usually look better on line than when I get them home.
