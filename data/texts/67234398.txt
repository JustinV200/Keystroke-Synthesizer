Do you ever wonder why sometimes clothes do not look as good on you as they do on the person in the picture or on that commercial?  Why are things not always as they seem.   We live in a world that is controlled my media and especially social media.  Unfortuantely, not everyone has a body like the model on the screen.  In fact a pretty small percentage has that "barbie" body and therefore that cute outfit may not fit us all like it does the model.  We order it anyway and excitedly wait for its arrival only to be very disappointed that it doesnt look near as good as it did on her.  Then there goes the body shaming feeling that tells us we are not good enough and possible even depression to follow.

Unfortunately most marketing companies are always going to use people or items to make their product look its very best and as consumers we tend to get drawn into the glamor and glitz so to speak.  We see these things day in and day out which give our brains a challenge not to get roped into buying everything we see or think is cool.  We also have to remember that photoshop and other applications and programs allow media to manipulate ads to look way better as well.

We need to try to look at the reality of each product and ask ourselves is this product truly being represented or could it be partrayed alot better than it is.  Will this product look good on me or do I have the wrong figure for this product.  I always read reviews for any product I am buying to see how it is rated.  This will help alot to not get tricked into a disappointing purchase.

Being able to look outside the box and keeping a realistic view of all things on social media and marketing will save us alot of disappointment and product returns in the future.
