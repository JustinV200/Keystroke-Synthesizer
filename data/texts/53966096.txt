We are taught from a young age to do our best. For some, this results in an ability to participate in healthy competition, which can encourage hard work, promote self-growth, and aid in achieving personal goals. For others, the "do your best" mantra�along with other external factors�fosters an arguably unhealthy mindset. 

The idea that success can only be achieved by some creates toxic environments and promotes unhealthy social comparison. Cooperation - where success is achieved if everyone is working together toward a common goal - creates an environment where achievement is attainable for all - and ultimately results in more successful people.

Competitiveness, at an extreme level, isolates a large number of people and promotes the idea that success is limited to a lucky few. Cooperation is integral for social survival - and helps nuture the idea that we are all able to achieve.
