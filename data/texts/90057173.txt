Modern society has changed a lot because of the materialism most of us know about that and surviving with that and enjoying our life with it. Modern society criticism was found to be a boon to every individual.My friend John is working in an IT company as a sales manager. He struggled a lot because in this modern society he faced many criticism from the very begining of his life. After that he changed his thoughts about the society and became more materialistic in this modern world.Particularly this incident has made him to be promoted as the General manager.

In the modern society many people got criticized for being materialistic. But in this beautiful world we should accept it and go just like it without interruption.John has overcome from that and reframed his work culture, adapted and admired by everybody for his modern thoughts and welcoming behaviour which he got from producing more stuff and knowledge through energy with his materialistic idea.

Before few weeks I met John in a restaurant and he explained me that nowadays through this job he is helping the orphans children and that makes him very satisfied with his life. Modern society should be praised a lot because the criticism he faced has motivatied and made him to achieve great heights in life. When we love materialisim we never hate it. Through our possessions we should help others who are suffering and it was the true source of meaning to life. Materialsitic was found to be a better thing and should be used in the right place at the right time.
