  Materialism is costing our families. By this I mean families are not what they once were. Mothers are now forced to work outside the home and that is to pay for all the material things we believe we need. Everyone wants more stuff .better stuff but it comes with a cost. Time spent away from children is the cost. Mothers used to spend their days carrying for most of the things we now pay someone else to do. Cook our food, do our house work and watch our children.
  Mothers at home spent time with the children. They taught them their ABCs and sharing now the preschool teacher does that or the daycare provider. Family dinners were everynight at the table not a sandwich or take out in front of the tv. Children were feed wholesome homecooked meals not greasy chicken or pizza. 
  I know there are some exceptions and there are some mothers that need to work  like single mothers.  But if the man is working then we are talking working for you wants and not your needs. The materialism that is ruining families.   I know that you will probably say" I have to work." And I would say to you  that  You need food to eat .You dont need to eat five star,you want to. You need shelter . You dont need to have a great big house with extra bedrooms and bathrooms and  tvs in every room. You want them  And you need clothing. You dont need designer that is your want and not your need. If our wants wasnt so high for material things then mothers would not be working . I know there are exceptions and woman work for reasons other than material possesions but Im sure 85% if you truely look at their finances Its the materialism that they get from working that keeps them in the workforce
