In my opinion, people achieve more success by competition. competition makes people always better than others and oblique people to best and make ourselves. People making our best effort and never stay the same. people always think different day by day to improve herself. They always create new ideas to improve her business when compared to others.   

As you help other ones, they will help you, but no one can make you successfull, it is on you only. Cooperation is the one of the platform for peoples. Coopeartion is important but it is not the clue for suceed. The clue to succed was competition, cooperation helped but was not the most imporatnt one. For example in a  cooperation company many peoples are working. in that place competative peoples only get achievement and move to next stages. Some other peoples always stay in the same place. the competative people work harder and move on.  focusing on competition make you give your best, therefore it conduces you straight into success.

Remember, when you start a new business or joining new work never to forget to have a people look on your competion, always try to beat them and you will be a successfull person in all places.  Thank you.
