Happiness can be hard to define and can mean different things to different people. Attaining personal goals and achievements can make you feel proud and acomplished. However, helping others atain their goals and spreading joy to them can make you truly happy. 

Giving happiness to others you care about is one of the best things you can do with your life. Personal goals are fine, but when you're old and alone because of what you had to give up to get those goals acomplished, you'll regret not considering others. I believe it was a greek proverb that stated a society is great when it's men plant trees who's shade they'll never see. Doing what is best for the improvement of humanity means some of your personal goals may not be met. 

The tragedy of the commons is a philisopical principle that uses a common area of grass and farmers to explain why shared resources are over used. In the same sense, if everyone only worried about thier personal goals and happiness the whole of humanity would be worse off. Shelfiness and greed will only get you so far. True happiness can only come from serving others and opening your heart to them.
