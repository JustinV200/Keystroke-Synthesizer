When one contemplates their place in the vastness of humankind past, present and future, one must consider what they consider to be real.  Since we are continually surrounded by various forms of media, one must ask what effect do the images and impressions we see have on our grasp of reality.    

It is my personal belief that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people, causing people to lose touch with reality and what it means to be an individual human.  This has been an occurence throughout time, especially with the advent of mass media - television, movies, print, etc. - but has really accelerated recently with the explosion of social media.  Companies and individuals being paid by companies create false stories and impressions that can lead to frustations of inadequacies by the receivers of this media.  This is especially true for vulnerable audiences like the young or the unaware who have not learned to be more discerning when experiencing these false stories and impressions.

People may argue that it is up to the individual to be more aware - kind of a buyer beware awareness - but I would counter that with what about the innocent people who do not have enough experience or education to see through the false sets of realities put forth on social media.

So it is my belief that it is our duty as parents, teachers, and friends to educate everyone we can in the reality that social media, along with other forms of media, often present a picture of unattainable perfectness that is actually far removed from reality and can be damaging to one's sense of self.  What is true and real are the things and people that surround you - the things you can see, touch, smell, hear and feel - not the fantancy images and impressions on social media.
