I think it's more true than ever, that what we see today in advertisement has a major effect on us. When we add social media to the mix it becomes abundantly clear that this is the case. Everything we see online is geared to entranced us to buy the needed item or service.

All social media tracks our movement online and uses this information to lead advertisers to sell to us. I see this everyday when I'm online. I can't miss it! It can become really difficult to search the web without being lead to follow a link for some product that goes on and on about what it can do for us.

These impressions get tangled up with what we really would rather search for online. For some times these advertisments are good for me and I like that there are there for me to look over. I feel I can be in control of what I would need and not need.

To conclude I feel the overload of images we see online can be out of wack. Much like a kid game of telling a story to one person than that person tells that same story to the next kid. By the time it gets to the last kid the story does not resemble any part of the really story. So too much information online gets completely distorted and does not make any sense. I always say what we see happening in real life in person to person is what's happening and not what's being presented on social media or with media figures.
