Yes, of course. Henry Kissinger said that perceptions are more than reality. It is an effect of propaganda and 'the guy in the labcoat (as proven by Stanley Milgram and Philip Zimbardo).' One can simply be appointed as something even if it is not true, and 'flash is made more than substance.' In the western hemisphere, we live in the most powerful propaganda network the world has ever seen.

For example, how we dress. We are constantly made to look and be a certain way, regardless if it is true, in polite society. I can be perfectly qualified for a job, but, if I come in looking like a normal person, I am not getting that job. If I come in dressed as a business professional, I am probably getting that job. It is the same thing with images and impressions. One can look the part, but do they have the skills?

People also tend to project, so that is also a factor. If you use that to your advantage, that can make you a master Public Relations Manager/ Propagandist (via Edward Bruneis, founder of today's public relations occupation). If one perceives you as "the best" in appearance, they are more likely to see you that way, even if you do not measure up in skillset necessarily, at least for the time being. 

We see it in "the news" as well. "Corporate media" is nothing but government media. There's no doubt about it. We just have the proof now, and the overall picture, due to information coming out. In previous generations, the citizenry knew.
