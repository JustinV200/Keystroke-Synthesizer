     By human nature, people are more likely to be competive in nature in order to achieve success. By being competitive, we act alone in our decisions and reap the benefits of our actions. When we compete with others it brings out our best talents and strengths. When competing, there is a mindsight that you cannot fail, thus giving your best to achieve the goal. 

     By contrast, when working with others you risk failure of the whole group. If members do not actively contributre, pull their own weight, or rely on group leaders, this significantly reduces synergy and the blending of ideas. Although working with others from different backgrounds allows for new ideas to evolve, this may also create tension as people may feel strongly in what they believe in and may find it to difficult to compromise or listen to others. If there are clashing ideas, it may be difficult for the group to move forward, therefore delaying progress and not reaching the desired goal(s). 

     When competing with others who are alike, it creates a fair environment. Each indiviual is using their own knowledge, skills, and abilites to accomplsish their own goal or victory. If they fail, it is a result of their own fault and not those of a group which elimiates finger pointing or ridicule. Being competive allows individuals to learn how to make decsions on their own when time is a constraint.
