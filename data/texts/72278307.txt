     People have long argued whether happiness is found in pursuing your own dreams and goals or if happiness is found in helping others.  Point and counterpoint can be made for each side but I have long subscribed to the belief that true happiness is found in service of something bigger than yourself.  True happiness comes with a peace of mind in knowing that you set your own goals aside for the greater good of family or community.
     Humans since the damn of time have been a social creature and always contain themselves within family units and groups.  This innate need for social interaction only makes it apparent to me that happiness is truly achieved in service of the larger good.  Not only do these things bring about happiness but they also serve to push society forward on the whole.  It seems as if it has almost served as an evolutionary tool that serves the dual purpose of providing personal happiness and serving a positive function for the societal groups.  
      On the other side of the spectrum is the pursuit of happiness thru self service.  This concept on it's own merit has always been viewed as negative and for good reasons.  Throughout history it has always seemed selfish to chase your happiness thru your own ambitions and interests.  It doesn't even leave the individual with a lasting sense of happiness before they are on to the next pursuit.  It's fleeting, rings hollow.
     So looking at the above we can come to the conclusion that serving the greater good is the clear cut path to happiness.  It's the only path to happiness that allows for a lasting happiness and helps your fellow man.  The idea on it's own is also the most worthwhile.  Given both options, happiness thru the greater good is the more altruistic of the two ideas which means it has the greater possibility to do more good for a greater number of people.  For me, that's all I need to know.
