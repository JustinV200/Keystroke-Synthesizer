I believe people achieve more success by cooperation rather than competition because teamwork can play a role in how tasks are achieved and by cooperating, more is likely to be done in a given time.

Cooperation can help people acheive more success. People acheive success by cooperating because while multiple people are working, each person can be assigned to a specific task. Each person is expected to fill an important role in order to mark something as comleted. 

If people work harder and get what is done, this will help achieve success. If it were to be competition, everyone would not be supporting each other along the way. This would lead to a lot of greed and not teamwork. 

Teamwork is an important concept when reflecting upon success rates. If everyone is working and cooperating, more is expected to get done. The more people get done and accomplish will determine how much success a person has and is willing to have. 

As you can tell success is very important to cause achievements. Without success, no person would achieve anything in this life and we would not be smart on how to work and collaborate ideas with others. Success leads to small, but big victories. 

People will acheive success one way or another. Engaging in competion allows people to rule over themselves and win. How do I submit this essay? Do I have to write for 21 minutes?
