Images and impressions have effects on people as they easily grab our attention. We can draw immediate attention of the people by images, photos of celebrity etc.,. Also if images and impressions are made colorful, it grabs the attention of kids too.

Right from stone age, human beings used images and impressions for communication before proper language development. As such our brain is more alert to the images, pictures and process it at the earliest. Even during our school days or nursery days one used to love colorful books rather than one with plain theory. Teachers use images, impressions to convey, teach the theories to the kids because human brain learns very fast by that way. In offices also, everything is presented in pictures, bar charts and diagrams for quick and easy understanding. All big tasks are breakdown into flow charts to convey them properly. Traffic signs are represented in images more often because our brain can process it faster while driving at high speeds.

So, this is being used by the media to use to their benefit by showing public figure. Even if we do not know or have full knowledge on the product will buy them on seeing the public figures as we are more connected with them.

So, I strongly believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people as we humans are related with it in our almost all daily activities.
