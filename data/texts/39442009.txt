An interesting phenomenon that influences everyone is how marketing  images and media effect how we think of people or things. How things are either shown or talked about can change how we view them subconsciously. It can be simple things like the use of bright coloring or lighting to the tone media uses. We see it from eevry day mundane products to even how we view politicians. 

While some people may arge that using such tricks can not possibly change how we think of something. Citing how once a persons mind is made up there is no changing it through such proccesses. Or they think people are too smart to fall for such trickery. 

In reality there have been studies that do show how certain colors or lighting can and do change how the brain precives them. Like how warm colors can have a calming affect on a person or how bold colors can either attract or highten awareness of  on object or surroundings. Just like lighting and colors the tone in which something it talked about can also change how we feel  about them. Harsher,loud and negative tones can make one feel negative about  a subject while upbeat,calm and lighthearted tones make us view things in a positive manner. 

These tricks are uses all around us everyday without us noticing it. From billbords, magazine ads,tv ads to news programs,public speakers, even our teachers. I belive it is important for us to aknowledge these things so we can filter things through our own perspective and see if how we think or feel is is due to our own thoughts and feelings or becuase we were made to think and feel that way in the end.
