Materialsim is a part of everyons life, and there are people who find the need to criticize some for being to materialistic. Do I think they should be criticize for it? No. We are all different in our own ways, and we all do things differently. 

There are some who find that more comfort in wealth and material things such as clothing, shoes, money and so on. While others are more into enjoying spiritual and culture things. Like spending time with family and friends. I think we all like to spend money, but there are some who like to spend it on non important things.

There is nothing wrong with either side. Everyone has their own way of navagating though life. I am personally more of a culture and spiritual person. I think its important for everyone to at least try to connect with nature and put other things down for a while. I also like to spend time with my family. Put the phone down for a little while and connect with them. 

Now a days I see kids hooked to video games and their cellphone, who dont want to go outside and play and that makes me mad sometimes. Parents now a days are teaching their kids more about material possions, rather than having them outside and enjoying whats really important. 

Therefor, being to materialistic can be a problem at times and sometimes not a problem. I think whats important is know what really does matter and what doesnt. Knowing that you have family and friends and knowing that you cant take things like that for granted, because you can replace a shirt, or a car or even money. You however cant replace friends and family.
