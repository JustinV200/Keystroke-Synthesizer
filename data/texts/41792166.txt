            Yes, I think that modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic. We realy so much on our phones and computers. We also have turned to money and materialistic objects to keep us happy. This isn't always the case for everyone,however,it is a generalization we can make about modern society. I fear that in a few years,we may lose our sense of human nature completly and become materialistic cyborgs.
             Although technology has been an amazng contrbuton to society,people have made it too easy to do virtually anything on a computer or a phone. Children are starting to do simple addition and subtraction on calculation. Everywhere you look,people are on their cell phones,which are also becoming so ridiculous they are losing their primary purpose as phones. Most phones now include full keyboards,mobile internet,touch sereens,cameras, and even applications,where they only thing they REALLY need is the phone itself.
              We are also so consumed by cars,clothes,and other material objects. I will be the first to admit that I fall under the category. There is just some thing fascinating about cars and clothes,which makes me feel like I need to have as mouch money as possible so I can by the best of the best. I guess this has something to do with competition and drying to impress my peers. But it's also somuch more than that the powerful grace that comes with a beautiful,luxurious car never fails to leave me dazzled. The colors and textures of so many clothes is so beautiful to me. So I guess you could calla me materialistic.
