People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals. Personal goals are often aligned with our deepest desires and life purposes, and can be achieved and set in congruence with the happiness of others. Sometimes, even personal goals include or have an outcome that increases the happiness of others. While we are all individuals, we do have a group mentality and are influenced by our environment. Not everyone around us can be happy, and may have a negative effect on our happiness -- which is out of our control.

Happiness is fleeting -- most advise to tie it to a goal, not people or things. People can disappoint us and the thing we wanted may not be actually what we want. There is a proverb that states, "it's not the destination, it's the journey". While it's important to begin with the end in mind, we are responsible for putting ourselves on the journey and keeping ourselves on that path. Others cannot do that for us, and solely wanting to do things for the happiness of others leads to disappointment.

I firmly believe that people will be more happy and fulfilled and able to help others if they're focused and working on their personal goals, not solely living for the happiness of others. We must remember that we can only rely on ourselves to achieve our goals, sometimes with the assistance of others, but at the end of the day it's up to us to create the life we want to live. Only we can determine what makes us happy, not others.
