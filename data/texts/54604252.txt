Society should be criricized for being too materialistic. Even though we do live in a society where we need survive, material things are not everything. Society should not put materials in such as high value.  There are more important things in the world besides material things and money.

Society should enjoy the fruits of their labor. After all, they did work very hard for it anyway. However, materials things and money will not love you back in the end. Material things and money can get replaced and repaired. Happiness does come from one's own inner being. Society does put the love of material things and money way too far at times. It usually depends on what a person would do to obtain such material things and money.  Sometimes a person might have done something immoral and/or illegal to obtain such items and wealth. But at the end of the day, a person will lose such end gotten gains.

In conclusion, society should be called out being so materialistic. Society should realized what is more important to them. That no one should have to died to het such material things and money. What would society be willing to lose in the very end.
