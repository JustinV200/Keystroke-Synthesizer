All around us people are inundated with superficial impressions. From social media to billboards, the public's opinion is impacted by images and impressions. For some, the extent that images and impressions affect their opinions and beliefs is detrimental.
A basic example of people being affected by images is traditional advertising. Companies such as Nike and Adidas pay celebrities to market their products. This leads people to covet these shoes, not so much for their personal opinion of look or function, but for their belief that it will bring them clout and positive reactions from others.
Social media is another way we can see people being negatively influenced by images and impressions. Some individuals spend hours a day scrolling through newsfeeds. They see happy people, perfect familes, exciting vacations, and more. The person scrolling will naturally compare their life to those they are viewing. This can lead to a feeling of inadequacy and depression. They fail to recognize that they are viewing a superficial view of a person's life. Behind a happy family picture there may be fighting, cheating, and perhaps even abuse. Behind the glamorous lifestyle photos could be debt, depression, and posing.
In life, it is important to gain your happiness from within, rather thacfdghtftn from extrinsic motivators. Unfortunately, that is often not the case. Images and impressions often have too much effect on people.
