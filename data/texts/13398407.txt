   I think people are achieve more success through competitions and auditions because it is a competitive world and we see lot of peoples are well educated and extremly knowledged. cooperation is one of their success but it will not give full success. We must know the statistics of our world because in this world lot of peoples are selected through lot of competitions not because of cooperations.
   I saw one person in my life he is a hard worker and he never fails to do his work and he is very talented but still he wait for the oppurtunity to prove his own self to the world because this world expects lot form the individual. population is big so the competition also big in this society so we have to improve our skill and ability and must wait for the oppertunity. If we put hard work we will gain lot of success.
   cooperation in a group are cooperation in a team may give success but it was temperary. If we succeed through competition it will give lot of good advantages to our selves. It is really good to show others what we achieved or what way we succeed our goal. I think achieving success through competition is more better than cooperation.
