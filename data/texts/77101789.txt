As new ideas develop, many new improvements have changed our way in work and in life. Very few have attained achievements on their own. By joining like and unlike minds together, more people can achieve more success by cooperating to produce greater results. For example many people came together to develop new vaccines. Although maybe one researcher has found a cure, they are all working together in observing and testing.

Even though competiton is a major part of our lives, since we were born, we are encouraged to do our best. Some people are also better in certain things than others. Many people also thrive in a competitive environment. But if they are all brought together, their achievements can be even greater. One man's ideas in today's world can reach new heights when it is refined and further developed by a team. A person's weakness can be anothers strength, so this is a good way to remove any gaps in skills and makes less failure.

In conclusion, cooperating brings people together and helpes new ideas to form. This makes people more successful as a group. When people are in a positive cooperative environment they are less likely to fail than when put into a competitive enironment. Just like ants all work together, each with their own job, produces results for the whole colony.
