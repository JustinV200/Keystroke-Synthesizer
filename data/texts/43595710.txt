Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic.  In fact, it's not--the writing prompt starts with a controversial premise.  You are told to buy, buy, buy all the time and most people willingly (or aspiringly) acquiesce.  I get my identity from my brands is often taken as a given.  If that's you then you've got a problem and should be criticized.  Otherwise, aspiration is motivation, which is to say that wanting equates to doing.  And that doing is what moves forward both you personally and the world at large.  Nobody needs to apologize before or after the words, "I want."

So, who am I supposed to assume is saying that materialism is a bad thing?  Are ascetic monks now in control of popular culture?  Is hippie culture now making a comeback and we're all supposed to be living in rural communal cults?  Basic economics begins with a model of the circular flow, which tracks the flow of money between banks and businesses and individuals.  It can start anywhere and move in any direction.  But let's say you start with an individual who (unapologetically) says, "I want."  He gets a job at a business that pays him a salary that he puts in the bank to save for that purchase.  Or he gets a loan from a bank to make a purchase from the business that makes the item that he wants.  The money moves and all actors are happy.  It's called a healthy economy.

But, you apparently want me to say, can anybody really buy happiness?  That's not  the point.  Life is expensive.  Running naked among the wildflowers is a transcient pleasure (perhaps), but it does little to get you to tomorrow.  I am my things is inadvisable.  I buy to allay my anxiety is inadvisable.  But nobody every owes anyone an apology or explanation for wanting more for himself or his family.  In fact, asking others to accept less is usually the province of those who want more.
