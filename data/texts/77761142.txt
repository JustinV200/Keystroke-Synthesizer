While we all personally assume that we are immune from influence, any reasonable look at the culture in the last 10 years shows that images and impressions have too much of an affect on people.  This is best demonstrated via the rise of social media and it's affect on our culture.  

20-30 years ago, commercials were things that happened in the middle of TV shows and were fun to chat about the next day. Funny commercials like "Where's the Beef?" or epic Super Bowl commercials.  However, since the advent of social media, we are bombarded from everywhere with pictures, videos, influencers all vying for our attention.  What has been the result of this? We have teenagers with a rapid rise in body image issues. Viral TikTok challenges causing people to get hurt, or do destructive things.  People become obsessed with families like the Kardashians that are famous for no other reason for being famous.  We are all unhappier, unhealthier as a result of all the influence.   

It is not hard to understand. Humans are tribal, herd creatures. We crave wanting to be part of the group, to be accepted.  Going against the grain leaves us feeling exposed, vulnerable.  But that tendency also leaves us vulnerable to influence.  One need only look at what happened in Germany in WW2 under the charisma of Hitler or, closer to home, to the events of January 6th.  To go with the group, to succumb to the charismatic leader, those are very human things.

It is the bravest among us that go against the grain and resist the influence. Interstingly enough those are the ones that have the most significant influence over the long haul. Look at Martin Luther King protesting for civil rights agains Jim Crowe laws.  Or JK Rowling's current backlash against the culture war and assault on women's rights.  Perhaps celebrity influence can be used for good rather than for evil.
