To acheive our dreams,we have to be more focussed towards our target, we have to spend minimum time in other household activities and day to day routine. For instance, day to day activities like washing clothes, preparing food, dish washing, cleaning house etc. needs lots of time and energy. This time and energy can be saved by being a materialistic persons. Having machines for doing day to day activities will conserve more energy, time and make us comfortable.
