Competition can breed improvements and evolutions in many spaces. Capitalism for instance has created a very strong economy here in America. This can be imagery to show people grow through competition. Americans have more freedoms than many places. If a middle path can be found between healthy competition and the government still being able to take care of it's citizens America can build up it's citizens while maintaining growth through healthy competition. This shows healthy competition in America has created growth within it's economy, create self-reliance within it's citizens, and given the ability to take care of those with less.

Big companies in America create jobs for many of America's citizens. This allows each person who is gains a job at these places to grow through the companies growth. This is in part due to competition. These workers even have to compete for their place at the company. America's citizens are also self reliant because they know if they can put in the effort they can find a way to succeed. This all gives a trickle down effect where people get to be taken care of because there is prosperity through competition.

This all  shows through competition we can take care of each other. If strength is allowed to thrive then people can thrive also. Our government is only an example but healthy competition can create change through striving to be better. I am not saying do not take care of the people who have trouble, I am saying competition makes people strive for more and that we should always be trying to better ourselves which healthy competition promotes.
