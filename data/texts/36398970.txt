Most people would agree that cooperation is beneficial in most situations, but the intentions and end gains can be very different from person to person. Is cooperation used to just get ahead, or is it used to benefit others, or a team? And how does this vary between different types of senarios?

Some would argue that to get ahead as an individual and achieve personal success, competing with those in your field will get you their faster, which in some cases may be true. But working as a team and engraging in cooperative activies as a means to also help others can benefit an individual in ways beyond career or monitary success.

An example would be a team of individuals who are working on a particular task. By helping the other team members get ahead, you help foster a bond and develop a good workplace moral. This in turn makes then environment a much better place to work in, and you're more likely to have assistance returned when you need it. Getting ahead will be easier for you as you also help them progress.

The idea that a person should only help others as a means to personal success will hold a person back, not just on in their career, but in personal relationships and a decent quality of life. Life is more happy and satisfying when you have great friends, people you can trust, and have help when you need it, and cooperation is a definite way to achieving that.

In conclusion, success is subjective from person to person, though success without happiness and quality of life is bland and stale, and cooperation with others will lead to both material and inner happiness.
