Materialism is rampant in the modern society. It il love of  material things and loving to spend money on the material things. On my part, there are many things that are more important than buying and owning expensive material things.
Family and friends can make one's life a pleasant one. When for instace my  family is happy and together during holidays, it is the happiest momet of my life. I can not exchange that experience with material things. 
Health is also very mportant in making one's life happy. When my family has basic needs and healthy, it is far more important than having money or material things. Friends also make life meaningful. creating relationships with other people makes me happy.
People may urgue that material things are important because they give us a reason to work hard. This may lead to people working hard most of their time and accumulating wealth while they barely hae time to enjoy their success. Materialism is important but it should help us enjoy life rather than just accumulating the material things that money can buy.
All said and done, whichever way a person decides to follow, people should work hard so that they can enjoy their laves. Whether through materials or experiences.
