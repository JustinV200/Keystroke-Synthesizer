I do believe that images and impressions have to much effect on the normal person. Every day we see so many products marketing to us, using bright colors, showing off all of their new features, and using big name people to promote their products and I think it is having a negative effect on people. Some of the images that are shown to use are not in fact true in their natural, one example of this is food brands. Food companies prompt their food as looking perfect on the ads that they show us, but when you buy their food the food you reiceve looks nothing like the way they show it on their ads or commericals. I believe that is false advisterment, and has a negative impact on people and their notions on their food. 

Another effect that products have on people is when companies use certain celeberities or other high name people to prompt their product. The reason why this is not good for the average person, is usually the high name who is promoting the product does not use the item and is lieing to the public. People think the product is high end or that the high name person is in fact using the product but in reality they are not. And that can have a negavite impact on the person soon. I think the high name people should only prompt items that they truly use and not lie to the general public. 

The last point I want to bring up is companies using bright colors or big adjectives when descirbing their product just to get people to buy their product. Companies use these eye catching wors to draw in people, and these words make it seem like people need to buy their product to fully enjoy their life. When in fact they don't really need the product in their lifes. Again, I think images and impressions are to much of an effect on people and the effect is usually negative.
