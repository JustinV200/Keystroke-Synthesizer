Appearances of advertisements have a great impact on people but the items that these advertisements promote may not seem what they really are.  A lot of companies like to use famous entertainers, politicians or other important figures to promote the item they want to sell. The reason for this is because if a person is infatuated with a particular celebrity, the company will think that the consumer will buy the item because the celebrity is promoting it and if the celebrity uses the item, it must be good.  This in essence, is not always the case.

An entertainer can promote a weight loss product and rave about how much weight they have lost on this product. You see a before and after picture of the entertainer but technology can disguise images to make a person look smaller or bigger. The entertainer may have never tried the product but receives a lot of revenue from the company for promoting this weight loss product. This to me, is false advertising. The phrase, 'What you see, is what you get' is not always the case. 
   
My advice to people who are glorified with all these clever advertisements is to do your research. This will save you a lot of effort and time in the long run. By doing this, it will make you a better person and you can overlook all of these colorful advertisements and understand that it is all for show. The same is true for advertisers that use decorative boxes to store their merchandise. People are infatuated with this and will buy the product because the packaging is pretty.   No one can pull the wool over your eyes. You know fake from reality. You have woken up and smelled the roses.
