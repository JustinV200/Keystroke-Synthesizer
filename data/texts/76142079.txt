I'm not sure if we should be criticized for being materialistic, because being selfish and shallow has been a common element of many societies throughout history. We are sometimes inclined to think of success in purely material terms and judge each other based on incomes rather than our personalities and minds. 

I think it's only true that materialism is more in our faces today because of social media, but I don't think it's unique to modern history. Finding ways to flex and show off our wealthy has been common throughout history. People used to show off how rich they were based on what kind of clothes they wore (for instance, silk and deep rich dyes were used to indicate wealth and status) the food they ate and that hasn't changed at all. Hunting was also a common way that the elite in the past would flex and show off their elite status. 

To be certain, everyone makes a show of hating materialism, but rarely do our actions ever match what we actually do. There is a work of medieval literature, 
"The Romance of the Rose" by Jean de Muen that says, "So degenerate is all the world that it has put up love for sale."  This was written in the Late Middle Ages, but I'm sure that I could find people to agree that it's also true of the 21st century world. Thus, then complaints about materialism in society are not new and they have been a comment cause of controversy for a very long time. 

It is interesting to wonder what it says about humans that so many of us condemn materialism, yet we fail to live up to our own standards.

Thus, perhaps modern society should be criticized for materialism, but we should also recognize that materialism and selfishness have dogged societies throughout human history and we should not idealize the past and pretend that materialism is a new problem. There is ample evidence that it is not a new problem and we should perhaps be honest that this a common human failing rather than a purely and uniquely modern vice.
