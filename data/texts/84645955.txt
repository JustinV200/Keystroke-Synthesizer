     Materialisim is oftent criticized as being wrong.  The exact way that it is wrong is vauge and undetermined.  It is my position that materialism is not wrong but a resonable and useful thing in our society.
     When materialism started is an intresting thought experiment.  Persumably one caveman had a really nice stick that he used to hunt with.  Other cavemen were jealous, they could see the highly effective stick.  The quest was on for nicer and nicer sticks.  Persumably one caveman decided to make a perfect stick by removing material from a large stick.  So, now people do not necessarly hunt with sticks, some people make a living by finding sticks and others make a living by creating sticks.  A new class of person emerged, the critic.  Now a person can read reviews and find the best stick for his uses.  Everything we see in modern society relates to a better way to do some specific task.  The best computer to mine bit coins, the best dress to catch a man.  The computer, the bit coins and the dress are just alternate forms of the stick.  To accomplish something we as people need a object.  If the best object makes the job easier then it is useful. 
     Some people in society might not like the idea that we exist in a stick driven world.  It is completly fine for people to not like it.  Materialism is what created my stove and my refregerator.  Materialism is what keeps the shelves of the store filled with food.  I appreciate  having what I have.  I have no need to reach for fancier and fancier sticks.  Perhaphs the down fall of a materialistic society is when the critics turn inward and start making judgment calls on people.  If people keep focused on what pleases them, then every level of society can have whatever type of stick they like.
