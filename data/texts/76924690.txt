There is an old saying that says that "an image is worth one million words".  Unfortunately, these days due to the social media boom, this saying becomes very dangerous.  Images still worth one million words, but because pictures can be altered and staged, images can tell any story, including incorrect stories.

As people become more and more worried about what story their image is telling.  Personal looks seem to be more important than the essence of a person.   The manufactures of products are using more intricate and focused packs to easily sell their fabrications.   Beautiful and exciting might not tell the whole story, and even change the story showing unrealistic static explanations for a fact or product.   

The thruth is that people do not read as much as they used to read a few decades ago.   There are so many options out there, and our time is so limited to get as much as all the information "we can get" with the least time we have..  And for that reason, images are sometimes used as the only form of information one can get.  Some individuos, count exclusively on images to make their conclusions and decisions.
