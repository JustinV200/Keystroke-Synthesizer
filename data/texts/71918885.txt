I think people are more happy when they pursue other's happiness.  I absolutely believe in having your own personal goals and trying your hardest to fullfill them.  However, I do not think one can truly be happy if others around them are not happy.  Even if I succeed in a goal I set, I am not truly happy if it has a negative effect on my family.

For instance, I gave up my job and career to be a stay at home mom.  I love this decision but it has haunted me that I don't have that fullfilling career other moms have.  I have also been judged and teased about having a college degree but not working.  For our family, if I had continued to work, I would not have been around for our kids' activities and I would have been working nights and weekends for a lot of their childhood.  I feel like even if I succeeded in having my career, I would have kids in daycare all day, evenings without reading to them, and weekends spent at work rather than at their sporting events.  I feel their happiness and my own would've been lessened had I went for my personal goals.

With his job, my husband is busy, works random hours, and travels so that played into our decision for me to stay at home.  I think our kids would have spent a lot of time with other people in charge of them and would have had a lack of routine if I was working as well.  My job was demanding mentally and physically and I am sure I would have been exhausted after work each day.  That would mean it would be tiring to take care of kids, a house, cooking, etc. I fear I would've taken my frustration out on my family.

I am sure there can be a balance and I hope there's an easy fix one day where moms can be succesful in their careers and be full time parents while feeling they can give 100% to both.  I didn't feel I could do that, and I am happiest when my kids are happiest, so my decision was really a win-win situation.
