                             I would definetly accept the point that competition makes people more to get success. Because if we play a game or do anything without a competition we might get into the feeling of restness and ungoaled thus as a result we might get lazy and finish the work later or play the game without any cautiousness. And in the case of competitiveness our mind produces adrenaline at a high rate thus we focus more on the task towards success.
                            Example; basically i like to sing a lot and i thought that i am a flawless singer and i know all about the rhythm and pitches. Once, i participated on a singing competition during my high school, i haven't got selected even for top three, it taught me a lot that i am not a pro just a noob in singing. Thus by the next year i learned a lot and competed and got the first prize in the singing competition. If i haven't competed in a competition i would never got grown towards success.
                            This concludes that competition brings out the best performance from the people than they perform without competitiveness. This has been proven by every individual by themselves.  Thus people achieve more success by competition than cooperation.
