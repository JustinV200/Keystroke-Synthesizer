       Cooperation; is the process at which people feel happy to willingly work together to achieve objectives.competition; on the other hand is where people look  forward to achieve goals by their own, in this era the arguement that people should excel by trambling on others is loosing meaning, between cooperation and competion one need to choose the vehicle that is convinient and will result into long-term fuilfilment.
     If it is difficult to convince one which of the two vehicles is the ideal way to achieve objectives, that person should try both and reach the conclusion alone. The main question here is that why should one try the already tested and proved experiment? is it wothy for one to go all this trouble while there is already a tested and proved hypothesis? there is little that need to be done to anyone who doubts the result.
       Every successful story I have read almost all if not entire of them points me back to a collaboration effort, most milestone have been achieved due to team work, most innovative and creative ideas that has led most contries to succeed and be recognized globally is through cooperation effort. no single idea has succeeded that points back to only one person working a lone.
       It does not require rocket science for us to understand and appreciate the power of team work, cooperation enables people and organization to achieve their goals sooner than later. Competition lesads to envy jelousy and malice at our work place, team work fosters cohesion love unity and longlasting happiness, Therefore, cooperation it the ideal way to go for our success is pegged on how corperative we are. some one said that ''if yopu need to go faster walk alone but if you want to go far walk with others'', we all want to go far not just faster.
