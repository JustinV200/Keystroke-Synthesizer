Appearances are everything now a days. People believe that social media and likes are how well they are doing. We see it all the time in advertisments, the package is the important part to get you to buy it. The same goes for people if you are one of the influential people it really doesn't matter if you have a brain in your head. 

An example can be found watching the television program The Orville where people were able to get up votes or you had to go on a apology tour if you received to many down votes. If on this tour you got more down votes than up votes you were killed or had a lobtomy to correct your behavior. Our whole society is now based on our able to get likes. People feel if they don't have enough followers then they must be worthless. Our whole concept of ourselves is now about how we appear to others. It has become harder and harder to get people to understand how you feel about yourself is more important than how others feel about you.

Children who are growing up in the digital age are more concerned about their online influence than anything else. They need the reassurance that they are worthwhile from people they don't even know. Living in this reality is difficult to handle because if one person dislikes you then suddenly others pile on. Its bullying to the max level and yet it is an unrealistic reality because those online people do not really know you. In fact some of them will say mean things just to get a reaction or to deflect from themselves. 

If the internet were gone tomorrow how would society survive. It would certainly be a challenge to have to trust yourself again. To not worry about what appearance you are showing but what appearance is your true reality.
