                                                               Materialism of life



Introduction:   

     Don't be greedy for all things in life. Only the necessary things should be desired.


position:

     People today need to protenct money as much as they want too protect it. People spend huge amounts of money on luxury goods. We have to be aware to prevent it.


Reasons and evidence:

     My friend's family was in a lot of trouble. He fell in love with a girl and got married. The woman will desire to live very lavishly. When she goes to a clothing store and buys household items, she chooses expensive items. My friend's income was very low. To satisfy his wife, he borrowed from outside and met her needs. He got into debt problem and was very upset because he had borrowed a lot of money. One day when I went shopping I saw my friend and he told me all about the family situations. I thought I should make his wife understand that. 

Counterarguments and rebuttals: 

    I went to my friend's house and talked to his wife. I told her how difficult it is to earn a penny and if you spend lavishly instead of keeping the hard earned money of a day, your family will not be satisfied and there will be many problems. She argued with me so much that my husband does whatever he wants and argued with me that you should not interfere.

Conclusion:

    I put her on a job. She found it difficult to come and go to work and take care of the chores at home. He understood how much stress there is when we go to work. understanding her husband completely, she decided to save money and not spend extravagantly anymore. There was happpiness in their life. Form this it is understood that there should not alwaybe materialism.
