Materialism is a controversial issue in today's modern society. Some believe that materialism is a positive thing, while others believe it is a negative thing. Without a doubt, matieal objects and possessions are a large part of our lives. The question is, should we be criticizing the materialistic nature of our current society?

The answer is simple. No, we cannot criticize the materialistic nature of our society. People make a living making things, selling things, and using things. Things are what make up a large part of the economy. We need things, like clothing, cars, household supplies, and so on to survive in daily life. We need cars to get around to our jobs. We need clothing to look professional, clothing for being active, and clothing for special occasions. We need furniture in our homes to make them functional. We need toys to keep our kids occupied and out of trouble. We need dishes to be able to cook and feed our families. We need these goods, which means we also need people to make these things. People make a living creating the material objects we consume.

Others may say that we are just too materialistic. They may say that we buy and consume more than just the basics. This may be true, but who is to say what one person needs? Everyone has different needs based on the factors of their unique lives. We shouldn't judge those needs. And, if someone just wants something extraneous for fun or pleasure, why should we stop them. Afterall, they are just contributing to the economy for consuming those material objects.

In conclusion, we are absolutely a materialistic society. But, so what? Why should we criticize that?  The economy is supported by people buying and consuming what they want and need. Who are we to judge each other if we are happy? As long as we are living within out means and not causing harm to others, there is no need to criticize.
