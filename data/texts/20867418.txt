i saw two variety of people live in the world. one person kind and lovely attached all the people. but another person only thing about money and luxorius life. once a upon a time i saw that two kind of persons. the money oriented person is thing about only valuable things. that person is always busy at work and money oriented mind. she is not care about our family and she is not good thing.
one day her mother was sick at very serious condition in hospital. very critical position in heart problem. but she is very busy at work. she is not care about our family. afer that seroius condition her mother was dead. after her mother dead, she is came at home. she is all the time busy at work. materialism person is always thing luxorius life. 
after that one family love and kind person to see my life. that person always lover her family. she is very different kind of person. but this is not good for our society. 
but materialism person posision such as clothing, variety of jewels, veriety and luxorius dress. materilism person are acheived goals. she is take only happiness, success and desirability. lovable person are not important rich kind of people. finally succeed person are materialism.
