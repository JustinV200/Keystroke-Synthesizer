     Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.   Our society is too focused on acquiring possessions and spending money.  The proof is all around us, from social media and e-commerce to brick-and-morter stores across the country.  It seems at times that we are in a race as to who can acquire the most.  But do these material things make us happy in the long run?  Maybe, but true happiness is found elsewhere.
     Acquiring possessions and spending money has been around for centuries.  But, the rise of the internet has increased these habits in modern day society.  Everyday people are bombarded by ads, commercials, and social influencers encouraging us to buy, buy, buy.  Social media abounds with people showing their possessions and acting as if they are the happiest, wealthiest, most beautiful and fullfilled humans on earth.  Who even knows if these things are true.   
     Possessions and spending money can make happiness easier by limiting hardships, creating a harmonious environment, and allowing one to go on vacation and have new and joyful experiences.  But would these things be fun without someone you love to share them with?  Maybe for a while, but if one had to choose, would you choose possessions over people?  
     I believe with all my heart that modern society has put too much importance on spending money and acquiring material items than focusing on more fullfilling parts of life such as one's relationships with God, family and friends.  I know if I had to choose, I would pick love and relationships over possessions.
