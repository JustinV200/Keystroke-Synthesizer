People often define happiness as one of their biggest goals in life. There are differing opinions on how one can obtain happiness.  Some think we become happy by focusing on others or mankind in general, while others believe happiness is obtained by pursuing personal goals and fucusing on themselves.

True happiness is really only possible if one tries to increase the happiness of others and all of humanity.  Firstly, one does not exist in a vacuum and so can only truly be happy if the people around him/her are also happy.  Secondly, happiness is contagious, so spreading it to others increases our own happiness.  An example is when one starts laughing, often others follow suit, even if they don't know the source of the laughter. Additionally, there is almost nothing more fulfilling and satisfying than helping improve the lives and happiness of those around us, which in turn increases our own happiness. 

Although an argument may be made that true happiness only comes from accomplishing personal goals, this does not hold up when attaining one's own goals at the expense of others.  While others are suffering, one cannot feel complete happiness personally.  Pursuing personal enlightenment can be satisfying, but cannot replace the euphoria of making a positive impact on the lives of others.

Personal happiness can be enhanced by pursuing personal goals or by helping others obtain their own goals or shared goals.  However, the greatest personal happiness can only be obtained by also increasing the happiness of  all others who share our world.  Let's get started!
