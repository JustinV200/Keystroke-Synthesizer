     Cooperation or Competition, which produces Success? In today's world, working with others to get to the main goal would be considered cooperation. Competition is shown by each person trying to beat or do better than the others. Each works toward success in it's own way. 
 
     Cooperation helps people feel part of a team and a common goal. At the end the task has been completed with all parties having input. This helps everyone with the buy in. They all feel responsible for the success since they all had some input.  Competition lets all parties strive for greatness and not get complacent by just contributing the minimun while the team contributes more. With Cooperation, one could sit back during say, brainstorming and just give 2 ideas since the others would also be giving many ideas. With competition your brain would exhaust all possible ideas with the thought that you would want to come up with a better idea than your competitor.

    I can see how cooperation seems to some, to be better than competition when trying to accomplish a goal since it leaves everyone with the winning feeling. No one feels like they lost or has hard feelins.  However, the way my brain thinks, competition makes one work harder.  When you're competing you're trying to outdo someone else. It's human nature to want to win.  When your cooperating sometimes you have to back down on your thoughts, like a give and take situation, to get to the goal. When your competing you never back down or change your mind on what you think is right.
