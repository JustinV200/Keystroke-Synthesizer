I believe that happiness can be found in multiple ways. For example as i am a mother i find most of my happiness by taking care of my children and making sure that they are happy. But what works for me might not work for others. For some their happiness might only come by focusing on their personal goals. They might be very career orientated and by pushing their careers to its highest limits they might find that is the best way to their happiness. Another person might find that by helping others in need could lead them to a greater source of happiness. 
Finding happiness ultimately depends on the kind of person they are and what kind of lifestyle they lead. Work orientated people will generally always aim for their own personal goals. Whereas majority of people who are at lower incomes or just parents as such will sometimes aim for splitting their happiness. 
You can sometimes find that by choosing to both work your personal goals can also lead you to helping out with the happiness of others. So in my opinion i think people can find more personal happiness between both it all depends on what kind of person they are and their lifestyle.
