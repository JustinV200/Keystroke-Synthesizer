What happens is that being materialistic creates a false sense of happiness for a short moment because we are conditioned by the media to think we need more and better things. We get these things and it can bring a few minutes or maybe hours of joy. This makes people think that they were getting more joy than they actually were and it becomes like a drug people become addicted to.

They think it will ake them happy or make others think they are worth more as a person than they actually are.
