Happiness is something most people strive for in life. But what is happiness? How do we attain it? This answer can be different for each individual . Some people find happiness in their accomplishments. Others believe it is attained by focusing  on others - wether individually or humanity as a whole. I believe there is no wrong path to happiness, but there is absolutely a bettter way to find it. 

Focusing on yourself, fulfilling your dreams and goals will bring happiness from within. When you find happiness in yourself, no one can take it from you. Feeling happy from within enables you to go forth and project that happiness in the world. People want to be around people who are happy. Who would really want to spend their time with a miserable companion? 

It's true that some people find happiness in focusing on the happiness of others. It really feels good to make someone smile. It's a great an noble attribute to genuinely care about others. However, the problem with depending on other people for happiness is that you have no control. There's no guarantee that there will always be people who need or want your help. You can put all of your effort into making others happy, but you're left with nothing tangible to show for your effort. How long does that happiness last? Until you find another person in need, you have no control.

There is no right or wrong way to find happiness. There is nothing wrong with attaining happiness from helping others. However, finding happiness from within is essential. It's important to help yourself so that you can help others. Happiness has positive effects on your health, both mentally and physically, and helps boost self esteem. When you are your best self, you're in a better position to go forth and spread that happiness to others, which in my opinion, is the best of both worlds.
