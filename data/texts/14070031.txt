Speaking about appearances being mistaken for reality, that is an individual perception.  It is up to the individual to determine and discern appearances from reality.  We are often quick to jump on the first thing that we see, rather than doing the research and founding out what is important to ourselves.

For marketing, packaging is important, it is what is done to catch the consumer's eye.  You have to decide and determine what you want and what is should and should not do that is going to benefit your desired results.

Taking about media, some entertainers, politicians and other people do have the talent and ability to perform they desired job or request.  So I do not like to catergorized all people in this group.  Eventually our talent and ability will come to the limelight.

You can only be as good as you really are. You can only fake your skills and abilities for so long.  At some point along the way, your true skills and abilities will come out.

So saying that appearances are mistaken for reality, in some cases this can be true.  But at some point, each person needs to know their own moral and values.  Learn how to make decisions for themselves.  Get to know and learn who you are and what you want to be.  

We need to trust God and move forward in your life.  Learning how to make decisions that are going to fit your lifestyle and make you happy.
