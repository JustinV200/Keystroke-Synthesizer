     In modern day society, money truly runs the world. The old expression "money makes the world go around" can be even more true now than ever.  Money can buy more than just material goods, it can buy experiences, friends, politics, anything really. With this in mind, a love of money is not materialistic so much as it is survivalist for many.
     One could say that modern society is materialistic, but humans as a species have always been that way. We, as humans, have started wars and created violence over the smallest things like land, food, livestock, etc. As humans we are also the dominant species on the planet, so it could be said that our materialism is what kept our species alive and thriving. Had we not have been materialistic over land, villages may never have been made. Modern day currency was created just over a hundred years ago. For most of species existence, we have used barter to acquire the goods and services we need. Modern money changed that, making it important and necessary to worry about money and finances. 
     In conclusion, one would not think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Modern society and ancient societies are very far off from each other and are very different from each other. You cannot compare two diiferent ways of life with one another. Modern society is trying it's best to get everything paid for with modern currency.
