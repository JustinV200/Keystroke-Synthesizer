     In my opinion, people are happiest if they follow through with the personal goals they have set for themselves. For example, when you are a child, you dream of what you will do when you grow up.  You think about how you will be great in the field you choose and you just know that you will live a great live with no worries.
    Then you are a teenager and you begin taking all the classes that you can so that you can  accomplish your goals.  Fast forward a few more years and you are in college. You study and take every class available to you so that you will be more knowledgeable in your career and graduate with the degree you need so that you will be able to finally work in the field that you chose so many years before as a child.  
     Finally, you are working as the doctor you always wanted to be.  You work every day helping mothers and babies live happy and healthy lives. Watching those mothers and children that you cared for in your years of working as a doctor, you finally achieve that happiness that you knew would come along with the dreams you had when you were a young child. 
    This is my belief of how to become a better human and to achieve the happiness that you dreamed of your entire life.  By working hard and making sacrifices to excel in your chosen field, you will eventually accomplish all that you want in life. In doing this for yourself, you will be able to help others, whether it is in your field of expertise or in your private life. 
     I can only hope that I have made an impact on the lives of those that I have helped throughout the years. I want my legacy to be one of joy and happiness that I helped others achieve.
