I feel that competition in the workplace can have way more positive benefits than cooperation. Competition forces you to go forward while cooperation makes for more quality in your progress. Cooperation sometimes only works if everybody has your best interests at heart. 
Competition keeps you going, and makes you want to do better than the next person. Let's say you and you co-worker are told about a job promotion, and the job promotion will be given to the one that has the best numbers on sales. This is going to become a competition to both, and this is going to make both strive to do their absolute best. 
Competition isn't always the healthiest for any of us, because it can make you just be all about competition and not take in others feelings. Although competition and being succesful can boost your self esteem. Having good self-esteem, can make you do much better at your job, having that postive mind set. 
Competition gives you something to look forward to, something to achieve a goal line. Having that alone can make someone succesful, and also be a success to the business overall. 
Healthy competition is going to be the best success, not getting too competitive with eachother and still thinking about you are in the workplace and must still keep your job in top priority. 
All in all I feel it is a win for the individual and the company as a whole. 
Accomplishing the goal either you win or lose is going to make you feel successful, no matter the end result.
