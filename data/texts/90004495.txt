I believe that in both work and society, more success is gained by cooperation than through competition. When people cooperate with each other, everyone is working for everyone's benefit. If there are no hard feelings, or feelings of jealously and competition between people, I believe that people will work harder and produce better results. For example, if you look at the Amish people, they are always working in cooperation with each other. Could you raise a barn by yourself, or while being in direct competition with your teammates? No! The only way to raise a barn is through cooperation.
A more modern example would be the factory assembly line. Can a product be made if every department is competing against each other? No! You need teamwork and cooperation in order to make things work.
People in modern society are so tied up in themselves, and being on top of everyone else, that they forget that without teamwork and cooperation. If our ancient anscestors had been competetive against each other, we wouldn't have modern society. Throughout history, tribal societies have existed for hundreds and thousands of years because they believe in community and cooperation. I believe that a society is simply not possible without a strong sense of cooperation and teamwork.
