Modern life may be characterized as materialistic. People are often procuring and using material items. The question that arises is should this activity be criticized?

Yes, this materialistic bent should be criticized for several reasons such as the environmental impact, the spiritual impact, and the social impact.

First consider the environmental impact. The manufacturing, distribution, consumption and disposal of material items has a negative impact on the environment. Factories and their pollution are needed for the manufacture of material items. Fuel is consumed to transport the items from the factory to the consumer. When the consumer uses the items waste is often created. Finally when the item is no longer useful it adds to the size of landfills.

Second consider the spiritual impact. Human beings are first and foremost spiritual beings. This spirit being transcends and is higher than the physical being. When great amounts of time and energy are spent on material possessions this spirtual self is neglected. This neglect is detrimental to the healthy functioning of the individual. A sense of peace is obtained only when focus is shifted away from material things and towards the spirit.

Third consider the social impact. People are social creatures and interactions among people are needed for healthy living. When the focus is on material items attention is taken away from interpersonal relationships. Envy and jealousy are often the result of this focus on material items. Joy is forfeited when material items are considered before relationships.

In conclusion, it is right to criticize materialistic behavior due to its negative impact on the environment, the spiritual life, and on social relationships. Our society would be better if there was less of an emphasis on material items.
