Competition versus cooperation in today's society plays a pivotal role whether it be a business venture, sports competition or just your daily routine at work with your peers and leadership.  Success is the key outcome of all these activities and that success can be measured and realized in numerous different ways.  Even if there are failures when competing or cooperating on a given task there are lessons to be learned and applied to future endeavors.
First I'd like to advocate the benefits of competition.  When individuals are pressed into competition I have found that both sides benefit.  In the work setting, new and innovative ideas are formed and come to fruition.  The imaginary juices of problem solving flow rapidly and although the solutions may be cost prohibitive or even technologically unreal, the competitive arena tends to provide solid metrics for future solutions to current issues.
Cooperation in the social and working environment has it's place, for we are indeed a civil society.  The issue I find with cooperation is that people tend to flow with whatever is normal or acceptable by the majority.  New ideas, problem solving and future visionary practices and business models still get merit but the crativity brought about through cooperation tends to be lacking when compared to competition as it relates to success.
In closing, we as a human race and individuals know how each of us like to solve our daily and future achievements.  Some of us are profoundly competitive at work and play while others want to cooperate in everything that they accomplish on a daily basis.  Competition and cooperation each have valued merits and pitfalls but in the end you have to be true to who you are as to how you achieve success on a daily basis in all your life's activities.  Good Luck!
