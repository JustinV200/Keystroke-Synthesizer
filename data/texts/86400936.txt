   In a tournament between competition and cooperation I would be willing to wage my bets on cooperation as the landslide winner. We are one society, one people, as long as one person among us loses, everyone loses. We have a choice, to bring one another up or to bring one another down.  My vote is on everyone coming up via cooperation.  While the very nature of competition brings some people down. 
   One may say that competitiion inspres one to do their best.  However, many diverse minds, skills, and experienses. pooled as one equals more than the sum of their parts. We do better together, we can bring greater benefit to one another and society through cooperation. 
   What's the end goal of everything we do? To selfishly make money? Money only has value when some people have more than others.  That's what the goal is in a competitive society. A cooperative system is conducive to the end result of success for everyone in a lasting meaningful way. 
   Cooperation would ultimately bring about a kinder, more successful teamwork that honors everyone and their unique conbritutions.
