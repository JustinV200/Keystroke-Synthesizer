I think that success can be achieved by both cooperation  and competition. Cooperation and competition can be equally important when striving for success at work or just in life. Competition at work among striving co-workers can be beneficial if it is done in a reasonable manner. Some co-workers love to push each other to do better at their positions. Cooperation is always needed when trying to accomplish something in life.

If there was not any cooperation at my job, things would not get done in an efficient manner.
Cooperation is needed from all employees at a company or corporation. Cooperation at entry level jobs is just as important as middle level and top tier positions. The lack of cooperation at a job can cause a company to lose money or have to go out of business. My position at my job requires my full coopeeration in order to get things done.

 Competition is not a requirement on my jobs. I think that friendly competition can be very beneficial for innovative employees and great thinkers. Competition helps bring out the best in my work performances. I have achieved great success at work from being pushed by other striving and innovative co-workers. I can honestly say that I would not be as successful  without the competition at my place of employment. Throughout my years of working, I have realized that cooperation is a must in life and that competition is a added bonus. I think that people achieve more success from cooperation than they do competition. Competition is mostly beneficial to the elite workforce members. I think that everyone can still benefit from having cooperation and competition in their lives.
