Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Materialism is something that many people feel diffrent about some people hate it but others tend to love it. There are good things that come with this, but often bad things come with it. Materialism has played an important role in our happiness within time, but it happens to take away a lot of peoples energy with consuming and producing more over time. People may criticize materialistic for the time it takes away from peoples life with the energy it takes up.  They try and make materialism okay by showing how you can consume and produce more with it, but over time with the lack of energy you have, you would be less motivated to produce more merchandise. With this information you can see how people should be criticized for including materialism in their lives. Without the action of materialism people would have more energy and have a less stressful life with more time on their hands; including time with friends, family, and pets. As I stated before modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Basically there is no way that modern society shouldnt be criticized in my very own opinion.
