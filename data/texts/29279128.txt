This essay is about happiness and gives my opinions on weather people are more likely to be happy if they focus on themselves and their goals or on the happiness of others.

I think it depends on the person and everybody is different but in general I think most people are happiest with a mix of both. For example a person who graduates college with a good degree in their field of interest. They will be very happy having focused on themselves and having achieved a degree. But they will also be happy having pleased their parents. I know some college students who were only doing it to please their parents, not themselves.

There is an old saying that say's something like most people are about as happy as they have made their minds up to be. Still happiness means many different things to different people. So do some people give to charities for example to help others in need or to feel good about themselves and be happy with themselves? Again I think it depends on the person. My mother in law likes to give because she wants to be recognized as a giving person not because she likes to give. It makes her feel good to be thought of as a giving person.

In conclusion I know that some people may have a solid opinion one way or the other and may disagree with my opinion that a balanced life of focusing on both yourself and others is the best way to happiness.Everybody is different so it is impossible to say what makes everyone happy one way or the other. Think of person that just won the lottery. They are very happy but then look at how many people ended up unhappy in the end having wasted much of it and given much of it away. There is an old song with lyrics something like make someone happy and you will be happy too. I think there is a lot of truth to that. Happiness is attained by having a mindset to be happy and having good balance of focus on yourself as well as others in my opinion.
