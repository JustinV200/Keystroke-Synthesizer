With this essay, it is going to address the issue of images and impressions and them possibly having too much of an effect on people. It is known that appearances can come off as being very important. Also, appearances can have people thinking one way or another. Images and impressions DO have too much of an effect on people: people see things and want them but might not be able to afford them, and also, people see each other, and people might think that what they see (with people) is everything/every aspect of people. However, that is not always the case.

With images and impressions, people can be shown advertisements for products. Those products can be made to seem very desirable. However, after a person buys a product, they might be left feeling as though what they spent their money on could have been spent on something else (or the money could have been saved). Yes, there are products that actually DO advertise great things, and when people get those products, they are happy with them. Even though that can be true with SOME products, many other products tend to fall short and do not reach or exceed people's expectations. There is also the issue of seeing people and how they act, in public, but when they are in private, they can be completely different people. Kids might see those people in public and think to themselves, "Hmm, I would love to be like them," not knowing how those people REALLY are behind closed doors.

What we see is not always what is true. Yes, there might be some reality with what is shown/seen with people and products. However, it is important for one to recognize that appearances are not always truths, and that one must really question what is shown/seen to decide whether something is real or not.
