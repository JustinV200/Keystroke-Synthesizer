A normal part of life is having to work hard to be able to make the money to be able to buy the resources that we need to survive. But some of the things that we work so hard for, are they really necessary for survival? A lot of people tend to be considered materialistic because they like to buy nice, expensive things to be happy. While others seem to be happy living on basic and low cost items.

The world is living in a time that is full of so many hardships. People should not be critized for being happy, no matter where they find it. Those who find happiness in having expensive things and spending money work for the money that they are spending. Those people deserve to enjoy their hard work and reap the benefits. Also, materialism is fairly objective. What might seem extravagant and unessecary to one person, but seem basic and needed to someone else.

It might be hard to see some people who live that way and not judge them for it. It can be so upsetting when other people who also work so hard just to make ends meet see other people who have nice things and seem to come by them so easily. It can also be hard to not think that the people who seem materialistic are setting poor examples for others, like their children, that they need nice things to be happy. But people should be able to find what makes themselves happy and enjoy that without redicule from others.

Does the whole population need expensive and fancy things to survive? No, they do not. Some people are happy living in a small van and traveling the world. Others would be happier with a large house with a swimming pool in the back yard. But with everything going on in the world, everyone should start trying to be happy for other people who are happy. Everyone should find something that brings them peace and joy into their lives.
