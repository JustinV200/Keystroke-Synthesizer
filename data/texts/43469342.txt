Ive always heard people say you have to fight for what you want in life, everthing is a competition to suceed. The older I became the more I realized this was true and it was also false. Yes, you absolutely have to fight for everything you want in life and yes that means having to to be the best of the best so competition is slim. What I have learned along the way though is it is okay to have competition but first you have to have cooperation.
 While many people just see it as survival of the fittest, I see it as a mutual effort. A partnership or collaboration is almost always necessary at some point in your lifetime to get to the acheivments you desire. I strongly and whole heartdly believe working with cooperation instead of competition gets you not only further in life but is much more likely to maintain a healthy work  enviroment with memorable accomplishments.
There is always a need to better your success and to better your family or just your life in general, but with that you have to have a drive point. What drives you to succeed? For me it would be my children. I would never want them so hungry for success that everything is a rivalry. Competition can be very healthy, only though when lead by cooperation. 
If you go through life making everything an intense contest you will have nobody on your team helping you accomplish your goals. It is better to be able to accomplish all of your goals with a team behind you than it is to have a negative lasting effect on those you may meet along the way.  You will always acheive more and gain more while working effectively through cooperation then you will being a top competitor.
