Acquiring new things always fills us with a sense of pleasure and happiness and in order to achieve that feeling over and over again we tend to buy more and more things we don't need. This hunger for acquiring new things is regarded as materialism. It is within our very being to be materialistic, otherwise we wouldn't be needing anwer this question right now.

To acquire things one needs money, and money is a limited resource that one has to work hard for and if someone is spending their own hard earned money forbuying uneccessary things, it would the same as if some one bought a car only throw it off a cliff for the fire produced from the blast. Be it may in our core sense as a being that we like to have new things though it never hurts to be a little responsible. One should be frugal about their money. People should help others to not spend money on uneccessary things. Rather than criticizing them we should help them. Modern inventions made it easier than ever to spend money on useless things. Now within a couple of clicks you can buy a new car. Self control needs to practiced if we really want to fix our "materialism" problem.

In the end all it falls down to is to be responsible of our own actions and help others be responsible through it.
