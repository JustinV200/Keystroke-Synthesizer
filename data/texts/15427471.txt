In the modern world today, images and impressions have a signficant effect on people. What we normally see on social media and news outlets are usually what people want us too see, not what it really is. We are almost blinded with how perfect everything seems on social media. 

For instance, certain entertainers, politicians and many public figures portray an image of themselves that is not based off of pure reality. Us users are only able to see what is posted in front of us but we don't have a deeper understanding of the actual truth. For instance, many public figures will show that they are wealthy on social media but in reality they are in debt and don't actually have millions of dollars of which they claim to have. Additonally, they might speak about certain things on the media without even actually believing in it just for the purpose of creating content and advancing their own platforms.

When it comes to advertisements on social media, content creators have famous figures post and talk about their products. Since viewers believe that these public figures approve of the product and enjoy the use, they automatically want to purchase it as well. The product can have absoultely no infromation about it but it doesnt matter to many people nowadays. Instead, they look at who used the product and what they have to say about it. The people who promote this items might even hate the product but they are getting paid to promote it so they will do their best to have their subscribers purchase it.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where we can't trust everything that we see. Pure images and impressions do have a significant effect on people and their decisions. Not everything is set out to be what it claims to be and we have to go back to trusting our own instincts and not listening to everyone on the media.
