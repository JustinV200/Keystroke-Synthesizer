      Meterialistic behavior is not a new thing in our world. In the past, many people lived a materialistic lifestyle. But there was a sense of belonging in the old days. In modern society, there is no sense of belonging to the materials we consume. It is the wrong way. Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.
      We consume lot of products. After the purchase, we don't feel a personal connection to that product. Access to products and wealth is high in modern city. This is also the reason for the materialistic approach. Even if they had enough money, people had to work hard to get a product they wanted to buy in the past. Buying things takes a long time and a huge investment. So they became atttached to that product. They used it for a long time. 
       In modern society, the time period of the product is very short. People ignore the product after the small problem with that product. They didn't try to repair the product. Buying a new one is an easy way to replace the old one. This behavior creates a lot of materiaistic wastes around the world. We have to stop this behavior. We have to live a minimalistic lifestyle.
