I believe that cooperation is a better way to achieve success over competition. With competition, you can create a hostile enviornment between workers who are fighing to become the top dog in the group. If the staff are constantly trying to compete for that top spot, the quality of the work becomes poor. This could lead to bad customer reviews and then cause sales to fall. It would crumble the company from the inside out. A company with poor moral will put out porr quality work.

Now cooperation can help to build a stronger company. With this technique everyone on the staff is required to work as a team. They can't leave the weakest link behind becuase in order to get ahead they all have to put in the work. This creates a more friendly enviornment for all team members, which in turn gives you better moral. A happy working team will be more productive than one that is constanly trying to win against each other. The more productive the team, the better the company will run from the inside out. You will have better sales and better customer reviews than say if you created a hostile enviornment. 

So in conclusion, a company that is based off of cooperation over competition will have a better out put of work and overall better moral.
