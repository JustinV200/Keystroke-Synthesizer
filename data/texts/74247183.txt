To answer the question yes images and impressions does have a significant effect on people. And now a days these effect no not very healthy. In current day there are so many issues when it comes to impressios. People lie a lot and get badly infulenced by these images and impressions. 
Lot of the issues stem with social media and reality shows that project the idea of luxry and perfect body image. Which has lot of issues in itself since most of them are fabricated and lies but people don't understand that. And try to recreate such life to themself and lose the life they have for themself in this process. 
Most of the celebrites and reality stars who create this beautiful image of a life for media and social media suffer from depression and other mental disorder themselves which we don't understand most of the time before the meet big tragedes. Most of the stars we obsess over have taken thier lifes due to the spot light. so overall in my point of view it is an unhealthy thing to go about this impression and image issue happening in the persent which not checked may cause bigger issues in the future.
