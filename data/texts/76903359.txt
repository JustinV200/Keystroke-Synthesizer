 Happiness is something able to be found based on the individuals personal goals. Most people believe they are able to find happiness through different steps as well. Such as not focusing on self happiness but being more focused on the happiness of others. 
 Truth about happiness is not everyone will be able to find such a wonderful feeling. When you have people who have made thier minds up about how they are able to find what happiness is they are unable to focus on any means for self improvement. Having a detached perspective can help them to be able to make the decision of what it is that will make them happy. By being less directive towards reaching only thier happiness they are possibly able to find it in the journey of helping others.
  Being complex with strategy for personal goals and the happiness of others a person is more likely to be able to find happiness along the way by doing them both. The happiness of others improves the way one can think and feel about themselves. Along with being satified about reaching for goals that seem to be the most imposssible. A person is more than likely to be happy just to see others happy when they are able to reach goals they have set for themselves as well. Happiness comes to everyone differently so either way could be a possible solution to help people to be able to achieve finding happiness.
