Nowdays people trying hard to find out ways to be happy in their life.They connect their happiness with something or some one and spent their lifetime in chasing happiness.some people relate the happiness with their own personsl goals like earning money,buying things,reaching a high level in career  etc they purely personal goals in life.some people relate happiness with way of making others happy they found their own happiness it may be social service or in personal.
For example a person who sacrifice their own needs for family members happines its personal making their loved ones happy throught that they find own happiness.another example is person who find their happiness in working of welfre of a society whole people like mothertheresa,abraham lincoln etc,social activst or a politician who works for welfare of huge people.way of finding hapiness is different from one to another because every individual had different perspective on life.not only human activist or there some people do work for animals and birds also.
 so in my point of view life goal is to be happy we have to choose the way which satisfies our mind ,so in order to make others happy we should be happy first,so we give equal or little much importance to our personal happiness than others happy we took balanced stand in these two things.according to me if u make loved ones it may human or others ,their happiness makes you happy.it is the universal truth in order to achieve it we may compromise in our personal things it is justified.
