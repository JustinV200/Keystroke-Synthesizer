I am very happy when the others are happy. a child enjoys taking things. they want to possess. you take childern to a toy shop and thats is. they would want to bring the whole toy shop home. they would like to grab everything. this is infant joy infant happiness. then there is a happiness that is more mature, and that is the happiness you get form giving. It is the happiness of your grandmother or grandfather. 


you will see there are many people around the world who always enjoy giving. they give because giving gives them more joy, it gives them more joy, it gives them unparalleled satisfaction. A succesful person is one who has tasted the joy in giving and continues to give and share. but both happiness and success depend on your ability to give. this ability to give is in your consciousness. it is not object that you give that matters, but the attitude of sharing.

one thing that can be really helpful in coming out of depression is developing an attitude of service. thinking what can I do for society or getting involved in bigger causes shift the focus of life.  so others happiness is more important than personal goal.
