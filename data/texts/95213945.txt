Competition is quite common in America. However, is competing really the best way to achieve success? No, competition is not the best way to achieve success! In order to be successful, we must cooperate with other people.

When there is rivalry at work (which some may call competition), someone always ends up losing. Some people may argue that competition does breed winners. Indeed, the people who claim this are correct. However, competition also breeds at least one looser. This means that although there are winners in competition, full success is not achieved as not everyone can be a winner. When we cooperate, there are no losers. Everyone that cooperates wins.

In sum, although competition is often viewed as the best way to achieve success in America, it truly is not. How can competition create success when it creates at least one loser? It cannot. However, cooperation does not make for a loser. It is the opposite of competition, and it is the way to achieve success. And, in America, we place great value upon achieving success. If, we as Americans want to achieve the greatest success possible, we must all work together to make that success that we crave so badly happen. We do that by cooperating!
