Happines is the state of mind and I think that the most people experience it differently. Some people love to make others happy and it makes them satisfied and happy, some people love to make plans, and following through them, makes them happy. Everyone is different. There is not one universal way how to become happy.
People who are happy usually have peace in their minds, they solved some big problems in their lives, they experience happiness when they see their families happy. People who were sick and their condition improved are also hopefull and happy. 
The purest form of happiness we can observe in children. Every little thing can cheer them up, they can enjoy completely simple things. We should take an example from them when we take life too seriously and everything seems dark and depressing to us. 
Sometimes it is very difficult to look at the world with happy eyes, especially when we are bothered by a big problem (eg. the death of a loved one, and incurable disease, failure at work...). Then it is best to find someone who would liten to us, who we can talk to, or seek professional help. We should not be ashamed to look for a help of psychologist. They are here to help us find peace of mind and guide us back to happiness. 
I do not think that there is a way to find out if people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others. I think, everyone has a little bit of both inside of them. When I feel happy about my achievements, I crave to give some of the happiness to others, and I love to start helping others. When I feel like I gave "too much", I feel tired and used up, I love to go back to myself and concentrate on my personal goals again. Everyone has to find their balance of happiness for themselves.
