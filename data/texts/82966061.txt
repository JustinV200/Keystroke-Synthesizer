The question being asked is if people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition.  I would like to say I believe success is higher achieved through competition whether it be friendly or more of a rivalry.  By either way, I think it is achieved more than through cooperation.  Let me explain why I have this opinion.

I believe cooperation doesn't allow for much room in thinking outside of the box.  Cooperation isn't something for the person who may have a bigger imagination.  I think we can see  many highly succeessful people thought outside of the box and wanted to get ahead of the game.  I believe these people liked or thrived on competition with rivals.  Healthy competition keeps people on their toes.  It makes them strive to be better.  It makes them try harder. I think cooperation holds us back from trying more.  Cooperation seems to me as a way to just get by or do as much as the next person, but never doing more.  I also believe people who cooperate in competition will only go so far.  Wanting to win and succeed takes rivalry and drive.  I believe people work harder to achieve goals when there is someone there trying to beat them at their own game.  

In conclusion, if I had to choose which one I would prefer in such an environment, I would always have to pick competion.   I think it proves to be more successful in the long run.  I believe cooperation is too laid back and relaxed.  There is something to be said with a good fight to win and succeed.  I also believe that if competing and still not doing as well as your rival, you still are doing more than if you were cooperating.  Cooperation is boring.  Competition is invigorating, fun, spontanious, active, driving, exhilerating and all around satisfying.
