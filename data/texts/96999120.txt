There are many types of happiness. Since weveryone person is different and has a different mindset, their version of hapiness is unique. Having one self's happiness is measured by their mind. Each mind has a goal that will peak their happiness. Focusing on their personal goal of happiness is the aim. The happiness of othres are too different to be the same personal goal of an individual.
One happiness can only be measured by that one person. Others cannot determine the one's happiness through their happiness. There is really no definite happiness that can match the one. If they can focus on their personal goals, they will be happy since iots their known goal. The happiness of others are too many to determine and cannot apply to self happiness. For example, in the novel Ethan Frome, the main character Ethan chose personal happiness even if it meanrt suicide and betrayal of his wife. He chose to die with young lover becuase the he could not agree on the happiness of his wife. He went through extreme means to end his life. It ultimately fails and he ends up unhappy for the rest of his life. 
One may think, apealing to other happiness can be their personal happiness. That would mean that one person has no self personal goals of happiness. You can say that a personal goal of happiness is the happiness of others. Therefore meaning their self happiness is dependant on others which is acceptable since there are many types of personal goals. 
Overall, there are several types of personal goals that specifically make people happy. The happiness of others will not make one more happy unless their personal goal has others considered.
