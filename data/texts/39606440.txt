The modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic! As the modern technology advances, so do humans' minds. We work hard every day trying to get food on the tables for the whole family. Since we work hard, we get tired and burned out as well.  Therefore, we need something enjoyful for us to relax after the hard working days.

What is "something enjoyful" for us? The answer depends on whom you ask. Some people focus on consumption of delicious food but others concentrate on other activities such as traveling or sports. Consuming more or engaging in more activitie means we're getting more materialistic. It's certain that we can survve without those additional food or activities, but at same time, we cannot get ourselves relaxed and ready for the coming days. Therefore, being materialistic is a natural trend that we cannot avoid.

On the other hand, if we consume way too much resources in a short period of time, probably the resources on the Earth will run out much sooner than we expect. Therefore, how to balance between consumption and conservation is a very important topic. I think we can be materialistic and focus on the conservation concept at the same time without sacrifying our enjoying lives. What do you think?
