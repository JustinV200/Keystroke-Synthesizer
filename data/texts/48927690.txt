Materialism is widely accepted as a selfish and undesirable trait for a person to posess- hardly anyone would argue against this belief. We've all grown up listening to stories that feature materialistic villains who stand in contrast to selfless, humble protagonists. A materialistic person would be assumed by most people to be vapid, inconsiderate, ignorant and more. Is this really a fair sentiment, though? 
As human beings, we can't help but crave certain comforts. According to Maslow's heirarchy of needs, various categories of needs play an important role in a human's behavior. These needs include idealistic things such as love, respect and self-esteem but at the bottom of the heirarchy are the basic physiological needs. People require food, shelter, clothing, toiletries and more to function properly. It stands to reason that indulging in a bit of materialism would benefit a person's mental health and have a positive impact on their daily behavior. 
When you think about it, materialism itself isn't inherently negative. We tend to react negatively to materialism because of the consequences caused by it. Materialism is fueled by utlization of resources, which tends to be done in an unfair and unsustainable manner. Theoretically, if a person could find a more sustainable and measured source for their materialistic indulgences, they wouldn't really be doing anything objectionable. It might be better for people to readjust their thinking and stop denegrating humans who are just trying to make themselves feel happier and more content. Instead, that energy could be put towards developing better practices for producing goods to feed materialism.
