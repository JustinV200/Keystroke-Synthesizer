I think that, yes images do defintely have an impression on people and and it is a harm to our society. There is decptive advertising, especially with any symbolism around weight loss and how people perceive that to be 'body positive'. Since the evolution of social media and Youtube, it is even more so, and drilling into younger people's minds, making them think that they are not 'good enough' or comparing to others, wanting to be that better person. 

Of course celebreities and politicians want to look good and be shown in a positive image, because it is good for their reputation. Everyone strives for fame and wanting to be known, but in reality, is that a good thing? Before the internet and social media plaforms starting controlling the narrative, I think it was a judgment free zone. Nnow people just talk behind others back or post negative comments or unflattering pictures of them on social media. 

To get over this issue, we need to take a step back and really think about the situation before saying that the other 'better person' has it all. We need to be more down to earth and put our faith in god, go to church and realize what is here for the greater good. It we focus too much on what others think of us of how will we ultimately be independent?
