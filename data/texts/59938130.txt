      Did you know some of the poorest countries in the world are home to the happiest people? How is this possible? Somehow these people are able to find something in their lives that brings them true happiness. The question is, is this the personal goals of them or the happiness of others that shines a light into their lives? In my opinion, happiness comes from your own personal goals. Everyones happiness is different and unique, and its up to the individual to discover that for themselves. 

    How is this possible? It is done with a concsious effort. What most people dont realize is that emotions come in different strengths. Happiness takes effort to achive. This effort comes through cognitive strides every day towards long term goals. It is said that achievement of long term goals brings some of the greatest happiness in life. Yes, you can find happiness through the comfort of a relationship, but often unhappiness will follow if the individual is not happy on a personal level.

In conclusion happiness is a deeply powerful emotion that is difficult to achieve. In my opinion, this level of happiness is achieved through accomplishments of personal goals. This can be both long and short term goals. This can be something like making a spot on a sports team or recieving a raise at work. The point is it is unique to the individual. By finding our personal interestings we can all aim to achieve that level of happiness.
