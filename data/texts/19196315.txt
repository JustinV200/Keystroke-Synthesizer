It is the objective of most functional human beings to pursue a life which is both enjoyable and meaningful and leads to some degree of happiness. I firmly believe that our upbringing as children is an important factor in this journey. We may be self directed but our motivation is likely to be instilled by following the example of people we repect and trust. 

Therefore our lives should not only follow a direction that makes us happy , but also sets an example for those with whom we contact and in some way create a path for them. This theory has its merits in researching and understanding the progeny of successsful and seemingly happy adults. In other words, success and happiness should beget successs and happiness. Whether in business, education, medicine, sports or any other endeavor, it is not unusual to see a direct linkage of parent to children.

Of course this is not set in stone. There are many fulfilled and successful people whom have had no parental nourishment and have chosen a path diametriacally opposite to those who influenced them. Despite that contrary path, they too have the same objective - to be happy.
However subconsciously their motivation was likely a part of their formative years. Remember I am referring to MOST functional beings.

In conclusion, look to the youth. If instilled with a degree of decency, moral values , and a sense of self governing , their happiness will be a pleasant and fulfilling journey.
