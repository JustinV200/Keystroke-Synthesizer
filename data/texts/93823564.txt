In the world there are lot of impressive people in the media field. Naturally every normal person attracted by the popular person they are may be a politician, media person, actor, actress.  The impression on the media and political person is everyone single person nature. No one can except for that rule. That atraction is make some effect on people it may be financially or life style changes. In my view everyone atracted by the media people on their life.

Every single person have some favorite media person like some actress or actors or any other field in the media. It is natural one for everyone. most of the media persons acted in the advertisement it can make some effect on the people. It is a bussinuss statergy. The images on the politician is very much affect on everyone life it can effectively make their life style changes according to their mindset. In my point of view on the question is yes images and impressions have make some effect on the people. In deeply says, i personal feel that i am also have some impression by one actor and i bought some things even it is not neccessory.

There are  a lot of impressive people we are seeing our daily day to day life. We are considering the social media population even more people are impressed their talent. Know the world is open for everyone to became a impressive person on the media field using the social media. So my final point is images and impressions have too much of an affect on people.
