In todays society results come about through different channels, some more successful than others. Some believe that a competitive spirit brings the best results, while others would argue that cooperation is the answer. I feel that they both work in the end, but with cooperation winning my vote for more success. Success tends to be bigger when you have more people involved.
I have tried both competition and cooperation throughout the years and have some to thge conclusion that cooperation has produced more success. I tried to overcome and obstacle and found that when more people cooperated to help overcome the obstacle I saw a better success. This is because you have more focused energy into what you are trying to do. The more positive engery through cooperation the better.
On the other hand some people would argue that competition is the ultimate way to go and cooperation takes to long to produce results. This is not true. Think of putting everything into 1 thing and that thing fails. What people would be left with is failure and zero success. When cooperation is used you have more of a chance to succeed instead of a single point of failure. Cooperation seems to always work best especially if you have a good group.
In conclusion I would like to say that throughout my life when a group of indiviuals cooperated success was imminant. When groups cooperate for the greater good success comes, and then spectacular results. Try it and see.
