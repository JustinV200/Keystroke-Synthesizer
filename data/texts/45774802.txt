Happiness is an idea more than a state of mind. Often we hear people say happiness come from inside. But in this day and age we all are depressed even though there is lot to percive and lot more people to connect it is because we really don't understand what we want. We run in a maze society created for us without an exit we are exhusted most of the time we are not offered help. If we don't know what we want we cannot pursue it.

Most of the people in this generation can not even understand that this is the problem. If we cannot understand what is bothering us we cannot fix it. Everones over all goal in life is to be happy and the idea of happiness differ form generation to generation.

Take the 70's the idea of happiness for most countries is to get their freedom. During Wars and gloabal crises ending that will the happiness. Even in personal life for an baby having to feed will bring the happiness but for a CEO earning billions will not bring happiness.

Focusing on other peoples happiness may sound noble but now a days people are selfish and greedy. If we try to help a person achive their goal they take us for granted and possible call the one helping a fool. I'm not saying that all people are like that due to internet and bad idealogy spreading among kids and young adults think riping off someone is a skill. So no one should base their happiness on making someone else happy. It will not be really helpful for both the giver and the reciver.

No one can hope for happiness one can do his/her best in life and wish that it makes us and other happy. World is a weird and messed up place providing for themselves should be ablove all. Finding happiness in their own way is better that making someone sacrifice their dream and hope that they have for their life.
