There are many factors that push peeople toward success. For some it may be the thrill of seeing oneself grow, and for others it may simply be to prove that they are better than others. While it is often thought that rivalry among peers is what pushes us to perform better, it is in fact cooperation that leads to the most growth. 

When we seek to outdo others, the goal often becomes less about our growth, and more about simply proving that we are better. Someone may purchase a car that is more expensive than their neighbor's only because they want to show that they are more successful, and not necessarilly because it is the car they truly want. Similarly, a work rivalry may result in someone being less effective at their own job, because they are more focused on outdoing whatever their rival is working on. Furthermore, success is not just a measure of performance and growing skills, but completing tasks and overcoming obstacles. The best way to accomplish difficult things is to work together with someone, so in the case of working toward achievements, it is the best idea to work together with another person. 

Some may argue that rivalry is a better approach, and that without someone to compete against, people have no reason to grow. The truth is that people do not need to work against each other to grow, but instead can work together against the problem. Two people working together to solve a single issue will find much more success than two people working seperately with the goal of being better than each other, instead of being better than the problem. 

In conclusion, while skills can indeed be grown out of rivalry, success is found in working together to overcome obstacles.
