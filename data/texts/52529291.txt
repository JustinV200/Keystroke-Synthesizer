Images and impressions have far too much of an effect on people this day-in-age. We are living in a material world and the way that people perceive the world and the things in it are oftentimes swayed their materialism. It's human nature to be drawn to the person or thing you find most attractive. 
The manner in which people determine attractiveness is somewhat unique to the individual; however, there is typically an overhwleming consenesus on what is considered attractive overall. The main driver behind this is the media and how they create these "fantasy" ideals. Media promotes the most beautiful and luxurious of people and so people who consume the media are influenced greatly especially if they have done so since a young age. People start to get this unrealistic grip on reality and can be quite disappointed when they realize it. 
While people are undeniably drawn to the most attractive option, I think only people who have a true open mind are able to see things for what they truly are. A groom may have the most beautiful bride but if she hurts others, it deflects from the positive image and can actually impact others views of her beauty negatively. Ultimately, beauty as they say "is skin deep" and while it can take some people a lot longer to reveal their ugly side, I would hope the majority of people eventually learn what truly matters in life. Beauty fades.
Beauty should be an all encompassing trait and only then should people prefer the most beautiful option. Beauty is a feature of another that is learned over time because at first glance a person can easily be deceiving. Beauty is not surface level, and most people learn that in due time.
