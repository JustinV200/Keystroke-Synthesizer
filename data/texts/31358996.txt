In our current socitey we have been taught to value materialism in order to be happy. For some people they equate their value to what they own and can feel they are better or less than others. In the United States we have a live to work concept but in some  other countries they believe in working to live. Our modern society should be criticized for being materalistic and learn to value simple things to be happy such as being in the moment and being present. We consume way more than we need, if we consumed less it would help the environment.

Even at a young age children start to look at material things as a symbol of status and worth. They can compare themselves to other children they have better clothes and toys or get what whenever they ask. Teenagers look at their favorite celebrities and  entertainers admiring their lifestyle and wealth.

As adults we compare and compete with each other and can become jealous if someone has more than us. What we fail to realize is what the other person has gone through and given up to get to where they are. We don't think about the effect it has had on their relationships and health. People that have more money and material possesions can have a hard time with finding genuine relationships and feel lonley. They don't know if their family and friends are around them for what they can provide and a status boost or if they truly care for them. 

In conclusion sometimes less is really more. When you have less you are happier because you have less stress and responsiblity. This leaves more time to foster connections and relationships. The quality of your relationships impacts your health and happiness. When people are older and at the end of their lives they don't wish they had more material possesions but wish they spend more time with the people they care about and did the things that they loved.
