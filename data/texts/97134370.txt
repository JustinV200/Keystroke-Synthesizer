The world has seen many great success stories throughout its history. Many of mankind's great acheivements have been completed by people working together to acheive a new milestone. At the same time, when others get wind of the attempt that is being made, they sometimes start to think that they could also attempt that task, and maybe even do it better than the ones who originally began it. It is one thing to attempt a task, but it is yet another to compete to be the winner or the first to complete the task. It is often proven that greatere successes have come about when there is a competetive nature to the task.

There are many businesses throughout American history which have benefitted from the spirit of competition. The automotive industry has had many improvements in its products based on car companies trying to build the most desireable and safest vehicles. The soft drink industry is another one that has had many variations and many interesting flavors and bottling designs as a result of companies competing to out-do each other.

Some people would claim that with a cooperative spirit even greater things could be accomplished. However, there is nothing more motivating than trying to beat your competitor. I would say that most people are more driven to work late nights and long hours to get ahead of their competitor, even if that competitor doesn't know there is a competition. 

If you want to acheive great success, you must have great motivation. The spirit of competition is a great motivator. Everyone wants to win, and when the stakes are high, the additional motivation of trying to beat your competitor is a great driver toward success.
