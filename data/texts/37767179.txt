Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? That's an interesting question, right? In this day and age, I don't see how anyone could could say no to that question. Social media is everything these days, isnt it? Social media is causing every teen to strive for the impossible. In a world of filters, smoke and mirrors, is anything even real anymore? We see it all too often, litte Mary Jane, scrolling through Instagram, wanting to be JUST LIKE the models she sees. The perfect airbrushed skin, the tiny waist line, all the designer things. It's sad to see so many young girls striving for this level of perfection, that simply just does not exist! It's all filters, angles, the right lighting.. none of it is real! I think it is very destructive and is teaching our children that what's important is what you look like on the outside, and how many pairs of Prada shoes you can collect, when they should should be focusing on being kind and a good person. Appearances really are mistaken for reality. I just think it's very sad that now a days people are more focused on creating this perfect image for everyone, than trying to help the world or show anything of any substance.  So in conclusion, I believe images and impressions absolutely have too much of a negative effect on people.
