Overall more success can be achieved through cooperation than with constant competition. However both are necessary and the real challenge is finding balance. Competition has many possible negative outcomes such as causing hurt feelings, spurring unchecked strife, and lost opportunities to support each other. But pushing for collaboration only can also be toxic if it means not allowing individual efforts or diminishing the drive felt when in a constructive competition.

Perhaps the problem is not one of balance but naming. Cooperation and competition can form a Venn diagram so what is in the middle? Cooperating with some level of explicit competitiveness which is explored purposefully, with intentional competitive events, or opportunities to chart/announce/honor achievements as victories for individuals/teams which better the whole?

Fiercely competitive can apply to entire industries or within a firm. The bigger picture is worth considering. Competition leads to innovation and to lower prices ideally. But collaboration is necessary to protect worker rights and establish fair practices or ways of doing what is right for people/the environment. Internally the same is true that businesses or offices or workplaces focused on competition as part of the culture can make big gains or profits or do something big. But at what cost?

Again, the key is balance. Thus the greatest challenge is determining what is in the middle. Each of us has a different perspective on the issues (including this one) and on where we stand. And if we examine our stance in relation to others then we certainly would benefit most from cooperative conversations rather than competitive arguments.
