I believe that people are more likely to find happiness if they focus on their own personal goals. I believe you can only make other people happy when you are happy first. How can you not be happy when your doing the things that you love and want to do? How can that happiness not rub off on everyone you?

If I'm not happy in my life I tend to make the people around me miserable as well.  When I'm not happy I tend to be cranky and irritable. When I'm aiming at my own personal goals and succeeding I will be happier. I will enjoy what I am doing in my life and therefore make my self happier.  For example, if I didn't spend a little time out of my day to go for a walk, which makes me happy, I'm a cranky and depressed person.  Sometimes for me that will even turn into physical illness. When that happens there is no way for me to make myself happy or anyone around me.  In fact, I can't do much of anything at all.

I do understand that for some people they believe that focusing their happiness on others will make them happy too. I believe that can be true, but your constantly searching for other people to please and that can be exhausting. Which may eventually wear you down and make you unhappy. I think its probably a limited time happiness and not an all the time happiness, which really isn't happiness at all.

So what I am saying is look for happiness inside your self and by pleasing yourself.  Not only will it make you happy but it will help you to make others around you happy too.
