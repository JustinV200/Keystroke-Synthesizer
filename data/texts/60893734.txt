The reality of how things are is something that I feel gets often overlooked in favor of outward apperances. These day, it seems that nothing how it originally appears. I'm sure you noticed it, a wonderous product wrapped in pretty packaging, but once you open it up, it's not all that much diffrent from the cheat no-nonsense bargin item. And even more so, I'm sure you noticed the culture of "impressions", where being reliability has become second to sociabity. We are in a culture of apperances, a soceity of eye candy, and even odder still, almost everyone is aware of this.

Maybe this sound familiar. After a long day t work, you catch up with your faviorite social media influencer. And their living the perfect life, glamourous lifestyle, beautiful spouse, they're always happy, everything that you want. But don't you find it odd, it's always some course, some secret that they stumbled onto that they want to sell you so you can live the life right alongside them. It sounds wonderful, but it's never that simple. Or is it? My belief is they are revealing the secret to their success, right in front of your nose. They are marketing the apperence of what their life appears to be, to you, so they can make the money to pursur their lifestlye. Sponsers to take advantage of the traffic they are generating. They are creating and monitizing a fanasty.

Creating and monitizing a fanasty is not anything new, but with the rise of social media, it has just been applied to its highest level. In reality, this is done at all stages . Have you ever heard of
