     Aesthethics, appearance, appeal, and presentation are all characteristics that people desire when they make a decision in life. The average middle-class, working person will make a purchase or pick up a trend such as what food to eat or what exercise to do depending on which celebrity is endorsing it on their social media outlets. Society is heavily influenced by others with fame and authority. 
     Present-day consumerism is dictated by who has the most followers on social media and who can be the next influencer. Women's fashion, for example, is overrun by everyday influencers who have followed the footsteps of celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Many female Americans are motivated to follow the trend of who can become the next film star, content creator, or model all by how much they can imitate the lifestyle and appearance of major celebrities. These impressionable females are hoping by looking the part of someone who has achieved such "beauty" and success that they can attain similar results themselves. 
     Seeing is believing more than ever with the existence and exposure of social media and marketing. People are drawn to what looks desireable, which has always been hard-wired into every human's biological make-up. Everyone will always make most decisions based on how good it will make them look and feel.
