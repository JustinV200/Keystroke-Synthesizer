Happiness is a topic that is much debate on how it can be acheived. While there are those that swear by goal oriented mind sets, otheres are convinced the only true way to happiness is through their own giving. It is important to examine the traits of both before deciding which will bring you true joy. 

Those that are goal oriented will always be reaching for the next thing. While this can seem fraught with trouble at first, it cuts down on all that idle time and boredom which often lead to discontent. Not only will the goals give the person something to focus their energy on but also they will give the person some joy as they accomplish each task they have laid out for themselves. Goals as a means to happiness is a practical way to measure what you are doing with your life and the satisafaction from it. 

Those who choose to go with the more giving route find themselves searching for ways to constantly give back to the world around them. There is no shortage of people in need so they will always have a way to strive for that joy. The hazard of this is the fact they will burn out quickly if they are not careful. On the other hand there is nothing like seeing the impact you have made on a life.                                         

To me the best way to accomplish true happiness is to combine the two. You need to set the goals of helping those around you. If you make them realistic, you are not going to burn out and when you see the changes made in a life, there is no other feeling like that. You can't just focus on one of these was a way to acheive happiness in your life. The downsides of each of them individually will always outweigh any benefit that could be achieved from them.
