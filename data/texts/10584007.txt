We have all seen ads because they are everywhere.  You can't watch TV, listen to the radio, or drive by a billboard with out seeing an ad.  What kinds of effects does seeing an ad have on the average person? I often see ads and wonder if the products in them are as good as they seem or if it's just a pretty wrapping with no substance.

I believe that ads do serve a purpose.  Sometimes you don't know about a new product or an upcoming event until you hear or see an ad.  I have found that ads are the best place to learn about sales and upcoming promotional events.  Imagine you were talking to a friend that just got back from your favorite store and saved 30% on their purchase because they saw an ad on TV.  You would feel really let down if you missed out on the sale.  Well your friend found out about the sale because they saw an ad and they took advanage of the sale.  What about the ads on TV that only show perfect people using the items?  Those ads want to lure you in with the ideal image of what you could look like using the product.  While this can sometimes be misleading, you are still seeing the product and the benefits of the product in the ad.

While not all ads are perfect, they all have something to say.  You can choose to see the ad as prostive or negative.  I choose to see the ad from a positive perspective.  Ad companies are just trying to get your attention and many times it works.  I have purchased products before from ads that I've seen.  If the ads are doing their jobs correctly, they will leave an impression and an effect on people.
