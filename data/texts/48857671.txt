Modern socitety should be criticized for being materialistic because materialism creates generations of people who do not value nature, creating more and more pollution and more and more people who don't have a conscience. Furthermore, it teaches children that you are only worth the material things that you have or can afford. So they are taught to place value on material things over their lives and the lives of others. This causes more and more violence as those who cannot afford the finer things in life are prone to take it by any means neccessary. A dog eat dog world. 

Materialism, doesn't teach the younger generation to be grateful for the things that they have, such as family, friends and a home, nor does it teach them the value  of nature or how to be intune with it. This causes more and more pollution and the destruction of nature, and violence towards one another, putting all of our lives in danger.

Materialism creates sweatshops and the mistreatment or slavery of people all over the world as it creates more and more greed. The greed that materialism creates also creates the overproduction of everything including cars. There are more cars than people can buy or afford sitting in war houses, yet we keep producing more and more vehicles adding to the pollution. Furthermore, manufactures keep coming out with a new version of the same phone ever few months and the age of the children owning these phones are becoming younger and younger endangering their lives as this leads to young children socializing with strangers on line. So materialism have many major flaws.
