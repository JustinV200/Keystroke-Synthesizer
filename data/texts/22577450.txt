One should ask what is happiness? Is it found in ones self or in the presence of others? Given that people need to be able to take care of themselves before they can take care of others, I am taking the postion that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals rather than on other people's happiness. 

First off, depending on others for being able to be happy can be disasterous. What if those people disappear one day? What would be you source of happiness then? Persnonal goals however rarely disapear and are always there unless they are time based.  Also personal goals are something that can be achieved unlike something that moves up and down like the happiness of others. Personal goals can also be something that directly or indirectly benefits humanity depending on what one does with ones life. If one works in restoring wetlands than the amount of flooding that humans experiance nearby can be reduced.

That is not to say that being happy about the happiness of others is a bad thing one might even say it is a good thing. However, happiness in others is not something that can be controlled, so depending on it as a means of happiness for yourself is a rather difficult thing to do. You can however controll your own happiness to a degree espicially if you are getting something concrete done like completing personal goals. Also, think about it how can you be happy if you spend all your time on others and not yourself?

Happiness is something every human seeks to have for at least some part of their lives. Achieving happines is a different matter. Just like it is easier to change oneself than another person, it is easier to achieve personal happiness through completed goals rather than happiness created through other people's happiness.
