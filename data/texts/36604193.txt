Images and impressions play a vital role not only in advertisements or public meetings, it also plays a part for a common man when he appear for an interview, or when a person expresses his ability or talent in a competition. At first we can see about the impression made by a product through advertisement. 
When a company introduces a new product to the world, it focuses more on the ways by which the product can reach more customers. Here we can take an example of toothpaste as a product advertised. Many companies make toothpastes, but when a new company tries to introduce their toothpaste and want to succeed among the existing one, they not only explain the advantages of their product, but also they create an attractive advertisement to express their product. When the advertisement is catchy, people will atleast think to try the product once instead of thinking about the benefits or disadvantages of the product. Most of the product needs to create a good impression among public to sell. 
Incase of politicians, entertainers, they make themselves to appear frequently in television so that people would not forget their face. Mainly politicians approach this type of publicity because they are very cautious about their presence for next election. When politicians make any debate on opposition, he will create a strong presence or impression on people's mind by which his wrong doings will be forgotten by people sometimes.
Finally, from marketing the products till politicians, impressions make an effect on people which can even change the bad opinion into a good one.
