Happiness can come in many ways to people. Happiness can also have different meanings and interpretations for many people. The definition of happiness is defined in so many ways that the true meaning would be dependent upon the individual and what they define as true happiness.

Some people feel happiness by seeking out goals in life and reaching those goals. Although, some may set goals that they will never reach regardless of how hard they strive to reach them.  At times some individuals may never find true happiness and continue in life attempting to find it but never reaching those unobtainable goals. At times this could be sabotoging their own happiness.

There are people that find true happiness by helping others and bringing happiness into other peoples lives. This is a selfless happiness that can continue throughout life. Simple acts can be the most important factor of gaining happiness within one's self.  Would this be pure gratification and happiness for someone that finds happiness in helping others to make them happy, or are they constantly struggling to go without their own happiness just to bring happiness to others. 

Happiness can be a pure, simple and satisfying emotion for people that experience it in their lives. Unfortunately, happiness may be a negative feeling when there is no gratification for the giver or receiver of this emotion. 

True happiness must be described individually and a person must be honest while expressing what brings them happiness. Some can reach every goal they set for themselves and never find happiness. Others can be so extremely happy while bringing happiness to others but their feeling of happiness could very well be superficial and they never find happiness within themselves. If an individual can clearly define happiness and what they do to find it is a wonderful thing.
