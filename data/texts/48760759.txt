There are plenty of arguments supporting the idea that to cooperate is better than to compete or the other way around. Dozens of articles promote cooperation or competition as the better approach, if one strives for success. However, in my opinion, people can achieve more success by a mixed approach, depending on the circumstances.
People unable to cooperate with others are bound to fail at some point. The same goes for people unable to compete with others and work towards a goal on their own. In order to be successful, a person needs to be adaptive, above all else. Some situations call for cooperation, while other environments are extremely competitive and you need to be competitive in order to survive. In my opinion it is not right to pick exclusively cooperation over competition or the other way around, because there is value in both. Some of the most successful people in human history are both extremely competitive, but also cooperative. Personally, in my work, I have found that different situations ask for different approaches. 
If a person wants to succeed, they need to be able to assess the situation and determine whether a cooperative or a competitive approach would be more suitable. Sometimes, one needs a little bit of both in order to successfully navigate work and life. That being said, some people are more competitive or more cooperative, in which case they can achieve the most success by utilizing their strenghts.
