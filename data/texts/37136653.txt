I am a Christian and try to carry my Christian values everywhere and put them into everything I do.  At home or in the workplace.  In the bible it is said.  A house divided will fall.  This is true in any situation that you are working with other people.    

It is so much easier to work together  in cooperation with each other on projects and get along with everyone to get the job done.  Not only will it get done faster but you might actually enjoy what you are doing and you might learn a thing or two from whomever you are working with.  When you are working with others in cooperation things get done at a much faster rate than doing it alone and for the most part.  Alone is boring.   
 
When in competition with each other the ugliness of people tends to come out.  I would rather work with you than against you.  When we work in competition, I am learning nothing, except getting the job done faster and better than you.  No new ideas.  No new input.  All one cares about is being faster and better than the other guy.  That sounds very stressful to me.  

All of this being said.  I would much rather work together and not compete with each other.  The work is done faster and probably better than if I had just rushed through it to compete and complete my work.  I may even make a new friend or two while I am at it, by working together.  I believe there is more value in most situations working together than competeing against each other.
