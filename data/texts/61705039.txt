   In todays society almost everything has become instant. Because of technology the world is now at our fingertips. Far too often people take what they see at face value and move on to something else.
   It is my belief that what you see is not always as it seems. People must be more aware and really want to know the truth. I think that part of this problem is because people don't think for themselves anymore. They allow the media, the internet or celebrities to tell them how to think.
   Take for instance how advertisments have changed in recent years. It used to be you knew just about every detail about what you were buying and now it's like here it is, isn't it pretty?I will use a personal experience as an example. I was recently looking for a new car. I went to several car lots and had the same experience at each one. The price was on the vehicles but no details. It was like pulling teeth to get the salesman to offer up any information. He was more like look how clean it is. A lot of images and impressions that are seen today are taken as being normal. People are lead to believe that what they are seeing is what everybody is doing, and that it is acceptable behavior. Most everything is manipulated to the benefit of those who are putting it out. 
   Some people would argue that for years we have been shielded or lied to and now the truth is coming out. They encourage the acceptance of what is shown. 
   If people do not wake up from this farce then we are doomed. This shows how easily people can be manipulated. Knowledge is the real power and that is what those who are in charge are afraid of. They don't want us to know the truth. So they paint the picture that they want us to believe. We are an educated society. Now is the time to prove it.
