Image is everything. That's what we are left to believe. With every corner of the world we live in turning our attention back center to what it is we are without, it's no wonder the cost of living becomes the biggest stress in our life. Even the term "less is more" requires a significant upfront investment in many cases. Take the popular van-life for example. Many claim the end result of their endevour to connect more with nature, to travel, or to take back any lost time to the typical 40 hour plus work week. But to do this, the amount of money and possession that goes intoit, whilst retaining all the typical luxuries we would otherwise leave behind, feels nothing like connecting to anything other than another hotspot once you're docked at the next campsite.

It feels almost impossible in today's society to connect to anything in nature or on the spiritual spectrum, without having to go through the digital realm first. Not just in the example given, but also in the day to day most humans face. On the other hand, not all forms of materialism is bad for the soul. People jjust need to find a balance on what it is that is most important in their life, and keep their possessions in line with their goals. Even building a one hundred thousand dollar van to live out of accomplishes this.

All in all, no matter where we go, the looming threat of buying an item to fill in the space missing from whatever inevitable insecurity we may have, does exist. We can manage it by just doing what it is we love and to give in less to the appeal of others. We find happiness with ourselves first. No item or thing can replace that.
