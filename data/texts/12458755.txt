         Competition and cooperation are a part of human nature and often coexist in our day-to-day activities, be it in the workplace, while playing sports or even interacting with family. Although both have their merits, it is through cooperation that we can achieve the most success.
         By cooperating, we are displaying openness to the opinions and strategies of others. Cooperation is somewhat synonomous with collaboration- working together to achieve a greater goal. It is inherently a group-oriented activity. By cooperating, we can leverage the strengths of others and those strengths can serve to supplement areas where me may be individually lacking. 
         Cooperation also fosters feelings of camaraderie in a group. When a group achieves a goal together, it feels good and can even feel magical. There's a reason why the phrase "well-oiled machine" exists- nothing can beat the feeling of synergy in the air surrounding a group that works well together. This synergy boosts each individual's confidence, and leaves them invigorated and eager to tackle the next challenge.
        Some may argue that a little "healthy" competition is good because it motivates us to succeed in our individual pursuits. While I don't disagree, I think there is a precarious line between healthy competition and toxicity. Competition leads to a win/lose mindset. It focuses on self-enrichment at the expense of others. It can cause us to avoid taking the time to help others or consider their input. 
        Conversely, cooperation evokes more of win/win mindset. When people come together with a mutual goal and work together to achieve that goal, everyone wins. This is why, in the end, people achieve more success through cooperation than competition.
