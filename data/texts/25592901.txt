"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"  the passage from the preamble of the US Constitution seems an injunction to have happiness as a goal, but does chasing an ill-defined feeling provide the meaing in life that will actually cause you to be happy?  I think that having the goal to make the world a better place, whether within your family or group of friends or up to the wider world, will make you more likely to achieve the state of happiness than the self-centered, inward-look quest to be happy.

Some will assert that working to help others, will make you vulnerable to people taking advantage of your helpful stance, but people who try to use your generousity for their own advantage, reveal themselves as users and making them obvious candadates for weeding out of your group of associates.  Making yourself open to others and their needs, will draw those who wish you well and those who will help you in your endeavors in the long run.

There will be no satisfaction in thinking back to the fun you had in your youth, you'll see nothing tangible to be proud of.   You want to organize your life, so when you reach old age, you can look back at your life and see that it was worthwhile.  That you didn't waste your limited time in the hedonistic pursuit of transitory pleasures.  You will, at the end of your live, find that you are surrounded by people who will truly miss you when you're gone and not just a bunch of cats waiting to eat your face after you die.
