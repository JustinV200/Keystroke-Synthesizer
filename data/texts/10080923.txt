Materialism is a part of everyone's daily life, but should it be labeled as good or bad?  Is today's society negatively affected by materialism?  Materialism, like anything else, is okay as long as it is in moderation.  Anything in life can turn negative given certain circumstances.

Everyone works in order to earn more and more money, which is then spent on things that you covet.  Some people save more in the present time, but they are saving for a materialistic end goal.  Working hard to purchase items is okay as long as it brings the person happiness.  Those items are a symbol of hard work.  You can also buy items that are significant to you and help your family.  It's amaing to be able to purchase furniture, clothes, books, toys, etc for your kids, especially if you were unable to have these type of itmes for yourself while you were a child.

However, materialism can be an issue.  If people spend more than they can afford to just to buy more and more material possessions, it can be dangerous.  People should also not depend on happiness just from the material items that they purchase.  Sometimes it's more important to focus on experiences instead of material items.   You may be able to purchase a lot of things for your child, but you also don't want them to focus more on material things instead of the joys of experiences.

Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic.  It's okay to strive to purchase certain things because they make you happy.  You just have to continue to remember that true happiness doesn't come from items you can purchase.
