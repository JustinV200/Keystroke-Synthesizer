  I believe that happiness is a process; not an end goal. It is said that happiness is achieved by either focusing on your personal goals or on the happiness of others. Though it can questioned: which method would make someone the most happy?

  It is my opinion, that neither option could be choosen as the winner to make people more likely to be happy. People are different; what motivates each person is varies vastly. Also, those motivations can change over time. We come different experiences and those experiences change and mold us. 

  I have experienced both methods throughout my life. When the course to my personal goals were blocked by something outside of my control, I would find comfort in helping those around me. I found happiness partaking in something within my control and could find compersion within the joy others felt.

   With that being said, I have experienced great amounts of pride and happiness when I hitting the benchmarks on the way to completing my goal. Seeing the results of the hard work I put in coming to fruitation is especially satisfying. 

   Though, admittedly, I have also seen both of these pursuits being fleeting. It can be heart wrenchin when the focus on your goals doesn't come to fruitation or takes an unexpected route. When the people you help aren't grateful or waste your effort, it can be demoralizing. 

   In conclusion, it is my opinion that when the focus is reliant on happiness being achieved when a goal is met is a pitfall. Instead happiness is achieved by enjoying the process. One choice is not better than the other, as long as the process is enjoyed. Being fond of the process of reaching your our goals or benefiting from the process of helping others results in the same thing: Happiness.
