         Materialism is what drives our society.  If it wasn't for material things, life would be harder to live. For example you would have to walk everywhere.  You wouldnt have a car to get you from point a to b in luxury.  We have made everyday life easy by sitting down.  We sit in chairs to eat.   Recline in them to sleep and relax.  Lounge on them to watch tv or read a book.
         Instead of going outside and traveling and exploring we are inside watching tv.  It has taken place of  the real world.  Takes us to places only our dreams can imagine.  You can be transported to concerts and sports games and tropical locations.  All from the comfort of your couch.  We even use tvs for exercise.  Instead of taking a walk or jog outside.           
           The  availability of these things have taken the place of natural movement of our bodies.  Too much sitting and not enough standing, we have become a stationary society.   All in thanks to these luxuries.  The amount of obese adults and children have become an epidemic in this country.  I dont see a solution any time soon.   And were paying for it monetarily and physically.  So get outside, enjoy the sunshine!  Take a walk!  Your body will thank you.  Society would be better off.
