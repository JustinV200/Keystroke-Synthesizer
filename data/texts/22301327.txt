What we see is not always what we get; for that matter, what we are told, is not what will will get either. We live in a world of color. A world where we see through rose colored sunglasses. We all want to fit in (whether we admit we do or not). We all want to in one way or another feel like we are able to "keep up with the Jone's" on some level. 

We are constitantly being sold something even while we are unaware of it. We are being sold things through shows we watch, endless Pinterest feeds we scroll, newsfeeds from Facebook, celebrities talking about some product they probably never actually use, but are selling us because we will eat up whatever they have to say, simply because we follow them. We either spend real money on products or our time on them in views or ratings. I know for myself, something I may buy is never as exciting as what I see from any particular ad. It loses it's luster once I take whatever home or recieve whatever package it was, try it out once and it's either making its way back to where I bought it, collecting dust on a shelf, or in my donation pile; meanwhile, whatever person or page inspired me to buy something is already onto the next shiny thing (whether it's a tangible object or an idea). 

We buy what we see, and we see it everywhere. We need to filter what is real and authentic to what we are taking from what we see. Things are rarely as they seem and often not what we might expect. We need to buy less rosy sunglasses and try on reality from time to time. It might be less fun sometimes, but it is real at least.
