Philosopers, psycholgists, priests and parishoners have pontificated about how to achieve human happiness since the dawn of civilization. Ideas range from the Epicureus, who believed in the pursuit of pleasure, to Zeno, who believed such thoughts paved a blasphomous road to perdition and ruin. 

So how are these diamentrically philosophies to be reconciled? The answer is to build a bridge between them. Happiness is best achieved when the inner Dionysian fires are tamed by the guiding light of Athene -- when the individual is connected to their soical milieu. 

When we focus on ourselves, we cut ourselves off from flow of millions of years of human existance. But if we respond by denying ourselves, we cut ourselves off from the life source that propels civilazation forward. 

The arguents pro and con the indivdual vs. the social are old and tired. Extreme positions on either side will lead to less happiness in the end. When we reconcile these two timeless streams, we begin to forge a powerful river of energy and creativity that leads to the greatest achievements of humankind: the great Golden Gate Bridge, Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics; the genetic engineerng revolution, the great ballets, cinema and art forms of every kind -- not to mention the creation of a just and flourishing society based on democratic ideals. Deny one side of the argument at the expense of the other at your peril.
