     People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. Imagine an individual who has no other people close to them in life. They are introverted and don't care about who or what is going on around them--strangers, immigrants, neighbors or just anyone in the world. It would be very hard for them to find happiness if they had to derive their happiness from others just because they have no one else in life. This means that they can only be dependent on themselves and not others. They can't find happiness in improving others's lives. 
     On the other hand, let us now imagine an individual who has many friends and family members. This person is close to others and can derive happiness from the people around them. At the same time, they also have themseleves to "depend" on where they can have a personal goal, a hobby or just anything that they can do to be happy without depending on others. This kind of people can derive happiness from two different ways.
     What do the two different contexts above tell us? On average, people are more likely to be happy if they had their own personal goals to reach because they are not reliant on others. They can set the goals and achieve them whenever and however they want, based soley on their timelines and actions. They don't have to coordinate with others to derive happiness. They don't have to find someone or something else to aim at. Therefore, I think that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals rather than on the happiness of others.
