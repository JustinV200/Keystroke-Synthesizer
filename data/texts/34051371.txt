In an increasingly competetive world. competition and cooperation remain conflicting issues  that influence individual and organization success signficantly. From a peculiar perspective, cooperation entails working together to achieve a specific objective whereas competition entails contesting for the available resources and opportunities to emerge successful. While competition plays a critical role in the current competitive world, cooperation leads to more success on the grounds that it encourages specialization and reduces conflicts.     

To begin with, cooperation encourages specialization by promoting division of labor, which consequently leads to specialization. In a competive environment, individuas are expected to maximize their potentials by executing more than one role in order to outshine their competitors. Such initiatives force people to perform streneous activities that lead to physical and emotional fatigue that significantly reduce success.  However, cooperation allows individuals to share duties and responsibilities, which makes production faster and efficient. Performing a single  activity for long makes individuals more successful as they utilize their talents and expertise.

Likewise, cooperation reduces conflicts among people, which makes them more productive and proactive. In a competetive environment, people struggle to achieve more success by outwitting others. Such practices encourage selfishness which encourages frequent wrangles and disagreements. However, when people cooperate, they create a conducive working atmopshere, which allows them to resolve disputes instantaneously, and share knowledge and experiences. Therefore, while competition triggers success by promoting innovation, cooperation reduces the burden of achieving more success by encouraging people to share their energy, skills, and resources.
