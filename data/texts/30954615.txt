A persons happiness can be determined by quite a number of aspects. This can be measured by how much satisfaction one gets from his/her accomplishment. There are many ways for one to be fulfilled and one of them is by seeing others happy. This doesn't apply to everyone, just a few select. By seeing others get or rather attain their goals really makes them feel fulfilled. It therefor makes them happy.
  Many are the timeds when different chances occur in a persons life that rarely comes back and the only way to make use of them properly is to take the chance to ones advantage. This sometimes sounds mean and selfish but is the rule of nature. People tend to go for what benefits them first the later think of otheres. It is therefore true to say that a majority of us will tjink of thenselves first than think of others. This is where the line is drawn on whetherpeople get happy by helping others or their own selves.
  The truth is plain and stands on its own. Majority of the humankind will do everything within their reach to quench their own thirst for success and happiness before they could think and consider elevating the next person. All said, people find true happiness when they focus on their personal goals compared to a small number that can help others and derive happiness from it.
