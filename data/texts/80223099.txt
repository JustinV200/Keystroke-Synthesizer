Intense rivarlries, pushing each other to achieve the limits to be the best, achieve results. One needs to look no further than sports to see how a rivalry can translate into achieving feats, innovations and milestones no one dreamed possible. Competition fosters achievement, but while rivalries produce results, a lasting legacy, acomplishments that can, quite literally, change the direction of a community and a country are brought about cooperation. It is cooperation that is the cornerstone of any successful environment. The workplace, a playing field and a community thrive when the bonds of cooperation are forged, giving everyone a chance to shape the path ahead. 

At its heart, cooperation's driving force is consensus. Consensus is reached by an amalgamation of ideas from different parties. It fosters an exchange of ideas where ideas become developed, adapted and refined. Ideas can become better. For example, a government is more functional when cooperation is valued over a rivarly. A successful government takes the best ideas from several parties and creates new, more adaptive and more robust set of policies that different factions may not have been able to achieve on their own. A set of policies drawn up by a government that values cooperation is a more successful government. 

While rivalries are responsible for great achievements in many facets of life, and our world would be dramatically different if rivarlries ceased to exist, most people do not want to live in a world were everything is a competition, where the final score is more important than the end result. Healthy competition has a time and place. I would not want to live in a world without it but cooperation is what truly leads to a successful community. Cooperation builts valuable ties that help achieve more lasting achievements. It is essential.
