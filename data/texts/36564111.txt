To achieve success most people, particulary in American society, believe that competition is the sole path towards this goal. In an individualistic society, the ability of a person to achieve great accomplishments is often in a more favorable light if those goals are accomplished on their own. However, forward progress and development is often hindered by competitive rivalries and jealousies, while cooperating on an obstacle or problem through team and group work can often bring about greater success.

Group brainstorming is a technique designed to help bring out creative and innovative ideas. To do so, a space must be established that is considered safe and nonjudgmental, where any and all ideas can be voiced and heard without criticism or disdain. Working together in a cooperative manner in this way can pave the way for innovation and out of the box thinking, which drives development and success. Furthermore, when someone faces an obstacle or mental block that they are having difficulty solving , sometimes all it takes is talking it out with a group of people to help find the answer or way forward.

When thinking of the many Nobel Prize winners, in the science field this prestigious award is often given to pairs or a group of collaborators and scientists. Working collaboratively helps spur ideas; it also helps produce long-lasting achievements. This is just one example of the ways that cooperation is just as likely, if not more so, to produce significant accomplisments and success.
