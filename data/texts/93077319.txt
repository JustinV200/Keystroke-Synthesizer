
Iam here to show that people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition. People has both cooperation and competition in their life.There are some people who achieve their goals by their cooperation and there are some people who achieve their goals by competition, that is comparing other's life.

Mostly people are interested in competition only. Because one can have the thought of overcoming others results only. One can make a successful goal by comparing himself/herself by comparing others success. So it makes easy to get up in one's life.

Some of the people will based on the cooperation in their work or anything. If they get more cooperation on their achievement only they can come to highest place in their life. One can keep on trying their best makes them to keep success in their life. If they have any supported person with them, they can climb up towards the path of success easily. So they need to ask help from others for cooperation. Everyone can cooperate with others to finish their achievement soon. Each and everyone should cooperate one another  for their success.

My conclusion is if one is based on Cooperation they can get a good result in their achievement soon. If they based on competition, only one  can win at a time. So all people  can take the option cooperation in their life as a good choice. Thank you.
