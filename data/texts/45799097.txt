Happiness is something we can agree that we all want. No matter who we are we all want happiness. But what does it take to make someone truly happy? In muy opinion focusing on the happiness of others and making the world a better place makes someone truly happy.
          Others may think that focusin on their own goals and desires is the key to happiness, but this is not the case. While you could certainly be happy and proud of your accomplishments that happiness is nowhere near the happiness one feels when helping others. 
       When you give to others you get so much back for yourself. You are able to see that your problems are truly not as big as you thought they were. You realize that you can face the issues you have as others always have it worse. It makes you experience true gratitude which is the key to happiness.
     Happiness is definitely a worthwhile pursuit. It is something we all strive for in life. There are varying opinions on what makes someone truly happy, but it is my belief that it comes from helping others.
          Giving back and making a difference on this planet, connecting with other human beings is our purpose on Earth and what creates true happiness.
