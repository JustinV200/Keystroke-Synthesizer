Images are all around us, in social media, on tv, in movies, all for our eyes to see and our brains to interpret. I believe we are bombarded with images. We are given less of an opportunity to  use our imagination, less opportunity to use our brains to form a creative opinion without prejudice.

I believe we should be able to receive information without the branding of someone else's impression of the subject. I believe it would allow people to form a much more clearer opinion. Images created by the media and advertising firms makes people believe in things that may not be true or even relevant to the subject matter being discussed.  For example, advertisers routinely include pictures of scantly dressed woman in all types of marketing campaigns that are only used to lurk customers, not really represent the products they are selling.

I see the value of imagery in media. It helps make a story fuller and is helpful in illustrating the point. I believe that imagery in media now is polluted and corrupted, so it nullifies the value it adds to the story it is attached to.

In conclusion, imagery is important, but in its present usage it has become inappropriate.
