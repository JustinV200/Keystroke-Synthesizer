We have all heard the phrase 'There's no 'I' in team", however, I believe that competition is the way to achieve more succes. Cooperation and engaging well with others is important, but I believe that the people that work the hardest and put in the most effort will achieve the most success. Sure, being liked by your boss and your coworkers is great. If you want to acheive the most success, being liked isn't always going to get you there.
In the working world, what you put in to your job is what you will get out of it. Your success depends upon how hard you are willing to work and your dedication to your job. Engaging in competition will help improve your knowledge and skills on the job. Cooperation will get people to like you, which can also help with success. It is important to have a good, reciprocal relationship with the people you work with. However, I don't think this alone will give you the most success out of your career.
Personally, when I work my hardest at my job, I feel as though I have accomplished the most. My sense of pride is at it's best when I put in effort and see any barrier I come across as a personal challenge. I do well in my field because I want to be the best at what I do. I am well aware of how many people I have around me that can do just as good of a job as I can, so I am always working to improve beacuse I strive to be the top choice. I am constantly trying to find new methods to perform better at my job.
While cooperation can help you climb the personal ladder, I think it's more important to focus on sharpenening your skills and crushing your competition. There is always more to learn at work, and there are always areas that can be improved on. I don't belive we are ever done improving and sometimes, my biggest competition is myself. So, is there really no "I" in team? I think that phrase is up for debate.
