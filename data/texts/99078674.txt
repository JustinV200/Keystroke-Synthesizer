People are addicted to the outter attractiveness of daily products. All of us are made like that to get attracted to the outter appearance of the products by the corporate companies. I would not say that it is their mistake because it is their strategy to improve their sales and build thier brand among the public. It is the consumers responsibility to not to get carried away by the images or impressions.

Many of us are buying products by their outter appearance, because it would tempt them to buy. But before that it a customer's duty to check the quality of the product. The images and the impressions would divert every customers but it is your duty to be safe on buying a product. The images and the impressions have too much effect on mainly the children. If you were a parent you would have noticed it in your kids behavior while you take them for shopping. As a parent we should try to educate our children regarding this particular corporate tactics.

In my point of view images and the impressions do have too much of an effect on people. It is every consumers duty and responsibility to be safe while purchasing products and to escape from those corporate tactics. So we should have a clear understanding that the appearance and the reality are totally different.
