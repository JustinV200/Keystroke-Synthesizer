               Happiness of a person is based on the way of life he goes on. It is not on the achiving goals or any other activity. They have to over come this wrong thought. They must intract with all the other peoples around him and make a convenient way of communication where they can get the happiness. Intracting with other peoples make humanity and a good relationship among peoples.
                 The peoples who belives that the hapiness is on the achiving goals are on the other hand. It gives them the happiness but they fail to get some good peoples and humanity and good intractions with others. This may leads to make them very unique and they could not able to be in good touch with others.
                  The peoples who have a fixed golas and move on to the way to goal may leads to a stress. They could not find any happyness on other matters and they get over distressed when they cannot able to atten the goal. So they have to take in concider their stress also. Happyness makes them stress free and gives good health.
                   but on the other way of thinking achiving the goals also makes happy, so Aching the goals and at the same time making a freindly environment helps to free the mind of the people. So making goals and also making good peoples is more important to be happy.
