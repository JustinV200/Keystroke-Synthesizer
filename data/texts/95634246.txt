I am 45 years old and I live in a van, by choice! I had a good little house in a great little town in central North Carolina. I raised my two children there. My husband and I had our own business. We no longer have that house.  Our kids grew up and started their own lives. We no longer have the business. Covid was our catalyst.

I spent most of my life collecting and gathering stuff. Expensive stuff, cheap stuff, sentimental stuff, priceless stuff. Stuff that just sat on a shelf or in a closet. I no longer have any of that stuff, other than a couple items. 

Experiences are the parts I remember. I don't grieve the stuff like I thought I would. I hardly remember what was so important about the clothes with the fancy tags or the appliances that I just had to have. None of that matters when it all boils down.I have so many wonderful memories that didn't include stuff. Like the time my daughter and son had a solo part in the choir. I remember the daffodils and how beautiful my daughter looked picking them. Or the time my son planted a garden. I could go on and on.

It's not about the stuff. I could have moved into a new house and started the business again but why?  Everything I need I have in my van. My husband and I now travel the US. Doing odd jobs and experiencing breathtaking sights and making amazing memories. The experiences we have been having are worlds beyond priceless. 
 
If everyone could peek into my life, past and present (like a fly on a wall as they say); they would see that material things are so insignificant to the big picture. I don't believe that materialism should be critisized. Everyone has their own path to take. I have been materialistic and I have been minimalistic. I am now somewhere in the middle. I have found what is important for me and I hope the rest of the world can find their way to what is important for them too.
