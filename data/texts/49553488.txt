Moden society should be criticized for being materialistic. Too much emphasis is placed on pursing material things.  People are never really satisfied with what they have.  People are trying to acquire more "stuff"  that they will never be able to cram in their coffin when they die. They are constantly pursuing more and more material things at the expense of more important things like spending quality time with their family,  helping those in need in the community, and growing in their relationships with God.  

People have misplaced their priorities.  They see others around them pursuing material things so they feel like they must do the same.  There is constant peer pressure to be more materialistic.  It really feels like a never ending rat race to see who can accumulate the most things.  There are people that have accumulated a lot of stuff over their lifetime, but they still feel unhappy.  They don't really feel fulfilled and it seems like they have spent their entire lives pursuing after things that will never satisfy them.  

In conclusion, people should focus on the things that really matter in life.  People need to focus more on their relationships with others, helping those in need, and growing in their relationships with God.  Life is too short to be spending so much time pursuing after material things that will never bring true happiness or joy.
