The pursuit of happiness is seen by some as a fundamental right but the actual attainment of happiness is harder to achieve. That is why some say that trying to help others achieve happiness will actually make you happier than trying to make only yourself happy.

Take for instance religious people. They always seem very happy. They are happy to help others because they think that that is how they will get into heaven. Even though their lives might seem boring or trivial to you as a non-believer, they are actually fundamentally happier serving others rather than only themselves.

And now think about how if you just focus on yourself and your own needs if that actually makes you happy. You probably feel more happy when you share your things with other people. That's a big thing in parenting having the kids learn to share. Kids seem more happy to play and share their things with others rather than only being alone and playing by themselves. Who can be happy with riches when they are only by themselves. Humans are fundamentally social beings who will only become truly happy and content among others. 

Therefore that is why the ellusive pursuit of happiness is unatainable when one is selfish and only thinking about themselves. It is much better to be happy helping others be happy. This is why the only way to really be happy is in the service of others.
