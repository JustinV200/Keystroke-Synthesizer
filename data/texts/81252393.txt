I've worked in cutthroat companies where it was every person for themselves and bonuses were awarded to the most productive and successful workers. I've also spent time in companies where our group pooled our resources together to tackle challenging problems and if we succeeded, everyone was rewarded. In my experience, a group that has fostered cooperation will have greater accomplishments together than if that same group worked individually and completed for the same end result.  

In any group, there are certain people with specific personality traits that reach their peak when competition is introduced. Though these people would likely be more successful on their own and competiting against others, this type of person is also suited for leadership in a cooperative group. There's also types of people that quickly lose confidence after bad performances when they realize that they don't match up with the most successful people in competitions. It's this type of person that has the most success with cooperation. And they become even stronger group members as they gain confidence from successfully contributing to the group. 

Cooperation ensures that although some members might have individual weaknesses that would harm them competitively, their weaknesses can be masked by the strengths of others. And even the most successful workers have weaknesses that you might not expect. The strengths and weaknesses of the overall group will balance out and the team will produce signifcant, lasting accomplishments that will far outstrip the accomplishments of singular workers in competition.
