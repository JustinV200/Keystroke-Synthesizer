As soon as we step out our front doors, the world floods us with advertising to try to influence us to think or feel a certain way. Companies try to persuade us to buy certain products or spend our money at particular stores.  We all only have a limited amount of money, and advertisers want to make sure that you spend your allotment on their product. However, how much of what they tell us is really honest?

Advertising is often skewed to make products and services appear better than what they actually are. Companies are decietful and use psycological tactics to get us to buy. For example, Target, will often suck us in to buying double or triple the amount than what we originally planned on. But how? One way Target does this is to use color to influence us.  The color red influences us and makes us want to shop. 

Another example of making shoppers buy more is the way grocery stores stock their shelves. Do you ever wonder why the bread and milk is always in the back, far corner of the store? It is there for a specific reason.  Companies know that people will run into the store to grab bread and milk.  Therefore, they want you to have to walk through the entire store to expose you to all the advertising and all the products so that you will be persuaded to buy more.

These are just a few examples of the countless ways that companies use ads and manipulation to create a reality to make us buy their products. It is impossible to avoid being exposed to these influences, but we must try our best to see through them.
