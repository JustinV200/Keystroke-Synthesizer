We live in a time when media dominates most of our lives. We are constantly inundated with images of airbrushed celebrities who instruct us to purchase whatever product pays them the most. It would be easy to condemn this reality as misleading, because it is. You may want to jump on your soapbox to take down the corporate bigwigs who are responsible for these intrustions on your life. But before you pick up your pitchfork, consider the alternative.

What if the reality perpetuated by the media was, well, a little more realistic? Imagine advertising that was a little more honest. "Our shampoo is basically water that will neither add volume or shine!" Or better yet, let's hear from a politician who tells the truth. "In the next four years I will only keep a few on my promises and none of them will be issues you care about!" Voter turnout would plummet.

Perhaps a better way to perceive the inconsistencies in the images that flood our phones it to take them at face value. The ads that promote a shiny new toy to play with should be accepted as just that - a commodity for sale. One that you do not need to act upon or even give your attention to if it does not interest you. Your time is precious and you decide who gets it. Only when you learn to think for yourself and tune out the distractions will you harness the power the media has taken from you.
