     In the modern days, people are very consumed with the appearance of everything around them. They care about how they look, and how people perceive them. It seems that appearance is more important then the role people actually play in life. 
     Wherever we go, we see beautiful things. The advertisements are everywhere. Beautiful clothes, beautiful people, this is what catches our attention. All these things that we see is what inspires us to be even better. Companies that know how to sell their products well, hire influencers to advertise their products to people. Children and teens look up to their favorite celebrities and pay attention to what they wear, and how they look. They try to also copy that in their life. Trends change every year and people pay attention to what is fashionable so they can keep up. Everything we see has a meaning. All the products help us make each one of us the way we are, the way we present ourselves. We all have our self image and we continuously work on that throughout our life. 
     It all gets to a point where appearance matters more then the morality and our inner self. Sometimes we forget that we can be ugly on the inside but people could not see that, because we look good on the outside. Sure, it's important to have a good appearance! It is needed to be presentable at work, and in our daily life. It is even more important to have good morals, and to be a good person. Our society needs nice and caring people. 
     Overall, there is a need for everyone to be happy. We need to be able to combine the aspects of good intentions and good perceptions of people and things in our life. We all need to strive for better things. This is what gives us meaning to live and be happy.
