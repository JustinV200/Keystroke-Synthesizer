Materialism is a huge problem in modern society, today. People tend to think it is meaningful and a way to provide happiness, when in all reality, that just is not true. It causes more harm than it does good. Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because it does more harm than good.

Being materialistic does nothing to teach our youth how to save and spend money wisely. It is teaching the younger gerneration bad ways of handling money which is not setting a good example for them when they get older. When you are materialistic, you buy things that you want and not things that you need. By doing this you are setting yourself up for failure and running out of money at the cost of just buying what you want.

Material things are just that. They are things. If you come from a rich family or have a lot of money, normally you have more things than you really do need. How does that make anyone truly happy? It doesn't. Maybe it does in the moment. But, it does not in the long run. You are not able to truly enjoy what you have when you are constantly buying things sue to being materialistic.

What about someone that does not have a lot of money or that comes from a poorer family? These people sometimes revert to stealing to try to keep up with the materialistic people of the world. They think they need these that others have in order to fit in. There only hope in having these things, a lot of the time, is to steal them. If not stealing they work and use the money they need for bills on stuff that doesn't truly matter.

To sum it up, materialism or being materialistic is not a good thing. There is more harm that comes form being materialistic than there is good that comes from it. Because of this, modern society should be critized when it comes to materialism.
