Times Square is awash with bill boards and avertisements for  everything from high fashion to soft drinks. Buildings in Tokyo have gigantic video boards from which the advertisements seem to leap. Super Bowl ads cost millions of dollars, google's revenue is based around ads. In fact, the entire internet's financial structure is based around ads. In a capitalistic society run by gigantic corporations, image and perception are everything, and that's not always a good thing for you or me.

Instagram is a commonly used app for young women, who follow influencers and celebrities. Both of these fill their feeds with  shots of glamorous vacations and sexy photo shoots. The most powerful influyencers command rates of  a quarter of a million dollars for a single post, so great is their reach.

For corporations and growing businesses, this kind of promotion of their products and services is invaluable. But for the average person, it is selling a highly unrealistic version of life that does not mirror the experiences of most people. Mental health issues among young people have skyrocketed due to social media and easy access to  the lives of others, which gives people more opportunities than ever to compare their own lives against. In recent years there have been  attempts to normalize things like body positivity and rooting more ads in representing more realistic demographics in advertisemen, but the practice of advertisers remains.

Is is it feasible for corporations and advertisers to have theri cake and eat it too?  Can they push their products through social media without negatively influencing people. Can they refrain from ads that induce fear of missing out in users? These are questions that are still unanswered as of yet, but could feasibly be yes in the future, if further care is taken.
