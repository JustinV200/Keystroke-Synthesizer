Many peoples are concetrating on their own dreams and their own personal life goals. But it is going to given happiness to them and thier own family. It does not going to given more happiness than making joyful them by help other peoples who needs help.
One of my friend is working as a customer support manager who helps people who needs help. He always says it gives more happiness than his own success. He looks for the stray animals also in his free time. He took a little drive during a night time, looks for stray cats. He immedietly picks the stray cat or dog in his bare hands. Then he took it to his house to given a good bath. It will clean their fleas and prevent many skin issues to the stray animals.
After a bath, He will give a good food which is suitable for the animals. It costs him most of his income of job. Still he doen't neglect to help stray animals. He always says that he is getting a lot of happiness because of helping than personal goals. 
After realise that, I am also trying to help stray animals and peoples who needs help. It gives me more happiness than succeed my own personal goals. I am trying to given helps towards peoples and animals who needs them.
