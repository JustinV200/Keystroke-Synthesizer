Materialism is the process and love of acquiring and spending money. Is it a good thing or is it a bad thing? In this paper I am going to discuss why I think materialism is good, why we should not criticize others for being materialistic. Who doesnt love making money? Even more spending it?
People get meaning by working and earning material things that make their lives more comfortable and meaningful. A person finds fulfilments in knowing that their hardwork counts, maybe in the provision of the basic human needs to his family, or by making their lives easy and comfortable.
We all like to live a good life, right? eat good food, go on vacation, be able to afford good clothes and cars and own a nice home, all this is not possible without material wealth, therefor no person should frown upon another person for wanting all these things for themselves and their family. 
That said and done, some people may argue that materialism can lead to some ills in society, like killing and commiting other crimes as a means of achieving these goals, these are exceptions and as long as one does not hurt another person in the process then there is problem.
Therefor I conclude by saying that as long as you have a clean conscious, go a head and make the money, gain material things and make your family and loved ones happy.
