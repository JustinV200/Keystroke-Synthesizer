Happiness is a sense of well being,  joy or contentment. The happiest day in my life was when I visited my uncle. My uncle loves travelling we woke up early in the morning. Some believe that happiness comes by pursuing their dreams and their own personal goals. Others believe that people are happy only when they have their minds fixed on some goal other than their own happiness.

One of the happiest moments ever is the courage to let go of what you can't change. Accordingly, of others or on the improvement of humanity. Aiming at something other than their own happiness, they find happiness along the way.

I think that the happiest moment in my life, at the new year dinner. It is the best memory because my grandmother was still alive. We had a great time, I remember that we were laughing all time of everything and nothing, it was a great time. I have always been in love with holidays, with the spirit and all that kind of stuffs; I like how small things can make you feel happy, and you don't need anything else like money can buy things but doesn't buy happiness. Happiness for me is being around the happiest life.

The Happiest moment is one of my life to had an them. Is the great time and always my destination as happiest life to them.
