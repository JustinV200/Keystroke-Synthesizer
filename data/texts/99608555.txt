Happiness, definitely one of many words that has a vast array of meanings. Goals, yet another word with a myriad of meanings. Meanings, interpretations, definitions, etc, no matter where you go, who you talk to about this topic, there'll be several answers.

Which is more important in the pursuit of happiness, our personal goals or the happiness of others? Or are the two somehow intertwined, at least for some.
What exactly is a goal? Can the happiness of others, or happiness itself not be a goal? Can it also be a personal goal for some?

There are folks that are very goal-oriented and even goal-driven. Each individual determines what their personal goals are and how to attain them. How does emotional well-being play into this? If personal goals are related to interests, dreams, talents, that should increase emotional health levels. 

There are folks that find their happiness in the happiness of others. They could set personal goals related to someone else's happiness as well, with the outcome determining their own level of happiness. 

How do we discern which avenue leads to more happiness? Can we compare happiness levels with others no matter the source?

Happiness is different for everyone. What makes one person happy would never make another person happy. Each one of us determine what makes us happy and how to achieve that happiness. Attempting to say that focusing on one's personal goals will result in a higher level of happiness as opposed to focusing on the happiness of others is simply not possible.

There can be no blanket answer for this question because it's all relative. Being true to our authentic selves and living accordingly should result in happiness, whether personal goals are included or making someone else happy. At the end of the day, all of us should be happy if we stay true to who we are and act accordingly.
