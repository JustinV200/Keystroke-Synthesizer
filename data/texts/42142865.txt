Impression is the wonderful word to attract someone. This impression will create mostly by advertisement. Advertisement place the major role in the product promotion. Based on the advertisement it creates some impression about the product rather than a quality of the product. we buy a product generally based on the advertisement and packaging inwhich film industry actor or actress who act in the advertisement for that product instead of the content or quality of the product. So based on that impressions we are ready to buy  that product.

On july 2021, I bought one new brand cooldrink. Its packaging is wonderful and attractive to buy. In that package indicates it was a whole fruit juice no added chemicals or preservatives. On that night  i had a severe vomiting. I went to hospital doctor told me it was food poison. I gave test for that juice. It has some preservative and chemical which is not good for peoples health. Its for an adult k its just a vomit.  If it happen to child it may danger to that child life also.

So please make sure that quality and the content is very important rather than a advertisement and packaging. We should read the packaging.We should get some more awarness about the false impressions. Because images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. The company should consider the peoples life. So mention the proper content on the package instead of giving attractive model and images. So don't create false impression to the people to buy your product.
