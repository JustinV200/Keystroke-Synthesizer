The new playstation five was unvieled at a Sony marketing event. Now, I'm not the type of person to get all excited and gleeful at the site of a machine but this was something different. A new state of the art graphics processor, a new haptics technology in the controller, an amazing game lineup. I could feel the dopamine rush as I looked at the masterpiece Sony put together and I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time: Happiness. 

Some people think that humans don't actually need material possesions. That we would be much happier without them. Many religious and spiritual teachers rail against materialism. Could they be right?

Who are we without things?  What would Christmas be without gifts under the tree? How about birthday parties? A wedding without a gold and diamond ring? Would a world without materialism truly exist? Can we seperate human from possesion. Would the economy look like without materialism? 

I think the harder you look at the debate of materialism, the more questions you ask, the more obvious the answer is; humans have an innate need for posessions. It is part of the human experience. There are too many festivities that depend on them. So many of the memmories we make involve material things. 

Although we need things. It doesn't mean there isn't consequences to a materialist world. Some people can form an addiction to aquiring new posessions. They can go into debt. They work too much and end up having mental health issues or their family relationships begins to suffer. There have been many tragic stories of people who let posessions control them. 

Nothing in this world is completely good or completely bad. This goes for mateiralism too. Materilism supplies us with so much joy but also pain. Overall though, it is obvious that our posessions enrich our lives.
