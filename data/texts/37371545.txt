        Around us is perfection. Images and appearance on people and products are constantly fabricated to appear perfect. Ads, social media, videos, movies, everything is shows as better than what reality is. This has caused an immense amount of influence on people, usually in a very negative way. We have accepted these fabrications as reality and have made us  think that is what reality is.

       We think the people around us are poreless, thin, perfect and we hold ourselves to those negative unachievable standards. We want perfect products in the food we consume, the clothes we buy, thebeauty products we buy because they are shown in advertisement and pictures as perfect. This has affected how we perceive what real products should work in real life like. People have also fabricated an online image to seem perfect, easygoing, wealthy life which has affected how we think. 

       People are now thinking they should look a certain way, the products they buy should behave a certain way and what types of life famouns and influences live. This affects us negatively by holding many aspects of our lives to un unachievable standard. This affects our self esteem, our shopping habits and how we treat each other. We should look at what reality and real people are made out of and accept ourselves that way.
