Walk down the halls of any high school in America, and the issue will become apparent. Image matters. But does it matter too much? I am of the belief that the answer is yes; image matters too much. In fact I will go as far to say that the average, middle income American, has very little understanding of what they are spending their time admiring and their money buying, in a desperate attempt to fulfill someone elses ideal image. 

During the holidays busy shoppers rush from store to store in search of that perfect gift. But what exactly does that perfect gift look like? Why it has a big glitered box, a shiny ribbon, and inside is a beautifully displayed lipbalm that normally sells for $2.00 on a cash registers shelf. And you can have it all for $10.00! Next door we find a grand display of heavy duty tins, with winter scenes enveoped around them. A horse drawn sleigh, a few jingle bells, and of course a snowman built by two tiny tots. It's a must have gift this time of year and you can get this $3.00 worth of flavored popcorn for only $35.00! I know, I know, it's supposed to be "fun". But does it really have to be that much "fun"? Why do we automatically assume that just because something is wrapped in a bright and exciting way that it will be a more enjoyable experience of owning it? Ask any woman who has ever had an Ipsy subscription. No woman needs all the cosmetic bags that we get with our products!

Humans are social creatures and have a longing to belong to a group, a family, with which they can identify.  The image we portray is important so that we find "our people". It enables us to develope friendships and relationships to support us throughout life. But it's time that we recognize the value of what is wrapped inside that image and make sure its worth it. The last thing we want is to find out is that our beautiful, shiny, bestfriend is just a big tin of $3.00 popcorn.
