First of all thank you giving me this opportunity to express my thoughts about materialism.At first it is misunderstood as a way to have actual happiness. And, Materialism dissorts the meaning of material. It refers to a personality traits. Most of the people think success is judged by things. Materialism can affect peoples physical health and mental health. They believe that buying branded products are necessery means to achieve important goals and happiness. They believe in products , brands and price tags . People now-a-days sacrifice anything including their health to earn money. Many people living in a different world where their first priority is cash, positions , status and luxirious lifestyle. They cant understand efforts and positive energy will help to develop and achieve their goals. They think money is important than family and friends. Spending lots of money is not necessary we should avoid unnessary things . Most of them buying branded items for showing themself. We should live our own life. We can find that simple reminder of the people community value the resonable with whom the society helps to reduce the habits of materialism. We should save money for necessery needs. It can make them feel insecure , anxious and feel difficult. ThankYou ...
