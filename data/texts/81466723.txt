Actually where to dot start about the cooperation or competition, first of all there is no conflict between these two word why i say is that you can insert co-operation on competition especially if the person has been competiting as single, but if the competiong consist of team competition another team then there is definetly competition has cooperation.

No one can win the competition without hard or soft work, because you need an complex mind and emotional way of mind to achieve the goal with your cooperation as single player or competitor, what are the way we take the responsibele about the world, we can never achieve the goal with complex mind with cooperation, but the first point comes to mind after hearing this quesiton is i would yes 50 perecent of the peopole achieve it if only the opposite competitor works with other competitor supports.

I would say its a healthy way of competiton with cooperation, ther are some peopl in the world who trie dto achive the goal as very single person, but you can achieve with only 100 percent of focus, i would say its is very difficult to achieve accordint to human nature, but very end to this the simple answer is "YES".
