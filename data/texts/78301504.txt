         The definition of happiness is not something that is easily defined. Our society tries to dictate to us what our happiness is and convince us that we will find happiness if we follow the social norm, buy the popular products, have the biggest house, have the most expesnisve car, have the best body, etc. Our brains are constantly bombarded with someone else's definition of what our happiness is or what our happiness should be.                                                                                                                        
          People will likely be happier if they shift their focus to making others happy instead of focusing on their personal goals. The material objects in life can only provide short-term satisfaction. They do not provide us with any long-term sense of purporse. We need to know deep down that there is a reason we are here. Driving a fast car and having a nice home can provide us with a comfortable life but they do nothing to help us determine our purpose for being on this planet. I grew up in a relatively wealthy family and did not live without much in terms of high-quality materials, yet I was miserable. I did not know why I was here, why my mother cried every night, why she tried to end her life, why my dad pretended nothing was wrong, and why everyone else was living a life of happiness while I was living a misarable, lonely one.                                                       
           When I turned 18, my happiness appeared the day my first daughter was born. My new purpose was my family. My new purpose was my job and helping those around me.  My mother felt like she had no purpose and that is why she cried and tried to end her own life. My father did not know how to help my mother which is why he sat in silence. Social media contributed to my false belief that others were happy and the only reason I was lonely was because I chose to be.
