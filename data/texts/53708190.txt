 People acheieve success in different ways, and it can come differently to people. Two common was to acheive success is by cooperation or by competition. While both ways can be useful, I think that success is more acheivable through competition.

  We start to learn how to compete with others during childhood. When other students get a better grade on a test, we naturally want to compete to get the highest grade on the next test. We compete to get in the best colleges, to get the best jobs, and for the best homes and cars. Competition drives success in my opinion, because we have the natural instinct to do better than those who we think are doing better than us. We don't want to be seen as a failure, and competition makes us thrive for success. We even compete against ourselves sometimes. We want to go past were we just came from, and we want to be more successful the older we get and the further we go in life.

  In conclusion, there are many ways to acheive success. In my opionion, people acheive more success by competition because we have the natural drive to do better than other people. Competition can be the main source of inspiration for success, because we want to be the best in all we do, and we don't want others to do better than us.
