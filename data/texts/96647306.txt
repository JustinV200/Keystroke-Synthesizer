This will about about materialism and the question; should society be criticized for it?

Most, if not all, people in modern society spend a good deal of their lives in pursuit of material goods. It seems as if in theses modern times, few things are as important to the average person than to aquire material goods. Whether it be for show, status, competition or all of the above. People seem to put a lot of emphasis on the aquisition of material goods. Most people will even look down on others if they do not have a lot of material possessions.

For example, a lot of people compete with one another when it comes to material goods. They seem to want to impress others with thier possessions and feel inferior to those who have more than them. So most people are in an endless pursuit of material posessions because the competitve nature of aquirring more than others drive them. 

Some will say that this type of competition is the law of nature, but I personally think that it is not the law of nature, but people's minds which have been shaped and molded by television and other forms of media where they always see others seemingly doing well and being happy because of the material goods they have aquired in their lives. I think most people are easily influenced like this.

In conclusion, while most will say this is just a natural response, I think it is because of the programming we have all gone through. It is a sad fact that most of us fall victim to that programming and end up on an endless pursuit of material goods. So yes, I do believe society should be criticized for it because there are a lot more important things for one to focus on besides accumilating material goods. In the end, I think everyone will eventually realize that material goods can never make you truly happy.
