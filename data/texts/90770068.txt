When it comes to the topic of materialism, it can be quite touchy.  But yes, modern society should be criticized.  I say this because of the fact that we are living in a day and age of social media where appearances are everything.  Influencers, celebrities, etc., have a lot to do with why we are the way we are.  
When you look at this day and age, with the technological advances, social media, influencers, and celebrities have a lot of pull on a lot of things.  We also are human.  Society has always needed to have the next big thing regardless of cost.  Its a dog eat dog world out there and everyone is always fighting to be the first to get the newest gadget, accessory, outfit seen on runways or our favorite celebrity was wearing.  Celebrity endorsements also fuel our need for material objects because in our minds, it will make us feel closer to them let alone be "like" them.
I will say that not everyone is this way.  I for one, don't always need the next best thing, and there are people out there that do care less about what society thinks about them if they do not have the means or the desire to buy the newest things that influencers or celebrities are endorsing.  Also, companies and factories are also making more items to keep up with the market demand.  So if anyone would try to blame the companies, you have to look at society and the supply and demands.  
In conclusion, I feel that it works both ways.  Materialism has always been an issue, and with social media being the ultimate platform for material things and ways to "keep up appearances" that is how modern society is to be the blame.  Businesses are only doing what is expected of them.
