Notably, many people around the world have different ways of finding their own happiness in life. With that understanding of the idea, I believe that people are more likely to be happy when they are following  their own passsion, and goals. I'm meaning that people shouldn't always be obligated into feeling that they should be following the ways of finding happiness within others. For instance, with me, I personally have a passion for singing, and this activity not only makes me happy, but it also motivates me as well. 

So, before people start debating about the understanding on how people are obtaining their own happiness, we need to first come to a realization that a person's happiness could be based on not only your own personal growths, but also by making a difference in other people's lives. Take the idea of community service, when you are helping someone who is in need that is not only making the person you are helping happy, but also yourself. 

Personally, with me having a huge passion for helping others, and also making a difference in this world I found it interesting to learn about how many people have different perspectives about what they feel that they should focus on especially when it comes to the idea of their own happiness. Ultimately, I believe that the idea of happiness can both be based on not only from your own personal career goals, but also your impact that your having in society as well.
