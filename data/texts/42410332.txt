Images and impressions portrayed on social media, print media and on television definitely have too much of an effect on people. Americans are bombarded with fake news, images and stories all day long, every day and what we see just isn't reality. 

Fake images are easy, even for everyday people, to create and post in todays world. Snapchat, facebook messenger and even your simple phone camera allows filters to be used that can make a person look entirely different. There isn't even a need to put makeup on anymore. This does not even begin to go into what can be done by proffessionals with a large budget to create and edit pictures, making people feel even worse about their own, real lives. 

Using colorful or elegant packaging for a product of platering the face of a famous celebrity on the front of the package can convince a person that they need a product they don't really need. When a famous person promotes a product, they most likely have never even used the product, but people tend to believe whatever they say. We buy things based on how we want others to see us. It often doesn't matter if they product is actually functional or if we can get a more useful product for a cheaper price. 

A great example of this is advertisements geared towards children. Cartoon characters that talk, foods that make the children in the commercials have powers, toys that do nothing like they show in the commercials. All of these things get the children to want the toys and then once they have them, they play with them for 10 minutes and then they sit in the toybox forevermore. Even pull ups are advertised with disney characters printed on them. 

Our mental health would be so much better if we were to turn off the television and delete our social media apps. Spend time outside and with people that we can make new experiences and memories with.
