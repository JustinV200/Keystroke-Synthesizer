Most of us, myself included, try to avoid being too materialistic. Nevertheless, it's unavoidable. We have to eat, we need a roof over our heads, we need sources of income to provide for those things. Modern society with it's advertising convinces us that we need much more than the necessities. A nice car, fine clothes, gourmet food are among the things which many people have come to regard as necessities.

It is possible, I believe, to reject this mindset. When I was in the army all of my posessions fit into a wall locker and a foot locker. Army chow was perfectly edible. I was as happy then as I am now. All the stuff with which I have surrounded myself doesn't make me happy.

On the other hand my grandson is entering college. He's very smart and to not educate him would be sinful. This will cost an enormous sum of money over thee next four years. I shall dicipline myself and make as much money as possible to help him out, regardless of how materialistic this will be.

It will be possible, I think, to fulfill my moral and familial obligations, maintain a comfortable existance, and at the same time avoid getting too enamoured of the material things. It will require a sense of balance, but I'm confident that I can pull it off.
