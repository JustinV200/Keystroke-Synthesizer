They say that money can buy happiness. They also say that money is the root of all evil. Let's say that you get two gifts for your birthday; the first gift is a handmade gift that took time to make, and the other one is the same gift, but bought from the store. For most people, they are going to appreciate the handmade gift that you made even if it's not as good as the one that was bought at the store.  I believe that modern society should be criticized for being as materialistic as we are as a society. 

Being too materialistic makes society lose sense of life. We aren't living anymore. Everybody just surviving and getting by. Living in a materialistic world brings out jealousy, envy, greed, hate, and people who are not good for you. The materialistic world is lonely. When you get to the top and you realize you have no one around. No amount of money can buy you happiness. It can't make you unlonely. 

Who doesn't like nice things? We all have phones, laptops, gaming consoles, etc. We want that nice car, nice house, nice clothes. I do believe that when you work hard, you should be able to buy yourself or your family material things. 


My opinion and where I stand on if we should be criticized on society being too materialistic stays the same. I do think we should be criticized. Life isn't about what you have, where you live, or what you wear. I think that we get lost in all the material things that life has to offer that sometimes we forget who we really are deep down. Time is the only thing you can't get back. I think we spend too much of our time focused on the things that we can always get back.
