Happiness is a very personal emotion. An emotion is not easy to controll.  I belive that if you focus on your own goals, and acheive them this  will then allow you to focus on other peoples goals and their happiness. To help someone is not a selfless act, to invest your emotions on others happiness is not the same.

Some people will allow other peoples happiness determine their state of mind and pursuit of their own goals.  If someone is not happy, and are unable to reach their goals to make them happy, it will seep into your emotions.  But, if you reach your goals and are happy and reached your goals, it will give you a stronger connection to your happiness and will not soak in the other peoples unhappiness.  Personal Goals and happiness is a state of your  mind not someone elses.

You may help someone acheive a Goal and be happy for them i belive this is not the same happiness. The emotion of Happiness is for them and not  for ones self and your own goals.  This may impeade your own happiness because of other emotions that might follow such as jealousy.

In conclusion, I think that you focus on the happiness of others before yourself you will never be able to attain TRUE happiness. Take care of youself and the rest will follow.
