 First of all I would like to thank for giving me the opputunity to express my thoughts. So here we go.....

 As per the quote that was too famous " Picture moves the people more than the words" people were always have more effect on the image and impression than the words. People often go the looks of the people as they never care about their words or character. In somecases it also leads to the severe problem.

  Let me explain with the great example . If a person who is an actor with so much of talent and knowledge people will never accept him if he looks so disgusting as people always go for the image of the person  .At the same if an actor who looks more handsome people were dragged towards him just like the mangnet eventhough doesn't have  any talent.

  In like these cases it is easy for the people who were judgemental only for image but it have and gives so much of negativity and impact for the people who were judged. So whoever it may be everyone should think before making such decision .  Like the proverb "Don't judge the book by it's cover" we have to look into the person's character, talent , knowledge and so many things then only we have to make the decision.

 Thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to express my thoughts. Have a great time of reading and also the wonderful day ahead.
