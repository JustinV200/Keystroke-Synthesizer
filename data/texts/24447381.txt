Cooperation and competition can both be important ways to achieve success. Cooperation can keep build people up, get them to come together, and create something that has everyone's input. And competition can bring determination and drive out of a person that normally would not be so successful if not pushed. Overall I feel that competition brings better results.
Competition is one of the laws of nature. When it comes to survival and passing on genes, it is the fittest and strongest of species that succeed. The weaker competitors fall to the wayside and die out. Strength drive and power help win in competition. That can be applied to anything in life. Dating, education, sports, careers. It is always best to be the best. To be on top. That drive will always get you ahead in life. And set you apart from your competitors.
Now cooperation can also be a great way to succeed. Coming together with like-minded individuals, or even individuals with different viewpoints, can always add value to any goal or accomplishment. Cooperation lets everyone take on a task that they are best at or most comfortable with, and at the end the group can bring it all together. It can give everyone a chance to be heard and feel a sense of accomplishment.
Either method, be it competition or cooperation, can be useful depending on the application and the goal. But for the most part, I think what brings out the best and brightest ideas is tough competition. That makes you rise to the occasion. And in the end the pride you will feel will all be worth it. People love to win, and that alone can drive them to come out on top and be a success.
