I believe that images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. These images and impressions are seen everywhere, when scrolling through Facebook, when watching your favorite television show or when shopping for groceries. The media and advertisers are constantly trying to persuade people and convinvce them that they need a product.

One example of this that recently happened to me is that I bought some new leggings off of Amazon. After this I have seen numerous ads targeted towards me for leggings. They make many different claims about how great they are and I have seen so many ads while on social media or on the internet. I have been tempted to purchase more of these leggings based on these targeted advertisements even though I do not need them and it would not be a financially sound decision for me.

Another example of this is in my life as a parent. My son watches a lot of shows on channels like Disney Junior and Nickelodeon. The advertisments for kids toys and products are full of color and loud music and strongly appeal to young kids. My son sees a commercial for a simple Paw Patrol truck that has the dogs talking and music playing and thinks it will be the greatest toy ever and begs for it. He just sees Paw Patrol and fun and excitement and not the fact that they are trying to sell a basic toy that he will be bored of in a few minutes that costs way too much money.

As a society we need to make sure that we are not being persuaded and effected too much by images and impressions in the media and advertisement. We need to be knowledable of the fact that big corporate is just trying to take our money so the rich can become richer. We need to focus on small businesses and not getting caught up in the glitz and glam of name brands and advertisements.
