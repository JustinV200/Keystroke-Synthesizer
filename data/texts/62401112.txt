Do you cry in the pillow when you are under stress? Or do you thrive when you know that somebody is back to back with you on all your work projects? 

We are all different: some of us love to be competed, others prefer just to enjoy their boring adult life. It is totally fine to be who you are, there is no shame in both. However,  I personally think that people love to compete when they are younger, when they don't have family with little kids. When you are "a real adult" you just want to save all the extra energy to spend it with your family members. You understand that competetion doesn't work on the long run. 

Of course, there are some magical people who can perform great only under stress. Hooray to them! However, the majority of us just want to be surported and to cooperate. That's why there are a lot of support forums, study groups, where people are ready to share their ideas and help each other. Remember the old saying: "You scretch my back, I will screch yours"? Yes, It is about cooperation as well.

Sure, cooperation may not be the best way to be successful in the short run. But in the long run it is definately a way to go. We don't want to be burnt at work in the first couple of years. We would love to cherish ourselves and to keep ourselves sane for as long as possible. 

Of course, people like to compete not only at work. People compete with their neigbors, friends and family members. Sometimes we don't even understand it, but somehow it bothers you when your friend's wife looks better then yours. Yes, we still have a lot of from animals in us, we want to compete.  But we are better then that. It is important to understand that cooperation is a smoother and a less stressful way of doing things. Why should we make our life more complicated?! It is difficult enough without tring to find out, who has the greener grass and the better job. Want to enjoy the life to the fullest? Just find a right team and enjoy your cooperation with them!
