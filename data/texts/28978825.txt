To begin, thanks for inviting me to write this essay. I am not the best writer, however I am going to try to do the best I can here with this assignment. Sometimes my thoughts and words get mixed up inside of my head and can't put on paper for some reason.                      

Being materialistic I don't think is good for anybody to get ahead. This is something a lot of people deal with daily. Stay true to yourself, because God hasn't made any mistakes when it comes to his people.

I don't think modern society should be critized for being materialistic, because like I said before being materialistic doesn't help you. I think it hurts you more than you could ever think. Live with what is given to you and move on in life and don't look at what others have and with that was you because you don't know what they had to go through to get what they have. 

Look at what you have and what you worked for and move on in life, you are only given one life to live so live it to the best of your abilty and don't look back at the things you never had. Good things always comes to those that wait on the Lord. Be patient with yourself because life is a gift from the almighty and should not be taken for granted.

Now that I am at the end of this essey I think I did better than I thought I would alotted the time I was given. And not being able to use the internet for help. It was harder than I thought. Thanks for testing my ability to do something outside of my comforate zone.
