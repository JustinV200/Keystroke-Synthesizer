No, People should not be criticized for being materialistic. It is their choice and it is not bad. There is an opinion about the materialistic people 'they are selfish'.  No they are not selfish. They find owning and buying things are making them happy and  desirable.  We have only one life. We should live our life for ourself and do what makes us happy.  Materialism is a natural characteristic of humans. We can find it in every human. 
Materialistic people love to do what gives them pleasure. For example buying branded goods  and services. Because of them economy also gets benefit. According to me there is no wrong in it.  If they have enough money, they can spend it.  Materialism contributes to personal fulfillment and inner happiness. Materialism may increase self motivation and self confidence. It may encourage to work harder.
Materialism has a bad image in some people's point of view.  Rather than making efforts to destroy it, individual consumers,businesses and policymakers should focus on using it for  promoting collective interests that benefit the society very much. Materialism can stimulate consumer desire to some extent and stimulate achievement motivation. It also stimulates commodity demand, thereby promoting economic prosperity and social progress.
