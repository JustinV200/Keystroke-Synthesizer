     We shouldn't be criticized for being materialistic in our society today because our world has changed so drastically in the last decade. Of course I define materialism as being selfish and even as a bad person. We are always depending on things and wanting to upgrade things and needing new things. It has become our new normal, aswe have come to depend on these things more and more every day.
      In today's time, technology is only one example of our basic materialistic need. Each of us has a cellphone, a tablet, a computer, or a laptop. We also have tvs and dvd players, satelites, ect. With more and more smart technology being produced, we are depending on our things in our day-to-day. Without our smart assistants, we may be late to work, miss an important meeting, or not be productive at work at all. I think that since the pandemic hit the entire world, losing so many things and so many people, many of us are weary of losing our things, tending to accumulate even more things. And finally, in our society today if you try to get a job or make a big purchase like a house or a car, then these things are recommend and sometimes even required. 
     In conclusion, I don't feel like being materialistic makes us bad people, or makes us selfish, even though some would disagree. I feel like we don't have a choice in the matter, because that is the world we live in, and we should all face up to that little fact. What will we be like twenty years from now?
