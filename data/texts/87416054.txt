People's happiness comes in many different forms and there are many ways people can find happiness in life. Some say certain people are happy when helping others, focusing in their own goals and dreams or focusing on improving humanity. 

To find true happiness, people should focus on achieving their goals and dreams. Their journey to their goals and dreams are what makes achieving it so much better. Although, there are other ways people may achieve happiness in life, goals and dreams are what makes people truly happy.

When people are kids, they make goals and dreams to motivate themselves to achieve what they think is best for them. Even if these goals and dreams are small and achievable while they are kids, it still made people happy that they were able to achieve them. But as they grow older, they may change their dream and focus on working towards that dream. With long term dreams there are also small goals that they may achieve that helps them get closer to achieving the dream. Achieving these small goals is another way people can find their happiness in because it may seemed to them that they are a step closer to achieving their dreams.

Some may say that having goals and dreams does not make people happy. Others may think that because not being able to achieve a small goal may seem like their dreams is so far away and not achievable. This may seem like a good arguement against that but it's because of experiencing failure that people can find their happiness when their dreams are finally achieved despite failing at first.

All in all, people having goals and dreams is one way for them to find happiness in life. But they are not limited to just this reason in finding happiness. There are so many ways that people can find happiness and they can also combine their reasons to be happy about in life.
