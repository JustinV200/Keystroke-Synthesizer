I believe that cooperation is more effective than competition. People can often accomplish a lot more while working together and collaborating ideas and strategies than if they were independently pitted against one another. I am personally not a competitive person and enjoy playing my role on a team, and am not motivated by winnin or losing. If a person is able to focus all of their energy on one aspect of a project or goal, they are able to make sure that aspect is completely taken care of. This also allows people to use their strengths and weaknesses together rather than letting them hinder the project.

While some people are motivated by the drive to be the best or show their skills or talents, one point of view is limited and there is only so much that one can accomplish alone. This is all dependant on what is trying to be accomplished, but overall if people are able to assemble for a common goal it turns out much more thoroughly thought out in the end. The sense of accomplishment rather than wanting to be the best must be the motivation. This success of this depends on the personalities involved, as some work better on a team than others. Some people are naturally competitive and some are naturally team players, but most can come together if the goal has some meaning to them.

While there is something to be said about the motivation to show the others that you are the best, I believe more quality can be achieved by working together. Each member of a team is able to use their strengths to the team's advatage and not burn themselves out trying to be the best. In a team there are often a variety of skillsets and points of view that can come together and create something no one member could have done alone.
