Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others?

To answer this question, we must first define "happiness".  Happiness can be defined as a sense of well-being or contentment.  While happiness is typically accompanied by feelings of peace and satisfaction, the actual cause of happiness is the absence of anxiety and worry.  When inspected deeply, we realize that happiness is not something to acquire, but rather something to allow.  Happiness is our natural state, and will arise naturally when negative emotions are absent.

To get into a state that allows happiness to arise, we must find ourselves in a state where our self is not threatened.  One way to do this is to manage all external threats by actively taking steps to mitigate them.  This requires the individual to focus on their personal goals since the primary objective is protection of the self.  The individual is constantly on the lookout for danger, and constantly making adjustment to their environment in order to create the appropriate conditions for happiness.  While this method is effective, it requires constant effort, and may be seen as the "white-knuckle" method of achieving happiness.  

A more natural, organic approach is to get into the state where our self is less prominent.  If the self is seen for what it really is - a dynamic undulation of thoughts arising in the mind - a realization occurs that there is no actual entity that can be harmed.  The self is nothing more than a thought.  This realization entirely undermines any threats to self (how can you harm a thought?) and allows happiness to naturally arise.  In conjunction with this realization comes a focus on the happiness of others.  This focus requires no effort or sacrifice, since it is now clearly seen that we are safe and need no attention.  At this point, there is nothing left to do but maximize the happiness of others.
