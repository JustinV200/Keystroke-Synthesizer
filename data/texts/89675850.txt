In this modern world people become more addicted to appearance than the reality. Then the reality becomes the appearance and than their abilities. Because we all are not giving important to the abilities now a days. Media made peoples fall for apperance thing than the good one. This was also made everyone with the wrong perspective.
 
 It also applicable for the influencers and celebrities. We all are blindly trust them with their appearance than the reality. We have to decide give important features more than the ability. It will make people to select everything blindly in the concept of appearance. Appearances are the good thing but that is not important than the reality. The media and advertisment make us to select the thing look good they not give us a real one.

People will fall the trap of appearance in this modern world and this generation childrens also give more priorities to the appearance. This is not good for their career and future. We have to raised them to give importance to the abilities and reality. Because this will make the world good and qulaity one. So I prefer the ability and talent than the appearance of the things or product or the person.
