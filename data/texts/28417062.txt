Everything around us is not real. There is a famous quote called don't judge a book by its cover.And yes it's true .we can see many advertisements in television ,radio but they are not real as they,they create particular impact but it has nothing to do with the product .they are just for the sake of advertisement.they are to promote to comsumer but will not assure about the particular product.The product's outer cover will be colourfull and attractive sometimes larger than the content that is inside it.

The appearance of outer surface would be attractive but the content inside will be of low quality. In media some popular people will look so brilliant .but in reality they will be so dump.Our thinking about the particular thing is more important than the appearance. Everything around us isn't genuine.There is a well known expression called don't pass judgment on a book by its cover ,And yes it's true .

We can see numerous promotions in tv,radio yet they are not genuine as they. they make specific effect yet it doesn't have anything to do with the product.they are only for commercial.they are to elevate items to buyers however won't guarantee about the specific product.The item's external cover will be colourfull and appealing once in a while bigger than the substance that is inside it.
