I feel that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals. I feel one would get more satisfaction from obtaining any goal they may have had planned. Personally, finishing any task from start to finish makes me fell accomplished!

Although, happiness does come from within as well. Definitely accomplishing your goals in life will surely help maintain your happiness. Some look to others to make them happy but you can not make everyone happy. There will always be something that doesn't satisfy someone. We as people have different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Whats good for one may not be good for another!

Somtimes it takes some soul searching to find out what truly makes you happy. Once you do then you start taking  the neccasary steps to make that happen. Take baby steps and you will get there. We all have one life to live so live it to the fulliest! At the end of the day it's your life to live. Your life will be more forfilling when you do whats best for you and accomplish what you want to accomplish. Rather thats going to college or being a stay at home parent. Shoot for the Moon!
