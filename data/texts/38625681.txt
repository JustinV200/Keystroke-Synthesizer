Is what we see really what we get? How swayed are we by glossy ads and curated social media personas. Our perceptions can become our reality.  We see what "they" want us to see. The media can present things in a way that is not necessarily the truth.  We can fall prey to "style over substance".  Images and impressions can have a very strong effect on the consumer. This is not by accident, and is often quite deliberate. 

There are professions devoted soley to creating the best "image" or presentation to present to the world.  From advertising executives, to marketing professionals, to public relations firms, the idea is to present things in the best way possible.  Products are marketed to the consumer with clever, eye catching advertisements, that may or may not give all the relevant information about that product.  Stores spend a great deal of time deciding where to stock certain products to increase sales.  Public figures carefuly curate their public image to present themselves in the best light, with the help of publicists and social media managers.  All of this is to create an image to sway the consumer. 

While the impact of presented images and impressions can have a strong impact on one's perception of items of persons, knowledge of how we are influenced can help alleviate that impact.  If one is aware of the "tricks of the trade" one may be better able to compact that impact, and make more thoughtful judgements about what actually is being presented. It is important to stay informed and aware of these marketing gimicks.
