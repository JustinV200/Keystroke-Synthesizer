obviously, people cannot go interior to any ones life to see their personal issues or reality. People belive of what they are seeing outside. there was an lot of fans for public figures and  politicians too. out of 100% , 95% of people will blindly belive the advertisement . they use to follow the products of which they popular ones are prescribing in the media.
similarly, people in stores "the ratings and quality" checking of the package is very low. people will get attracted by the outer appearence of the cover packed and will choose the product for their use. The package will be decorated in attractive manner or the photo of the public figure may be pasted in front of the packet.
The public figures duty is to promote the product and get payment for the advertisement . they only tends to attract the people not deeply shows about the product. similary, politicians duty is to elaborate his political party among people. by offering some things. so, that they may offer a lot of things to people.
out of 100% only 5% of people will think and purchase the product and will not get attracted by any public figures  and do not accept any offers from politicians.
finally, purpose of clear advertisement is to get attract the people. not any reality is showing out. Media is spoiling the peoples mind.  my decision is people must think and realise what is reality. because, reality is the one which will remain constant.
dont get attracted by outer appearence "Dont judge a book by its cover"
