Images and appearance does have too much of an effect on people.  This is an image-driven society without much concern about the authenticity of a product or person.  For instance, as in some music artists, they have no musical talent whatsoever, but because they may be very attractive that alone would guarantee them a celebrity status.  

As for some products, because the outside of packaging may be appealing it is assumed that the contents of the package may be of quality.  Just like in products, people who may not be that talented or intelligent can package themselves to appear a certain way to garner the attention of whom they are trying to impress, and may succeed in obtaining whatever it is that they are trying to obtain by looks alone.  

I find this to be very unfortunate because there are quality products that may not be ideally packaged but nonetheless of more quality than an attractively packaged product.  Most people are very superficial and will continue to be swayed by the external rather than internal if not taking a more logical and reasonable approach to their purchasing decisions.  Outward impressions has a tremendous effect on people but we have to use logic approaches in obtaining our products.  My thoughts on that would be to take a different approach to the products that we come across not knowing the quality of the contents in that package and set out to research more about that product before making a decision in purchasing it and in that way we will have better outcomes in our purchasing decisions.
