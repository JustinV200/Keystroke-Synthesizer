Sometimes happiness comes from an unknown person if you see happiness in others.The happiness is everywhere so you should be happy in your own or other creates to be happy.                      



                                    But if you have your personal goals you will have the capability to make everyone happy it you gain the confidence of completing your personal goals that confidence will take you to the happiness of others also. Commonly peoples  likely to be happy with their personal goals nowadays like buying them a new car, Furniture, Home and other expensive and luxaryitems etc. They are having a mentality that their assets will bring happiness more people are thinking in that way i think.    



                                       If some one makes the others happy they may be not so rich may be not having luxary things but they always remain the same in every situation but the others who depending on their personal goals may not having the same mentality as always they are they may feel discomfort when they lose thier assets sometimes so in point of view focusing on the personal goals is a little risky. But most of the peoples are happy with their own personal goals. Happiness is equal to a all kind of people.
