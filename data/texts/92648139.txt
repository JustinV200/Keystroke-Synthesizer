First impressions is extremely important in our society. Especially with the advent of social media, impressions  are becoming more and more important to keep customers and people in general motivated. Whether it is food, athlete, or an app, we desire something that stands out and triggers our emotion. Many times though, this does not translate to the quality of the product. 

One thing we find in the grocery store that relates to this is cereal. Kids want that boxed cereal with Tony the Tiger or the toucan on the Fruit Loops box. We grew up buying these types of cereals and if someone offered one of the large bagged cereals that mainly have the same ingredients, we would reject it. Are the boxed cereals really that much better? Or do we gravitate towards the characters that we grew up with where the boxes were filled with bold colors and an exciting personality. 

Another area where images and impressions have a strong effect is the enterainment business. If you look at most artists, they are fit, beautiful, or "sexually desirable." Most of the people winning reality shows in singing or dancing are easy on the eyes and not necessarily the best talent. And if they are not attractive, there is typically something endearing about them. Of course there are outliers and many who become stars because of their skillset. One person that comes to mind is Ed Sheeran. He is unconventional looking but his talents have taken him far.

Despite the fact that imagery and impressions are important, there are many instances where a product is of good substance despite not being flashy. Those are the ones we should look out for and not get caught up in all the flash and glamour.
