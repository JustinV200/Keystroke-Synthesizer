 
      The topic say about people's happiness based on their believes by pursuing their dreams and their personal goals. And some other believe that people are happy when they have their minds fixed on some goal other than their own happiness.

    The main claim of the topic is about people happiness based on their believes. I think happiness is based on their own thoughts and focusing on their own goals and not by focusing the happiness of others.

    In my own life i could realize happiness based on my own thoughts and ran towards to achieve my goals in my life. Other people happiness also based on their own thoughts and not by focusing on other people happiness and their life styles.

     What the writer or author sayed in the prompt was not true. Because i see many people in the society don't have a time to focusing on other's happiness. They only can get happiness when they focusing on theri own personal goals. Only when they acheive their goals in their personal life they automatically get happiness.

    As a conclusion whenever people fix their life goals and run towards to achieve their goals finally get happiness in their entire life. If they focusiong on other people happiness they cannot achieve their own goals and never get happiness in their entire life.
