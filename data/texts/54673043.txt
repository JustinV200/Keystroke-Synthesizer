        I do not know anyone, who does not want to be a successful member of society. So why are there both productive and non-productive people in the world? Many people might agree that, accomplishments play a vital role in the success of a person's life. In contrast, failure woule be a lack of achievement. So do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?
       Competition is the activity betwen two or more individuals competing for a common reward. Cooperation is the activity of two or more individuals working together for a common end result. To compete one on one could create many negative outcomes because one person is the winner and the other is the loser. However, cooperation brings individuals together as one team.
