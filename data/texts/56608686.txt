I think images and impressions both have too much of an effect on people in many different aspects of our lives. People have a tendency to make judgements and decisions based off of what they see sometimes without researching out the facts to find out if the images and impressions are correct. As an example I use to work at a convenience store  a long time ago and I had a knack for getting to know my regular customers, either personally or hearing information from someone else who either knew them or of them. There use to be a baglady that would often come inside to use the bathroom or wash up a little or just to get something to eat and/or drink. I always thought based on how she looked that she was poor and homeless. One day I said something to my boss about how I felt so bad for her and that she seem so sweet that I wished someone would help her so she didnt have to live on the streets. I about fell over when my boss told me that the lady was actually rich and really didnt have to live out on the street if she didnt want to. I guess she was once a thriving member of our community until she had a string of tragedies happen in her life. First she had lost her husband to a heart attack. Then within 5 years after that she lost her only child in an airplane crash. She had a mental breakdown and just never recovered. So this woman chose to live this homeless baglady lifestyle when she could have bought 3 or 4 houses in a rich neighborhood. 
    Unfortunately there are people or things that do live up to their images and the impressions that people get off of them or their situation. These are usually the ones you have to worry about but they are not as common as most think.
    In conclusion the one thing that I always remember my parents teaching me when growing up was to never judge a book by its cover
