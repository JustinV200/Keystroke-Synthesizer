Cooperation vs competition. They are both very important in achieving success whether in business, sports, everyday life. 
Competition seems like it would bring you more success than cooperation. When we compete and compare ourselves to others, we can learn how to improve our current successes. But competition can also be detrimental, as it can harm a person's confidence in themselves and cause doubt and hostility towards others. 
I believe, cooperation is the true key to success. In order for a team to be successful and win a championship you need players that trust and cooperate with each other. Learning to work with others towards a common goal helps foster social and communication skills and builds trust within team members. Cooperating with others helps in gaining other perspectives and allows you to have a more open mind. Cooperation breeds competition because as you are working towards a common goal you are still trying to compete with someone, whether that be a business, team or another work group.
Overall, most people are driven to compete over cooperating. The happiness that you get from winning a competition, is usually short lived and unproductive. We as a society would be stronger, healthier, and financially better off if we chose cooperation first, even though competition seems like the better option.
