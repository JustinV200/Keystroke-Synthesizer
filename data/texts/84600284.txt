Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?
In my opinion, I think you should get to know the person before judging someone. The quote " never judge a book by its cover" stands for never judging someone by their looks, instead getting to know someone and learning their personality and learning who they are.  Poeple often judge others based on their first impression of someone.

I dont think it has affect on people regardless of what they look like or not. Images or impressions of people or products dont mean nothing. Images or impressions, can mean your a good person with a bad attitude or a bad person with a good attitude. Images and products, work the same way. I will stil buy a product at the store,regarless if it has something bad about it i like the said product.  The images of a product will not change how i feel about it. My images of a person are if your nice to me then I wont change how I treat you, if you treat me bad then I will change how things go between us. Many people see different views of different things.

In conclusion, finding what you like and what you dont like, shouldnt be how you go about doing certain things. Products are just name brand things, they shouldnt have an effect on people. The only images that probably would have an effect on people is politics, it always starts an argument with the other party, it shouldnt be brought up. What is your opinion on one  party might not be their opinion on said party. Keep politics to yourself. Everyone has their own opinion on different make up brands, what works for one person might not work for another.
