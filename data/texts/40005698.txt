Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? Can we as humans put things on a pedestool and idolize everything we touch? I believe this answers itself in thousands of millions of ways but for the purposes of this writing task ill name just a few.

Sports illustrated is a very popular mens magazine for one reason only. It sexualizes women in colorful bikini's and men fawn over these photos like they know the women personally. They have no clue most of it is fake. Or they dont care and they do know its fake. I dont know if this is too much of an effect though. Most men look at it for fun- pleasure, a getaway. 

In scripture of the old testament, people worshipped a golden calf and told this was the way to heaven. They were advertised to by the kings an pharos and held in high esteem with their supposed god. We know this was a lie and the moral was NOT to do this but even before this, moses went up on a mountain to talk to god and comes back to his people worshipping a gold idol. It doesnt take long for people to make things bigger in their minds. These people gave up everything to be in the desert with the sun beating down.

Alot of people shop on wish.com and expect exactly what they see in the picture. They want the crisp picture to jump right out of the screen and onto their lap. Most of the time what the see and what they actually recieve are two durastically different things. We tell ourselves we deserve whats in that picture. Human nature? Probably

The thing is, we are very visual creatures. We have the worlds finest camera built in as a major guiding sense. Saying are we affected too much is really redundant if you think about it. Why else to we have these abilities in the first place? 

I think, in the end, images and impressions do exactly what they are meant to do- have too much of an effect. This is the purpose of all of it. One huge propaganda churning machine and it doesnt work unless YOU look at it.
