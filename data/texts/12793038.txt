I believe that some people achieve more success by cooperation and others acieve more success by comeptition.  I think it depends to a great deal on the person in question's personality type.  I think that extroverts generally do better in competitive situations and introverts do better in cooperative scenarios.  I think that this is not always a hard and fast rule because it can be influenced by what the end goal is that is being worked towards and also the type of society a person is raised and living in.

I think extroverts are more likely to be motivated by and inspired by situations which involve social stimulation.  Therefore, competition is more like to inspire them to achieve success. They are better at thriving in chaos and can better handle negative social feedback.  They see themselves as actively participating and being "winners."

I think that introverts, myself included, are more likely to be successful when being colloaborative.  Introverts are more sensitive types, I believe, and do better in a supportive environment.  Competition tends to make the introvert fearful and risk averse and possibly rebel against what is being asked of them.  It brings out the worst in introverts, in my personal experience.

Again, I do believe that there are exceptions and that I am painting with a broad brush.  But, I also believe there is not a "one size fits all" answer to this question.  This is my take as a middle aged woman who has achieved no successes in her life.  I have, however, spent decades in therapy and I am a keen observer of people, so these things also inform my opinion.
