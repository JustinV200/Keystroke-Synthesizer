People promote competition as the only way to achieve success but not all people are thinking like this .Some people encourages the power of cooperation , cooperation helps people to avoid failure and helps people work together  which makes people get success .
According to my point of view,i support cooperation more than competition but both are encouraging people to get success in a different ways.Competition makes two people compare with each other and get the work done quickly .Competition create a rift between two persons in working but cooperation leads a good relationship between  two persons and they perform the task with the help of each other and do the work faster and  achieve success in a supportive manner not only two persons ,a group of persons perform a single work means they share and divide the work with eachother and complete the work faster.
According to my point of view both cooperation and competition gives success but cooperation gives a group of people working together and get success but competition gives only one person success .so i think cooperation is better than competition in achieving sucess most of them are also encouraging cooperation with team work and maintain good friendship and get success in their work .
