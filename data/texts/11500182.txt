  Yes, I think that false visions on good images is all the people do the mistakes Iclearly fall for that lets set an example i really fond an star who is very hertly to my mind and soul i really like him very much i literally take him as my role model . My life depends on so much of his publc figure.
 How much i loved him he is a good believer and good star and good husband and good father to his babies. You know the feeling if u wank to be a that person yes it is . He is like that on my every second i want to be that good.
 But the reality is very cruel it turns out to be an addict and who abuses his family but all those are just images spit my her company Iam so disappointed and heartbroken after hearing that.
 You know if u trust something but it turns out to wrong how much painful it is.I clearly felt that.so i think yes, the images and impressions have too much of an effect on people and am i one who is clear victim i want to clear that vision from myself very badly.
