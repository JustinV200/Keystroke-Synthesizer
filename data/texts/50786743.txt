     I strongly believe that we as humans will achieve more by cooperation insteasd of competition. Because when we are in competition with one another, we attend to out do each other. Like the prahse "Keeping up with the Jones's" But coopperation is throwing yourself out there, trying to make something of yourself, by raising your hand when someone else does not want to participate, you take one for team so to speak. 

Don't get me wrong competition is a good thing but it can also be a bad thing, like in sports you have thousands of competitions, some children get upset or mad when they don't win. Instead of imbracing the loss and wishing the other team a good job, they get angry instead of congratulading. 

        This goes for Adults as well, we attend to act like children when it comes to competition or trying to out do each other. 
As adults we should cooperate with one another and come up with a simple solution instead of makeing it a competition, because if you win all the time, then that will go to your head, makeing you feel like your at the top and everybody else is at the bottom.
