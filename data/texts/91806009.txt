              Competition and cooperation are not opposites. Competition is necessary for cooperation to even exist.You have been trained to think that competition and cooperation are opposites but a few seconds of thought show that this is not true.

              competition exist whenever alternatives are compared. Competitionis,in the simplest and broadest terms a, comparision. whenever a choice is made, a comparision must be made among alternatives. Those alternatives are in competition with one another. When you make a choice, one of these alternatives"Win" the competition among these alternatives.

               Before cooperation takes place, you must decide who to cooperation with and how to cooperate with them. You cannot cooperates with anyone in every imaginable way. So you choose by co,p[aring among competing alternatives.Until you make that choice , no cooperation is possible.

                The real opposite of competition is no alternatives, a single choice without any competition. When there is no choice, there is no competition, but there is also no cooperation. If you have no choice
, there is only compulsion, slavery. The term cooperation implies you have a choice.

              To the present generations, cooperation to get rich does make you feel better than competition, but for the future generations, the result is the same resources exhaustionand environment destruction that lead to thier extincion.

               Actually when the future generation know how we did this, they will be more angry with us, our ancestors cooperated to make us extinct
