Materialism: A necessary part of capitalism or just plain greed?

Materialism gets a bad rap in our society. That is to say, the word itself has a negative connotation.  Our society is a rewards based society.  We work hard, we earn money, we earn the priviledge to reward ourselves.   Are there those among us who are over-consumers... people who always need the newest cell phone or the biggest TV?  Yes.  While I do not consider myself one of those people, the purchasing goods drives our economy, keeps citizens employed, puts a smile on our faces.  

We cannot in one breathe condemn materialism and then complain about the economy slowing or demand dropping.  No materialism = slowing economy.  Of course, the downside of very high demand is inflation, but that is a small price to pay for low unemployment.   Our economic model may not be perfect, but I prefer a rewards based society over other potential options.  

Materialism is not without its negative consequences.  The need for more and more possessions can lead to dissatisfaction in one's life,  It can lead to jealously and hatred towards those who are percieved as having more than you.  And, taken to it's most extreme, can lead to crime.   But, we have to take the chalk with the cheese.   Materialism makes the world go 'round.
