There are many ways to achieve success. Cooperation and competition are among the ways to achieve success. Both the ways are needed to achieve success most of the time. However one way helps to achieve success faster than the other. Through competion success can be achieved better. 
Effort to become succesful is increased through competion. People struggle harder to achieve success when people are around them. they always want to get more succeeded then the others. Competition only helps them to beat others. So, people put more effort and achieve success. People cannot work as hard as being competitive in being cooperative. They tend to adjust with others and also will sacrifice their goals inorder to cooeprate with others. Cooperation is neccessary but to achieve success, cooperation alone cannot help, competition is needed to achieve success. Competition helps to bring out the best abilities of people. 
Success can be achieved differently, but competition helps to achieve success more quick and easily than othes. Competition makes the people realise the struggle in achieving success and helps them fight  for it with courage and better understanding. Cooperation makes the people waste time by fooling around and adjusting with people around them so the work cannot be done easily. But competition uses their effort to make works done easily and quickly.
