Happiness, and one's view on how to achieve it means something different to many people. One person might believe they will be happy once they earn a certain amount of money, while another person finds happiness in donating, or volunteering. 

I believe more people would be happy if they focused on the happiness of others and improving humanity. I am the first person to admit that I always say I will be happy when I achieve a specific goal, but focusing inward only leaves room for self-criticism. For instance, let's say I am working towards a promotion and don't receive it, or aiming to get an A in my class but get a C, now I am more unhappy than I orignally was and will likely focus on the bad grade that I received. If I had got the promotion or the A in my class, I will likely need a new goal to achieve to be happy again. When I focus on other helping others people or doing something to improve society I feel more fulfilled and less likely to concentrate on my problems. 

While it is important to have goals and work towards improving your life, I believe happiness is easier to achieve while focusing outward and helping others. It is inevitable to feel good when you are helping someone in need or contributing towards improving their life.
