Nowadays it might appear to some that folks are overly concerned with increasing their possessions, from acquiring the latest smartphone to purchasing the newest electric car. The question becomes does this desire in any way negatively affect the overall health of our society? I'd like to believe, that in the end, one's quest to reap the rewards of one's success through material possessions ultimately benefits society.

The desire for that upgraded phone or that house with an extra bedroom fosters a surge in one's motivation to work harder, smarter, and longer. Looking at what this translates to can be defined by myriad upsides. Consider the well being of an individual who sets a goal and achieves it and thus rewards themself with something important to them. From a macro view, think of the increased productivity this mindset brings to the economy at large - greater productivity equals more profitability equals more opportunity for growth in employment, not to mention more product/service demand helping to maintain a robust economy.

Some may say that materialism leads to an untoward shift in priorities. "There are more important issues in play than buying the latest and greatest." There is merit to that claim. I would ask though to consider that with material success comes the possibility of altruistic actions. Those striving for more goods and who are successful very well may have more disposable income to positively affect worthy causes, i.e. charitable donations and volunteering.

My sense is the best outcome is reached with a strong sense of balance.  The thought of materialism as one's sole mission is anathema, both for the individual and society as a whole. Accomplishment and regard for others married to material gain is a match worth evaluating.
