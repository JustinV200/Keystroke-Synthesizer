The reason behind my hatred towards the materialism life are 
it causes anxiety,it drives us away from spiritual path,it leads to jealously,it stresses our mind and so on.
if we keenly observe,these sufferings are the result of materialism,it is pointless because we are spirit soul with a material body.As soul ,we have nothing to do with this material world.i think non materialistic peple have learnt the true meaning of happiness.They take their contentment from the natural world and find great joy in nature,personal relationships nad spiritual beliefs.They are content with the bare necessories for life.These peoplse are very rare and are not ego driven.
In my opinion,the major cause of materialism is a lack or dearth of materials.To understand,what could be a major cause.There are many different grades of materialism,both gross and subtle.Even  a person living a very simple life in a very rural environment.Yeah materialism is not the best trait as humans have.But lovefor some things is acceptable.If by materialistic you been something to do with wealth,there will never  be enough for a truly materialistic person.Once we got failed many times in the hunt for materialistic desires,if we are not worried of the result of our effort we can easily get out of the chaos.
