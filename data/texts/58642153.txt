we all live in a world were the people and personalities anr valued in the way where they only see their facce or money to value them we are nowadays valued based on our money we must learn to value people not based on their money or appearence but on their character we must understand the value of character in a person.

we must accept that first impression is a must and  but the impression must not be because of their appearence or money but because of their character, we all must learn to respect people with their abilities and character we all must be greastful to those people who treat us good by anymeans we have to get a lot of friends who dont care about money but true friendship  appearence is often always to far from reality any can look good if they want but having a great character is not easy and finding people with good character is too difficult these days people value everyone by their money and they are not greatful to anything  all they care about is money this has to change in everyone .

we all must learn to accept people by thier character and not by their appearence appearance is always misleading.
