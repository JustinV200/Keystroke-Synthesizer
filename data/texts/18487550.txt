Materialism in modern society, how do you fare? Materialism may be considered a bad thing to some but others may not agree. Admittedly most people now-a-days would'nt consider their daily spending as materilism or being materialistic. I would venture to guess most people when asked would'nt consider thier daily spending as materialism but when looked at closley it may just that.

If we take into consideration someones daily consumption and consider today's ease of access, for items we "need" we will fall into a materilistic category. You wake up to the alarm clock that does more than just wake you up at certain time, it speaks to you, charges your devices and tells you your a fantastic person. Insead of a analog clock with alarm function that is a fraction of the cost. You watch the news on the latest and greatest smart tv and check your morning emails on your device that doubles as a mobile office, calendar and even makes phone calls. One of your prized possessions next to the wrist "watch" that does the exact same thing. On the way to work you stop and get a coffee that costs 3 - 5 times more than an at home brewed cup but it doesn't matter because you have the famous brand name coffee. 

These purchases or consumption extend throughout the day everyday of the week however, some may argue that those things are needed, tools for a productive career in today's modern world. Some of these tools help advance my workflow, maintain my appointments or keep them going throughout the day. This may be true, but are there other ways to obatin these things without being so attached to devices, designer foods and drink? Redirecting some of that time and energy away from spending or conforming to regimens may draw us back from a materialistic society.
