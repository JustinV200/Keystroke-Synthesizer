  I don't think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.  In the world today, there seems to be a lot of materialism going on.  It just so happens to be a part of everyday life.
   You look at the world around you in this day and time and see that most everything isn't free.  Most people basically have to work two jobs to even make ends meet.  It is difficult for just one person in a family of say three to only be working.
   In some ways, being materialistic can bring you happiness, but only for a short time, it's temporary happiness.   Say, for example, you have a family that's struggling for some time, can't find work or not getting paid enough.  They have to live with family because they can't afford to live in their own house.  For this family, being able to provide and afford to buy a home would bring them happiness.  Or just having enough money to get by in life, and I'm not saying being greedy or anything like that.  You could have all the money in the world and still not be happy, it depends on how you manage it and not let it control you.  Yes, most people spend a lot of time and energy creating and buying more materialistic things, and a lot of that is from trying to make a living and trying to survive in this world.  It has gotten crazy lately, prices of things going up, such as the cost of gas, groceries, etc.  not to mention shortages of different items in stores, essential items at that.  All in all, I don't believe there should be any criticizing going on because we all are trying to just get by and provide for our families as best we can.  There also has to be a balance though, you can't let materialistic possesions have control over your life.  You have to know what's more important to you, such as your family.  In any thing you do, there has to be boundaries and make sacrifices.
