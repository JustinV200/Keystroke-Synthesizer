I personally believe that the power of cooperation is much more useful when it comes to achieving success, no matter what it is that you're trying to achieve.  In this essay I'm going to explain to you my reasoning behind this theory and what personal experiences I've gone through that have shaped my opinion on this matter.

I grew up around a brother who was one of the most competetive people that I've ever met.  He displayed a ton of qualities that showed me how arrogant people who are competing against each other can be.  When people are constantly striving to be better than other people it only leads to an inflated ego and an even more pronounced sense of separation from other people.  However, when you work cooperatively as a team towards a similar goal, you can achieve so much more than you ever could have alone.

This is why the power of cooperation is a lot more productive and useful in society today.  If we could all work towards a sense of unity consciousness, where none of us are separate, no one is better than anyone else, and we all had good intentions for each other, we could go so much higher than anyone would ever be able to go on their own.  That is the whole point of being on this planet, is to learn how to work together to build, to create, to grow...and eventually achieve the sense of oneness that we have all been working towards for centuries.

When we divide, and try to conquer others, we are working against each other and destroying any progress that we've made towards world peace.  If everyone was treated equally and fairly, and the illusion of separation was no longer there, we would be living in a much better and more productive world.  It could be beautiful.
