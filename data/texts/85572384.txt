     It is true that we encounter things in our daily life that convince us that was we are seeing is not in fact truthful. We are bombarded by advertisements for beauty products that make us believe that if we use them we will be attractive. We see ads for products that make us look cool or important. Automotive ads are just one example of this. Advertisers use anything that they think will convince us their product will make us cool or have status.

     Celebrities are very often used to endorse products. Advertisers rely on a celebrities larger than life persona to convince us that we must have this or that product to have a status in society. When in fact these celebrities most likely don't even use the product they are pushing. They count on peoples own insecurities to encourage them to buy or use a product to give us the appearance of something akin to being a celebrity.

     Self image starts with ourselves and how we see ourselves. Parents need to teach children that they must have confidence and self worth that doesn't come from what others think.  Teach our children by example and not buy into the flashy ads we are exposed to on a daily basis. This is how we change the atmosphere of "because I'm a celebrity or politician, I can do what I want". People need to learn to think more for themselves and rely less on what others tell them.

     Politicians are more concerned with themselves and their agendas, not what their constituents that elected them want and as long as we continue to allow this we will never prosper as a country.
