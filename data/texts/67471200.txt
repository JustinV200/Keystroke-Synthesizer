Sitting here in my office, I can see the many Lego minifgures that I have aquired in my life. Whenever I see them I reminisce about various times of my life and it brings me joy to think about how they have been connnected to my life. I would not have these reminders if I did not purchase them throughout my time. I feel that my generation is often ciriticize, rather unfairly at times, for our need to have material things or want possessions. Life is hard enough and the deck is very much stacked against the younger generations and if we need something to help us live, then why not.

Consider all things that are going on in the world ie., global warming, inflation, recession, social issue regressions, jobs with terrible pay, student debt, pandemic, gun violence the list goes on and on. With all these things placed on the shoulders of us the need to focus on materialistic things that bring us joy and distract us is not difficult to understand. Our need to try and find hapiness in the world is a human need. We do not find it much in life as we know it, so finding it in material things is the only way we can control where, when, and how we can bring that happiness in our lives. If someone is having a terrible day and they find some peace in buying a video game or Lego, then who am I to judge them?

In short, modern society has a variety of issues to deal with and our focus on materials allows us to find happiness that is tough to get in the real world. No one should be judged for trying to find their happiness even if they find it in something as simple as a Lego set.
