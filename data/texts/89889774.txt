In today's society, it is apparent that images and impressions have a big effect on people. Most of what is seen on social media concerning images and impressions are negative and many individuals cannot decipher what is real from what is fake. I think it is safe to say that many don't care.  Not only that, social media places many indiviuals in positions where they become competetive or they completely disreagard that there is a time and a place for certain things and/or discussions. 

Moreover, images and impressions encourges many people daily. For instance, there are many celebrites who hide who they really are. They hide behind the images they post, appearing to be someone that they are not. These tyes of celebrities get so much attention and many indiviudals crave this type of attention, even if it is negative. 

In conclusion, while images and impressions can have too much of an effect on people, it can also create a positive change. I believe change starts with an indivual. If more individuals wanted to create a positive change, they should start with the fact that images and impressions does not always have to be negative and that it's okay to be a leader not a follower.
