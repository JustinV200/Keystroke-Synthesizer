People basically think of  outlook instead of  capabilities and ability.
Now a day's people leaving only on overlook instead of their interior qualify and quantity colorful outlook increases the promotion in the same way people also getting recognised by their dresssing and look instead of their abilities.
In a store basically thething's which look colourfull to people will get rare affected when compared to the other items which are normal. So people should be aware of quality and quantity of product instead of colour and outlook.
In the same way peoiple also getting identified with their outlook and dressing styles but not depending upon their abilities and capabilities. I sujjest that everyone should look quality and qualntity of product or person to know about their individual features. People should be identified with their work and abilities instead oif their outlook so everyone can be treated in the same way. Because of personal abilities the capabilities depends every person will not have the same abilities and talents. Every individual has different talents and capabilities. In the same way products should also been identified with their features and quality specification instead of outlook and their color. So finally appearances differ fromthe reality and reality is the thing every pone should notice.
