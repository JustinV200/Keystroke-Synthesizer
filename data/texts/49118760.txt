If I may ask: what exactly is the essence of living? Is it to amass materials and be respected for their volume, or to MAKE IMPACT? In my opinion, I believe the insatiable desire for material things is exactly the major cause of the global vices. Hence, I am convinced that the modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Some of the reasons for my assertion include shared wealth promotes peace, modest living (less materialism) inhibits unjustified desperation, a society not laced with materialism gives equal opportunity of a shot at glory, amongst others. I would gladly elaborate on all highlighted points in the succeeding paragraphs

First, shared wealth promotes peace in the society in such that a community where everybody can afford and cater for  their daily needs easily without awful stress will experience nothing short of peace and harmony.

Secondly, modest living inhbits unjustified desperation. Similar to the first point explained above, a modern society that is full of individuals without modest spendings due to excessive accumulation of material and money will no doubt become a source of oppression for their fellow neighbors that are not as privileged as they are in one way or the other.  In addition, any society not engulfed by the burden of materialism will definitely avail the citizens equal and unrestricted shot at success in every imaginable sphere of life.
In conclusion, although materialism could be argued to the crucial in this contemporary age, yet, it as clear as the day that it's the pressure that ensued from this that is the bane of the society.
