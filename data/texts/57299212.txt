People achieve more success through competition than through cooperation. While cooperation may be a component of success, it is the competition which drives the success.
Success through competition is most evident in free market economies, where people are driven by a goal to succeed over others. This goal of success is generally defined by economic wealth or social notoriety in free market economies. This is particularly noted in annual rankings of global wealth of individuals, nobel prizes to individuals, and other means of comparison of peoples success.
While there are comparable rankings and awards to companies or other cooperative entities, it is still the individuals in those companies or cooperative entities that are recognized specifically for success. Is it Apple computer or Steve Jobs?
There is a constant push by individuals to build something bigger, or better, or newer- an ongoing competition to achieve something more or different. This individual instinct reinforces the notion that competition is what drives success. As noted, cooperation among individuals may be used to promote this success, but it is still the competition (the idea) that underlies the success.
Another basic example of competition over cooperation is sports. While individual sports is a given, team sports also promote individuals over teams. Most successful teams have and promote superstars, without which they would not achieve success. Yes cooperation, but the success is the competition of the star players. These players are highly paid, they are traded among teams, and in fact, they are part of a team that attributes success to competition among individual coaches, and in turn among individual team owners.
So it seems competition is the true driver of success!
