Life is full of competition .Anywhere we go now a days or work anywhere we found very tough competition throughout the day.But that is not the only way of success in life as others emphasize the power of cooperation.When we compete with ourselves we found more maturity day by day and understanding ablity.Things would more clear day by day.But when we compete with others we could see changing in our daily behavior with that particular person.

Having competition with others makes anyone rivalry at work or anyother department we work.From here we thing not only our faults but to sees other faults, these kind of thoughts makes a person feel think guilty and makes anyone don't see the failure sight and it may people either go towards failure too.So we need to thing twice about do we really need competition in real life, The answer might be no.

In a world of such thing happens already each and everyday with persons like us. we really need to thing about cooperation with each other instead of being rivalry in daily life.In a complex world , cooperation is very important aspect of life and much more likely to produce significant and ever lasting accomplishments. So we need to be positive with each and every persons we met or we spend times in whatever we do throughout the day in a working manner and understanding mannner.
