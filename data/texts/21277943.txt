Happiness is something that every one strives for and every one of us can attain if you follow certain guidleines on the path to happiness. The only way someone can truly be happy is if they follow their own personal goals and dreams. Happiness is internal, not external. No one else can make you happy, you must do it yourself. 

Thorugh out time, people have been striving for happiness and how to live a fufilling life. Reaching for your own dreams and goals is the only way to achieve this. It does not matter if your goals involve others,  as long as they are your own. 

First you must decide what you want out of life and go for it. Even if you fail one time or one hundred times, you will know that you are working towards something that you want and believe in. Happiness will come with striving for these goals.

Next, make sure that every day you do something for yourself that makes you feel good and works towards your goals. Even if you are so busy that you feel like you do not have the time, take 10 minutes to have a nice bath, read a book, or invest time in your goal and you will accomplish something that many people do not. 

There is no way for a person to be happy if they are only living for others because you will be sacrificing your own dreams and goals for them. You can feel fufilled, but you will not be happy. The happiness of others may make you feel happy but true inner peace and happiness can only be attained if the goals are deeply ingrained in your own soul. In short, the happiness of others will never make you truly happy. 

We all want to be happy. We are here for such a short time, there is no reason for us to be sad in this journey. Start today, go out and make yourself happy.
