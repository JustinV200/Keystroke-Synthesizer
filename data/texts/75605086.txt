My opinion in this is one can be happy if they achieve a goal of their wish. They want to get practice to achieve their goal. Each person can have a goal in their life So that everyone can make a successful life. 
Some people have the happiness because of talking to someone who are their dearest one. I have a person who I call him as my sweety. When she is near me I will be the most happiest man in this world. Because she will make me happy at a sudden movement. She helps me all time in getting my goal.
Some have their happiness with their family. They can get help by their family itself. Every member in their family will help them by encouraging his/her. If all of them are in one place that place will become a successful and happiness place. So this way also one can get happiness.
In other place people's friends will place a main role in their life. They will support for their friend for reach their goal in an encouraging way and make happy always. This will be happens to only a few members in this world.
So these are the ways one can be happy always.Everyone can be happy if they get success in their life and focus on their own goal. If they saw others they will lose their happiness. Thank you.
