Life was very easy before few years and the people were happier than today with what they had. There was no urge for going to work and doing other things. But, now everyone's on a urge to do everything and were not able to do the works properly. They can't even able to take care of them properly in this modern world. Getting affected by new kind of diseases and spending money to get recovered from it. In old days, people were more healthier because of their working conditions and food habits.
