People achieve more success through cooperation, than through competition. Though persuasive arguments can me made for both sides, cooperation is ultimately superior because it can result in a Win/Win success that competition rarely yields.

Win/Win is an outcome (or an attitude) that we should all be aiming for, in our work lives, personal lives, and in our lives in general. People get along better when the people around them actually are concerned about their welfare, and on such a paradigm people are more productive and mentally healthy. When we compete with each other, we often leave our compassion and empathy on the sideline, resulting in, typically, a Win/Lose outcome.

Win/Lose is inferior to Win/Win becase the latter benefits both parties. Relationships, sometimes lasting, are built upon Win/Win foundations. Win/Lose ultimately fails also because it produces wins that are ephemeral, that are based upon being better than your opponent; focus like that shies away from concentrating on character-building and integrity.

Cooperation, in most areas of our lives, means that we are expending time and energy to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, to see things from their perspective. It's not as simple or cliche as "Can't we all just get along?"--it's about facing the difficulty of the Social Contract we all enter into, and asking the tough question (so easily avoided with a competition-based attitude), "How can we all get along better?"
