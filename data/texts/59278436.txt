Too oftern are we sold on the next greatest and latest item that is glamorized to us; only to be hit by the crushing disappointment of being mislead by flashy advertisments and paid spokepersons. Many products are sold to us through clever marketing campaigns before we've even had a chance to try them in person. Unfortunately this leads to wasted time and money for many. These strategically placed images and views give us a false impression of what we're actually buying. 

Most people know of the sleazy salesman that will tell you anything you want to hear just to make their next sale. However, few realize that some major businesses incorporate some of those same practics. It's just when large corporation implimates these practices, it is not nearly as obvious. For example, EA Games put out Battlefield 2042, a first person shooter video game, nearly a year ago. It was hyped up through agressive marketing campaigns and paid spokespersons to get players to pre-order it before they've even had a chance to see how well the game functions. The time for the game to be released comes around and players find themselves in possesion of unfinished, buggy, and worthless game they have no desire to play. EA games showed demo gameplay and told players time and time again just how great of a time they'll have playing. But, it was all a bunch of hot air. 

Consumers can too easily be persuaded by flashy marketing campaigns and misleading demos. Even if a company knows that they have an unfinished or defective product they still want to push sales as hard as they can. This way the company can atleast break even. We all must as consumers be more cauitous of the images we are shown through advertisments. They may not be entirely truthful and you might just find yourself burned on your next purchase.
