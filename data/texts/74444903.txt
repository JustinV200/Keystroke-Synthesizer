Modern society should be critized for being so materialistic.  People are spending their energy on trying to have more than the person next door.  The funny thing is, most of us don't even know our neighbors.  So, the question is, who are we really competing against?  Is it really necessary?

What happens when we choose to have more and more?  First of all, we work more and more just to buy things we don't really need.  This takes away from family, personal relaxation time, and time with God.  This teaches our children that they are only second to what we can own for ourselves.  It distances us from our spouses and puts more stress on them to run the household.  Jesus tested people in the Bible to see if they could give up all their material things and follow him.  Some could and some failed to do it.  When we are obsessed with material things, it is considered a type of worship.  Jesus says not to worship anyone or anything but him.  In the old Testament, God perished people that had items they worshipped other than him.  The thing is, God will supply you with all that you need.  

Some people say, I need this new apple television version because my other one is broken.  That sounds like a good argument but do we really need it?  Are the perks of new technology demanding we need it?  Could you be happy with a television that just comes with a remote to operate it?  We have to be accountable.  We have to learn to love what we have because it isn't always promised to have these other modern things.  Then where will we be? 

There is a question I ask my children when they say, "I need this!".  My response is always the same.  "Do you want it, or need it?"  It's comical to watch their faces because they know the answer before they even utter it.  "No, but....."  The lesson here is to not let the desire of ownership of things, to own you.  Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.
