     The fulfillment of the individual is is a question that has occupied the thoughts and writings of humanity for millennia. Is the individual fulfilled by attainment of personal goals, or in the betterment of the human condition in general. I believe the answer to that is both -- that true happiness (the kind with its roots in spiritual reality) can only be achieved when an individual is attempting to achieve a personal goal in line with his or her gifts and talents that has a positive effect on others.
     Each person has been given at birth with a set of characteristics uniquely designed and bestowed by God. That person has been obligated to use them to benefit himself or herself and the greater society at the same time. Not using these gifts and talents results in individual frustration and corporate poverty. Both the individual and society are poorer off for not pursuing dreams and goals in line with how the individual has been divinely gifted.
     I would also argue that the individual pursuing only that which brings him or her happiness is short-sighted, and has proven in the end to bring even greater frustration and sorrow than if never having pursued it at all. In the same vein, if an individual only pursues that which brings happiness to others, he or she will be individually impoverished, and those to whom the actions are directed will receive diminished and half-hearted help.
     An individual's time on earth is very limited. Pursuit of one's dreams and goals with a strong eye for helping others in the process is the only way that anyone can be truly happy.
