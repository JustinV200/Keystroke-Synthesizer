    Here i come to write a essay about to people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition.so as per my knowledge cooperation is always best in cooperation we can built a team and achive our goal with some teamwork and we can geather different ideas from our team and dicuess the merit and demerits then we can make a finial decission.But in competition means we cannot share any thing to any one.
      In competition there is only one he wants to take all the decissions weather its write or wrong he is the one to take all responce but in cooperation there is a team to decissus everything.if there is a single piece of stick means we can easily broke it.In a same time we have bunch of stick togeather means its not easy to broke.Its was a small example for cooperation and competition.
      In cooperation we can built a team and split our work it gives time management also in competition only one wants to do all the work so its makes lot of confussions and no time management also.So here cooperation is always easy to access from anywhere by group of people we have so as per my idea cooperation is always best to work.competition also win in some places but moreover cooperation is best.
                                                               Thank you
