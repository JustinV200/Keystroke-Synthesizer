 To me i believe image and impressions have a lot effect on people because we are always told that first impression last longer in peoples mind and to human the way you place yourself is the same way people will place and react to things you do.
 Image means alot to people and it show how importance and valuable things or people will be reacted to and in many way image help to determind the percentage of trust and confident people will have in a product, establishment or company displayed.
 Many people and company have lost so much trust and comfident due to the image projected by the people and with this has caused alot of damage on the way people will will think and speak of such person or product.
 However so many things should be put into action before you think of putting up an image or impression on people so has to make the impression last longer in peoples heart and good image and impression is the best and valuable thing people will expect more from anythings that will be of good to them and to bring about good recomendation to them.
 So with this point i think and i am sure that image and impressions have too much of  effect on people and the reaction of people toward image will make people knows that the image  shown is not good and not what people expect  and the fact id good things comes from good image and impression people present and while advertising a business one needs to project a better image of a product so as to call so much attention of people and those that have intrest on the item or goods people want to buy, impression means alot when it omes to business orieted, practically from so many intances we have seen so manny growing bussiness has a good image and impression that make people notice them and speak good things about them and make them obvious and making good sale in the market so we need to put up good image for better sales in bussinees and other valuable recomended issues.
