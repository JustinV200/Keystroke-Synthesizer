Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. We are bombarded by marketing and advertisements "to keep up with the Jones". We are forced to stay abreast of the latest version, or latest development in technology or fashion. 
True happiness is not in the posessions I own. I would not have a friend who liked me less because I was not fashionable. And a true friend would not care if I did not own the latest cell phone. Advertising and marketing are turning people into sheep, making them feel inferior if they don't follow. Make more money to spend more money. Buy a big house. You'll be liked more . Buy a fashion hand bag and you'll be admired.
A wealth of intelligence and knowledge is more fulfilling and rewarding than a closet full of clothing. Knowing how to treat another human being is more important than knowing how to power shift the latest sports car. But on the other hand, people who have learned how to make a lot of money to buy a lot of things are successful people. They have learned or earned the right to buy buy buy through their successful endeavors.
In conclusion, I would rather we advertise how to become better human beings. Advertise how to help one another. Advertise how to share knowledge. Market being human beings, not what human beings can buy.
