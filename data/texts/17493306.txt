Materialism is in every aspect of our society, even those that I personally am more in line with that are supposed the represent the antithesis of, i.e. a more socialist socioeconomic system. 

Paying for education in the private sector? That's a material goal. Paying for education through public funding? Also material. Yet, it's not necessarily these things that we think of, or even categorize, when we want to disparage materialism- it's the vanity, the panache, the empty shell of surperfluous things that we wrap ourselves around when we want to give it morality. And I agree. It can be too much.

Too many clothes filling our landfills from the wasteful excess of fast fashion, too many  brands of toothpaste because one has a chemical compound ingredient that might be found in a chemistry lab and the "best" do not; please buy or die. Buy or end up in a dumpster to hopefully, hopefully be scooped up by hobbyists, dumpster divers, trespassers, vagrants, "low-lives", nobodies- nobody. I didn't want my litter to have stripes, I'll just put them in a box, tape it up, and throw it all away, throw the unbeautiful and unfashionable all away. 

I think, we should always be reminded of our flaws, our humanity, and our potential as currently, we may be the last beautiful to be thrown away.
