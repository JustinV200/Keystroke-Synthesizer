Images and impressions sometimes seem to have more effect on our society than substance. Americans are frequently more focused on physical appearance than capability. Sometimes that involves attractiveness and other times it relates to attributes that indicate belonging to a particular group. This seems to be true for people in all walks of society, rich, poor, left, right and any other designation. People only scratch the surface rather than dig for truths.

Celebrities are looked to for their stance on issues when their opinions carry no more validity that than most people you encounter every day. Politicians are elected to office based on things like appearance or charisma rather than expertise or their positions. We look for cues in the most shallow way, failing to dig deeper to determine if who we are idolizing or following deserves our reverence. 

Besides just appearance, there are buzz words words that cause visceral reactions, both positive and negative. Whole groups can be swayed to all sorts of stances by speakers who choose the right catch phrase. People blindly follow these media figures like they are pied pipers without stopping to determine if they are being led astray. They choose a group, a network or a leader and refuse to look outside that box.

Modern society could do with a good lesson in critical thinking. Placing people or institutions on pedestals only leads to errors in judgement.
