most of the time ithink people can get success by cooperation. this is my personal opinion but there have some strong logic about my opinion.
when people try to get success with more people help and with them,then that persona can get more help, even if we do not think about any financial help or techinal help , that person can get atleast mental support and help also.that is too much for getting success.
In this way that person will be happy mood and also he can work for his success witout any kind of pressure.
as much as iknow when human face any kind of pressure , that time people do random and silly misstake . so that the chance of getting success will decrese.

In other side when people on the pressure about oponent that time people do very sily mistake. that is a huge strike to reach in the success .
yeah, there have also some good side about competition . one of them is competetion help to increase the working rate whichisalso somuch important.when people face any kind of competition that time , that person will do more hard work to gain his success. There have no other big reason to support to get success compition.

if we consider all the pros and cons about both of them, most of the chance to get success is cooperation.

N.B. There have various kind of people with various kind of mentality so it is very simple that they can think in diffenrt way. So therr have must have some people who will not agree with me.
