Imagine this, there are two seperate photos. Each has a similar theme. A nice family photo where both the adults and children are cuddled around each other showing love and affection. Both family photos are sporting rifles and handguns in the hands of the family members. Both families like to hunt in their free time and are self defense enthusiasts with matching attire to back that up. However, most people are known to have two competely different views of these photos. The reason? One family is african america and the other is caucasian.
I dont think images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. I think its the total opposite. People have too much of an effect on an image. Even the most simple and pure meaning in a photo could be be twisted if dropped into the right hands. Everyone would have their own view of an image that could be totally different from each other is warped to fit their narrative. They try to convince other people of their personal percieved meaning during that process. People have too much effect on people. A simple convincing arguement could completely change an individuals view on a photo if speaking to the right person. 
Humans are the most influential and effective beings on the planet, which is both good and bad. Unfortuantely that means that our societal impressions is what sociaty is based on and how most everyone operates. A photo will always have the actual same meaning as the creator intended, but it is people that can totally change the narrative of that photo to fit their agenda and in turn creates a huge impression on their fellow man.
