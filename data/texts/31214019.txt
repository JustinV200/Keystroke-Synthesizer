Whether it is at work, school or even sports, achieving success is usually the ultimate goal. How we approach achieving success can be a dynamic topic to consider, but competition rather than cooperation is the most important factor. Though some people might view cooperation as a lasting approach, competition keeps us thriving and, as such, matters most.

Competition allows us to be honest without ourselves about where we currently stand amongst not only our peers, but with those who are more successful than us. This encourages us to set ourselves apart and work harder to achieve higher levels of success. Without competition, there would be no tangible incentive to be innovative and improve our skills. Whether in your work/school environment or in competitive sports, if no one is being compared to anyone else, there is no need to strive for higher levels of success. 

Though cooperation is important especially in team environments, cooperation in and of itself leads to competition anyway. Cooperation is merely an element of competition because in a team setting, having the ability to cooperate makes you more competitive. When you understand that working well with others is an important skill to have to make you more attractive for jobs, schools and sports teams, you ultimately are making yourself more competitive in comparison to individuals who are not cooperative.

While cooperation is a valuable attribute to have, competition is the more important factor when considering levels of success. You are more likely to have meaningful and valuable accomplishments when you consider where stand amongst your peers and evaluate how to distinguish yourself in whatever field you are in. Competition makes you a stronger individual as well as a stronger team member and will allow you achieve your highest level of success possible.
