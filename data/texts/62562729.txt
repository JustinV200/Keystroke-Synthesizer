While people can very well be happy by focusing on other's happiness, I don't think they can achieve a true happiness if they are not taking care of their needs and personal goals.

When a person experiences an achievement they feel a great sense of satisfaction which of course makes them feel happier.
If a personal goal was to build a new backyard oasis by yourself with only a vision in your head and hard work by your hands, how would you feel once it's completed? You'd feel very accomplished, excited, proud and happiness among other things.
You can now go and relax in what you just built whenever you want and each time you look at what you built, that same pride and happiness will come back to you.
Now, say you do the same thing for a family member or close friend. Of course you would feel happiness at the time of building and definitely once you complete it.
But that is one moment.
You won't be able to see it daily, sit in it or admire it as often as if you had done it for yourself. So that happiness is a one off moment. And if you try to gain happiness again by doing something else for someone else, when does it end? How many times do you focus on others before you burnout and don't get to finally focus on yourself?
Focusing on and obtaining your own goals boosts your well- being.  And we all need that, when we feel good emotionally, our bodies feel good physically. And with the world the way it is today, emotional and physical needs are a must to maintain.
You deserve that sense of pride when you accomplish that goal for yourself.
You deserve that pride to come back each and every time you think about what you accomplished! There is nothing wrong with meeting your own needs.
