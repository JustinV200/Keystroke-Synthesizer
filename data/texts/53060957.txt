Modern society should be highly criticized for being materialistic. We all love our designer fashion, jewelry and purses. We love having the latest merchandize from our favorite stores. But, is it really worth it? What value do we bring to our lives by having lots of things and stuff that will eventually go to the dumpsters. Modern society needs to reexamine the cost of producing too much and what effect it has on the environment.

There are many anecdotes of women saying that they have nothing to wear as they stare into their closet full of clothes. They probably have more than enough to cloth them for weeks and months to come. The more we have in our possesion, the more we want and it is an endless cycle. Modern society needs to find a way to shift that frame of mind and think about the consequences of over producing and over consuming. Fast fashion industry is now being criticized for wasting too much unused fabric and other raw goods due to the nature of their manufacturing practice. They have to always come up with new designs, market the product and mass produce in short amounts of time. It is wreaking havoc on the environment as well as the countries that host these manufacturing sites.

Society needs to think globally when it comes to consumption. Every time we are faced with a purchase, we need to say to ourselves, how will this bring value to my life and how is this purchase going to affect others and the environment. Society needs to learn to be content with what they already have and think about the consequences of being materialistic.
