As a young man one of our former presidents, John F. Kennedy, said that his father told him it doesn't matter how you really are as a person to the public you are trying to convince, it is how they perceive you as that person. In other words, it's all about presentation. If you are a deceptive person, the public does not need to know it. Just present yourself as an honest person and that is what is important.

All around us are appearances of what we want or what we want to sell to someone. 
It boils down to persuasion. Of course, the person or people you are trying to persuade must be in a receptive mood for this to be pulled off. However, once this is done the mission has been accomplished.

One can say that people really want the honest to goodness truth and that is what will win in the end. Why should anyone want to deceive others when they will be found out eventually and that will ruin everything simply because that person cannot be trusted from then on out. 

Well, that woudn't really matter would it? The persuader really doesn't care about anyone finding out eventually since once you are sold and have given your permission to be fooled by that deceiver, the persuader, they will move on to the next victim. It's a numbers game. And, it's profitable.
