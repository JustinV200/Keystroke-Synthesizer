      In this task i have an rights to talk independaly. In this paragraph i described the think which peope are more likely to be happy on their goals. Everyone has their own goal. Goal is needed to everyone, one who have a goal he/ she must done with this goal. In their life some people are mostly releaving with their goals.
        In some aspects of people life they suffered a lot, because their life situation.  Poor people are mostly faced this sttruggles.  everyone must have a goal. I also have a goal, my goal is to be run a company and me as a manager of the company, Now a days my dreams comes true. I run a own company and many of the people work as my company, they showed love and happiness to the workers, it is the real happiness of myself. I show the love and carefulness to the workers, like as many people are achieved their goal in this way.
          In their spiritual life we must have two goals like personal goal and goal happiness with others. goal means it comes from our thoughts in our inner mind and the happiness of others means in our happiness we shared with others, like the poor people need food and money is the happiness, once we shared this things to be they happy alot and they happily very much.
