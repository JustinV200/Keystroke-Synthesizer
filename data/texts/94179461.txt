               People are happy when they see others happiness and that will make them very happy but that was not permanant. I see most of the people were happy only because of their family members friends or others. Exambles like If we see our favourite hero in real that made us very happy we can remember the day till our dead. 
              Every one has their own goal. I think If we achieve our goal in our life that will make our self more happy than others happiness. If we see any of our friends or family members achievement that will make us happy but that was not permanant to us. It will end soon but if we achieve our life time goal we can enjoy the moment till our dead. 
              I have one friend he is very attractive, well educated, knowledged and good looking young man and he try to achieve something in his life he focus on his goal very much and he parctices every day. I become happy because of his attitude but that was not permanant to me.  when I achieve my own goal that only makes me very happy. In my opinion people are very happy when they achieve thier own goal that only gives them long time happiness or permanant happiness. happiness of others are really temperary.
