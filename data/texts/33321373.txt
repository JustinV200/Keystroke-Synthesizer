Success can be acheived in two ways namely cooperation and competition, the differences between competition and cooperation is team work. In cooperation there are several peoples working for a success, but in competition people fight each other individually for a success. In my point of view cooperation is the best way to acheive sucess.

First of all let's dicuss about competition, by a competition success can be acheived. We need to work hard to get sucess, in competitions no one will contribute to your victory or success, you need to compete against a person who is also seeking for success too. In sports lets take a running race as an example, everyone is running for their victory individually and so no one will contribute in their victory. In company lets say there will be an hike for only limited person who perform well in this month and now everyone will work for them to get a hike,This is competition.

Now let's discuss about the cooperation, It is a process of getting success by team work. Here some people who is seeking for success join with you and contribute their part for a success this is called as team. For example in sports lets take football, Here eleven players who is seeking for a victory that means sucess contibute their part for our teams victory. They share their skills, intelligence, ideas, patience for their sucess, here people splits into groups namely attackers, defenders, and a goal keeper. Attackers who try to push the ball into opponent team nets. Defenders who try not defend the ball without going into their nets. Goal keepers also a defender who have some more permission to defend a ball. By this team work a success can be acheived more easily. In company if it announces that the best branch of that company will get a hike now people will joint together and work for their success.

By the way cooperation is the best way exist to acheive success. Team work is the best way for cooperation.
