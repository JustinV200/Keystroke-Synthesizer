 "First impression is the best impression" . We all know this very well. First impression created by a person or a first impression we made about a product  is very important . It remain in our memory forever. Impression is a spontaneous image of others formed at the instant, but it will never last forever. 
There is a popular saying that " Never judge a book by it's cover". Actually it is very true. We can't judge a person by how he looks? Most of the well educated people like scientists, philosophers , they don't give much importance to their looks in-stead they concentrate on creative ideas. Most of the good looking people in appearance are not that much good in their heart .They have a fascinating smile, charming appearance but under them lies a cruel mind. If we are attending a job interview it is very important to make a good impression at first sight. People now-a-days make quick judgement about others with minimal information. But after having a conversation or working together the impression can be changed. 
It is our action  not the impression , that reflect our inner thought and decide which category of people we belong to.  Further communication and understanding are very important to understand the true characteristics of a person.
