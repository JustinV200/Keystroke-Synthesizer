Various things, events and occurrences in this world contribute to a person's happiness. This could be a vacation, an unexpected present, a treat for completing a goal, an achievement or just a smile from another person.  Happiness is subjective.  But what makes a person more likely to be happy?  I think happiness is intrinsic, and comes from personal goals. 

Think of when you set out to accomplish something.  There's a plan in place to make it happen.  This accomplishment comes from within you, a desire to achieve something.  You then create a path to achieve it.  This is all based on your wants and needs.  

The second step is actually doing it.  Being reliant on no one else except yourself.  The desire comes from you.  The actions come from you.  Your focus drives you to move and take action.  As you work, you make little "wins" towards the final goal.  This is motivation and encouragement you need to keep going through the good times and bad.   

Finally, when you see that goal in front of you...that finish line is within reach, you use that momentum to complete the goal or task.  This creates the elation within you that grows like a snowball.  When the task is over, you then celebrate the win.  Then you also have the ongoing glory and memory of the hard work you put in.  This will bring a smile to your face for long after the relief of finishing is gone.  You did this, and it was your personal goal that made it happen.
