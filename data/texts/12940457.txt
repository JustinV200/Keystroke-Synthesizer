You may not believe it yet, but cooperation is the cornerstone to our success in life. It would seem that competition is the driving forces behind this, but as will explain the the coming sentences, the true way to achieve the success that we all want is through cooperation.  Let me explain.

The definition of cooperation is "the process of working with each other, for the same goal".  The key element hear is "GOAL".  What are we trying to achieve in the big picture of life?  Happiness?  Unity?  We cannot possibly get there through competition.  Competition makes us all step on one another.  In competition, in order for someone to win, someone has too lose.  In competition, you HAVE to strive to be better than your fellow man, inorder the accomplish YOUR goal, which might be in direct competition of your fellow man.  Yes competition can bring out the best in you, and can put all of us in a more focused state of mind, but at what cost?  The cost of the downfall of your earthly partners, your friends who share this planet.  This is why cooperation is needed.  Let us build all of us up.  Let us accomplish goals that we all want and that benefit us all, TOGETHER.

Yes competition does have a few upsides, but the negative aspects of it will ultimately ruin us all.  Let us use cooperation instead and work together to achieve the greatest prize, UNITY. By doing that, we will prove that cooperation is the best way to go always!
