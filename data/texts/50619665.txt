happiness is really a relative term, some might find that giving other people a reason to smile to be happiness while some other priotize their own happiness. Both of them are within human nature. people can choose whatever they feel to give them happiness, be it improvement of humanity or improvement of ones life both can be counted as a reason to be happy. it can come of different from people to people. people can also find happiness by running towards their goal or helping others reach theirs.

Objectively speaking people will always look for their self interest at their heart, for all people this self interest can be interpreted as happiness, which will deviate from people to people, but people can be much more happier than just by doing what they love to do. It can be helping others or pursuing their own personal goals or anything that makes them want to do it more. Passion and happiness is intertwined in a way, people always like to do what they have a passion for, you can't really expect a medical student too enjoy an IT class if they don't have the passion for it, "if you want to fly before you need wings you need the yearning for the skies". One can easily be happy by simply following their passion, even if it is not a fruitful or successful one, they can still be happy.

so in conclusion all we can answer this question: "are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or the happiness of others?", the answer is neither and both. if some one likes to help people while pursuing their own goals and still be happy about it i would say he is leading a happy life, and vice versa if people want neither to help people or follow personal goals and still stay happy, he too is leading a happy life, it might be a bit less of a moral decision but at the end of the day both of them are happy, and thats all that matters for people to lead a happy life.
