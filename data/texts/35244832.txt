As time goes on and men and women become more and more dependent on technology to assist us in our way of life, our critical thinking skills become more put by the wayside. Information, products, and services are so easily at our fingertips that it's not even necessary to develop essential skills to complete these tasks by ourselves. In this sense, marketing and advertisement has learned to take advantage of the short attention span that we as a culture have developed. Public perception has become more important than truth and reality. 

Oftentimes in order to sell a product, its not as important to make something perform well and last a long time as to make it seem appealing to draw in the buyer. Phones are a main example of how this selling strategy has developed. Apple produces a new style of phone year after year; not with the mission of creating a durable, reliable, and long lasting phone. But instead Apple has secured its place as a top phone producer and seller by continuously marketing breaking technology and advances in the industry. Phone industries are reliant on short term consumers paying a large sum of money for a device, just to switch out for the newest model a year later.

Brands have learned the profitability of flashy advertisements and constant innovation. Something that is new and catches the eye, appealing to our imagination is much more attractive to a consumer than an item that isn't as innovative but will perform its job well for years on end. We yearn to purchase something new that will keep us drawn in, than something old that we've seen before. Commercials are a good example, never really showing exactly what the product will do and how long it will last. Instead, commercials attempt to appeal to our sense of humor and short attention span. Commercials are meant to draw us in and make us remember the brand, not to actually convince us of the product itself.
