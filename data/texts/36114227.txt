Modern society is too materialistic. Many of us accumulate too many thing without any thought to whether or not we need them or will use them. 

This is especially true of western society. Manufacturing has been outsourced to poorer countries, where people work in sweatshops to produce cheaply made goods for us. Most of this stuff is made out of plastic, which is a waste of fossil fuels. Things that are not made to last break very easily, and end up in landfills.

There is not need to live like this. We have so much stuff already that we can lend and borrow, or buy secondhand. Before buying anything, we should stop and think if they really want or need the thing. We can also look at things we've already bought, and decide if we still need them in our lives. Things we no longer need can be given away or sold.

Besides the waste of resources, there's also the financial burden of excess stuff. Not only do we spend money on unnecessary possessions, we also have to spend money on storing the stuff. Many people rent or own homes that are bigger than they really need for living space, just to have more foom for possessions.

Some people might argue that buying things is a source of happiness, but that isn't healthy. There are all kinds of free or inexpensive ways to be happy that don't involve accumulation of stuff. Others may say that conspumtion is good for the economy, but the economy must be redesigned so that it does not depend so much on people shopping. The current way of doing things is unsustainable.

We must change our attitude toward material things while we still have a choice. Soon we may not.
