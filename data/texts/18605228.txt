       Materialism is nothing but getting the happiness from the things that we buy in our daily life but not from our own which is far ruining everybody's life. One should avoid this kind of behaviour in this modern society for our development. It leads to anxiety due to comparision with others lives and life style. Beacause of this materialistic nature, One can impress others but we might end up loosing ourselves in difficut situations. 

       Sometimes I feel materialistic nature is good as it keep us up to date but coming to reality is it really worth more than our happiness? If a person own a brand new luxurious house with all amenities and more elegance where more than he afford, Can he really feel that new home pleasure for a long time? My view is like, One have to take their paths only upto where they can afford but not more than what really they can't. 

        Finally, The happiness comes out from this materialistic nature leads to health issues like unpleasant emotions and leads to unhappiness followed by bad habits a human can addict. Recent days, Everybody are concentrating more on this like branded clothes, branded cars and luxury things to show-off thier royalty etc. which is not so good for themselves even.

           So, One can practice some daily diet and exercies and also healthy lifestyle to overcome all these kind of stress and negativity. It's better to lead a simple and happy life with our loved ones without any extra worries and tensions beyond going to this worst materailistic behaviour. In the concrete jungle we are living all these days, It's good to avoid materialism. Then everybody's life will be more beautiful..
