Happiness has many meanings. If you ask ten people what the definition of happiness to them, you'll probably get ten different answers. When I was in the third grade, our teacher gave us an assignment titled "What do you want to be when you grow up?". I remember showing this to my mom and asked what I should put down. She said "happiness". At that time, I didn't know what that meant, but now I do. Even my teacher was confused at the answer. 

I believe focusing on personal goals will provide more happiness. I remember hearing my mother say, "If you don't care about yourself, who will?" This was the most memorable quote from my mother. In a perfect world, I would choose a balance of both. But if I had to choose, personal goals is the way.

From personal history, I rather care for myself then to please  others. I would rrather live for myself then to put a fake face on and please others. Some might say, sacrificing happiness for the team will produce better result. That might be true, but in my opinion, that's just lying to yourself. 

Happiness is archieving your goals. In so, you will live a satisfying life.
