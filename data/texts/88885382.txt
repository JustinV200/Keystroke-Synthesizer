   Who among us doesn't like new stuff? Fresh clothes, shiny jewelry or a fancy phone? Is this common trait a negative thing, or is it just human nature?
   
   Many people criticize those of us that come off as being too materialistic. They say it is a sign of shallowness, insecurity and selfishness. In my opinion each and every one of us is materialistic. Some more so than others, of course. The proof is visible every day all around us.

   People judge from atop their high horses but if you look closely they too have materialistic tendencies. Often people who can't afford nice clothes will act as if what they wear and how they're judged by it has no effect on them whatsoever. This is a defense mechanism. It is easier to adopt this stance than to admit those judging them are correct. They have no money/style. When I was in my teens one of the people I looked up to most was my friend Chuck. His stance on clothing was that he didn't want any clothes with brand names displayed visibly. He said clothes like that were too materialistic. I later in life realized this made him no less materialistic than the rest of us. He still valued his clothes. He just had different opinions.

   In closing I'd like to reaffirm my opinion that each and every one of us is materialistic, at least to some degree. To be completely un-materialistic would be much worse. What good can you say of someone who values no posessions, whether theirs or their friends? I think this is all insecure people throwing shade. Materialism is one of the only things that seperates man from animal. Unfortunately I don't see anything changing anytime soon. I conclude that materialism, as well as the negative perception of materialism, will always be a part of human society.
