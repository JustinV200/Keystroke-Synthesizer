I think people will achieve more success by cooperation. because cooperation is the novel work in the world. if i want success i should always take care of others and working with them for achieving the success. 

In the present world all the people are want more success by competition .sometimes competition is good but over compitition is not good for the human beings. if we always go for competition our moral human behaviors will destroy one day .and people will be selfish and no one will think another people .if i want achieved truly success i must cooperate others. we should always remember that unity is power. when both of the people of the society work at the same thing they can achieve lot of success within a very short time and for that our country will be developed by this people .one day our society will live withpeace and  harmony .there are lot of people achieve success in the world by working together . for example if a scientist reaserch something new in the lab they will not be able to invent in a short time alone but they invent lot of things with other team mate within a very short time. and lot of the organization have a lot of workers among them manager new employee senior employee and other co workers. if the organization want achieve they should work together and all the people of the organization should same goal for the achievement .and the present world cooperation helps most significantly lasting accomplishment.

So we should achieve our goal by cooperation with others. sometimes it is true that some people achoeved their goal or gain success by competition with others but i think this competition is legal for the exam hall .but this competition in the real work not good and if someone apply this competition everywhere in there real life this will make the man selfish .she?he persue for the goal their own life.for that i think people achieve more sucess by cooperation than competition.
