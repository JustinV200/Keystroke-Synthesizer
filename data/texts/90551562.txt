    Yes, In fact every thing you do will craete an impression and have an image. That is how people learn about one another. Image and impressions is the most important thing, if the person in charge sees you performing great at your very first day, that notion would remain in the head for very long and that impression gives great image to the person.

    Yeah. Lots of people care about the images and impressions. They think that "Image and impression tells everything". They see you gestures, they judge you. They hear what you say, they judge you. They touch your skin, they judge you. everything is a judgement at the firsttime. If you see someone wearing old clothes and they really stinky, What do you think?
   People form their opinion of what kind of person you are in the first few secound of meeting you and if that impression is not favorable it can be really hard to change the person's mind.

    For me, I never think about images or impression. What i belive is people changes. Images and impressions is a stupid judgement that we give to people that we never know who they are(trully they are). so if people care about images and impressions, it doesn't matter.  What matter is you.
