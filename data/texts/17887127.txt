I believe that people can only find true happiness in the happiness of others. A huge part of what life has to offer is found within the connections we have with other human beings. We were given a gift of immense emotional intelligence that is not found within any other species. When we reject making emotional connections with other humans who share this gift to go after personal goals, we are wasting one of the most distinctly human abilities that we possess.

Some may argue that happiness lies in advancing your career or making money, and I wouldn't completely disagree. These things can be rewarding, and they leave you with a sense of accomplishment. However, focusing on these goals and aspirations can be very isolating, and can leave your relationships in a state of disarray. The relationships we build with others are a reflection of the complex nature of humanity, and they're vital in your mental and physiological health.

Many traditions are rooted in community and family. Things like holidays, birthday celebrations, and other shared festivities are all about sharing happiness with one another. These things are distinctly human, and the bonds we share are incredibly unique to our own kind. Making others happy helps you build relationships and memories that last a lifetime. If too much focus is on oneself, you may find yourself alone. If you live to make others happy, your own happiness is only a phone call, a text, or a visit away.
