We all grow up being taught the addage that authenticity is what matters the most. Pretending to be someone or something you're not only shortchanges you. But that addage doesn't take into account the sheer proliferation of veneers and facades that surround us in our day-to-day life. And those veneers in turn become unassailable truths in our minds. Taylor Swift becomes the relatable girl-next-door, even if she may be someone completely different in her personal life. Celebrities like her and others become our heroes without us ever really knowing anything about them. Which is to say that these projected images of people are what we use to judge them, and so can leave an indelible effect on those who consume them.

A celebrity like Lady Gaga can project a confident, eclectic and glamorous persona, and that is all her fans and the media will see her as. Whoever she is inside gets lost in translation, if she ever even put that part of her out there to begin with. One might argue that her authentic self comes through her songs which she pens herself. But I'd argue that her songs are part of her brand image and her marketing to make herself more appealing to her fanbase and thus generate more sales. But that idea is not what her fanbase is thinking when they consume her content and extoll her persona. The veneer is what is meaningful to them because they simply don't have any other information about her to work with.

The images and personas people project of themselves is how we understand each other on a widepsread but superficial level. It simply is what it is. So while an entire fanbase can be built around a carefully-crafted personality, while that people can defend and judge their favorite people based on fabrications, that doesn't diminish the meaningfulness they individually perceive from these veneers.
