Everyday images and impressions have a profound effect on people that they don't even realize. Companies pay exorbatant amounts of money to research how people choose what they do, and how they can make us choose what they want.  I used to never think that marketing would impact my choice to buy something. But think about it further - when you're in a store looking for a certain item and you only recognize one brand from seeing it on TV in a very favorable light, what do you pick? You are almost always likely to pick the brand you've seen before, even if you don't remember how or why you did. If you don't know any of the brands in front of you at all, are you going to pick the packaging with comic sans typing in black and white, or, are you going to pick the packaging that looks like the highest quality materials with bright images? If you are being honest with yourself, you are likely going to pick the latter. 
Some might say that marketing has no impact on their decisions. However, next time you are in the situation described in a grocery store, pay close attention to your decision making process, and be willing to question your assumptions. 
In conclusion, companies are extremely efficient at figuring out how to make us buy what they want us to. if they spend enough money on convincing us their product is the best, then they rarely have to make sure their product is the best quality. All too often, what we tink we see becomes far more important than what really  is.
