I believe people achieve more success with competition.  Competition is a natural response to someone doing better than you.  You end up wanting to strive harder and do better.  You may end up studying harder for a test, working harder on a project, and improving your skills.  

Others believe that cooperation helps achieve accomplishments better than competition.  While that can be true in some cases, when it comes down to doing better, competition will always make people try harder.  Without competition, people may not want to do better and can become stagnant.  We as humans want to be successful and have material posessions, and most of those who achieve that do so with competition.  Competition made me personally try to do more for myself, and I became a better athlete, student, and employee because of it.  I wanted to make myself better myself, because I felt the drive to do so from competition.  I felt happier with myself, that I was able to do what I sought to do from it.  I remember from a young age feeling that competitive drive, and I worked harder to get better grades and be a better athlete.  I felt incredibly accomplished when I attained that.  I had more self esteem because of it, and I feel people in general have better self esteem because of competition.  

At the end of the day, you will see stronger and better results through competition.  You will see harder working people because of it.  You will end up feeling better about yourself when you achieve your goals, because you know how hard you worked to get to them.  You also will try to resolve issues yourself more, because being competitive forces you to come up with ideas on how to solve a problem.  The feeling of accomplishment is a wonderful feeling, and you will push yourself further to achieve that feeling.  You could end up being a better employee, parent, teacher, scientist, etc.  Achieving things you never thought you could.
