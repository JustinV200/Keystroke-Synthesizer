Positive results can be produced through both cooperation and competition among society.  However, competition can be more rewarding for the individual than simply cooperating with others in order to achieve the same results.  Competition can actually help someone become a better person.

When competiting with others, a person has to step out of their comfort zone in order to be successful.  There is no way an individual can ever really know what they are capable of until they have had to push themselves further than they ever have before.  How else can one truly ever know what they are made of if they have never been challenged before? That person would never know his real potential, let alone what his true strenghts may be.

If ones only choice was to cooperate then just imagine how boring life would be.  It is competition that invokes creativity in a person by making that individual have the desire to want better things; thus, desire a better quality of life. If a person went through life always choosing to cooperate rather than compete with others, then how could they ever know true happiness?

Although cooperation is a great quality an is fundamental in gaining the positive results that we may need in certain circumstances, competition is what instills the drive to be a better society.  It simply starts with the individual first.  

Competition is what motivates a person to be better, to want better and to produce better results in whatever he or she may be doing.  Healthy competition is better in the long run than simply always choosing to be cooperative in every situation.
