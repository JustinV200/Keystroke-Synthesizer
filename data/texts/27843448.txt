    Impression and images in the media have far too much of an effect on people that many of us do not realize. Take social media for instance, using social media creates emotional and physiological issues in many people. The images on social media use can lead to low- self esteem in  many people. People often compare themselves to the people on social media like influencers. People see these perfect people in images on social media and in advertisements and think that they should look like that too. When they can't achieve the same results they feel like failures and their self esteem takes a hit. Images in the media creates problems more that people think.
   People don't understand that the people they see on the media are distorted. The people on the media such as influencers or actors or models, are not real. A lot of people trying to keep up with the influencers post phony pictures and stories about how perfect their lives are, when in reality it's not like that at all. People believe what they see in the media is real, when the reality is , its not reality at all.
  Some people think that social media is a good way to stay informed. Social media can help people keep track of their friends and family lives. It does do that but there is an insideous side to it also. Social media is a good way to keep in touch but in the end it does more damage physiologically.
   In the end the damage media does is far greater than the benefits it offers. Life long physiological issues that don't just go away. The media is hurting people in many way that we don't even realize.
