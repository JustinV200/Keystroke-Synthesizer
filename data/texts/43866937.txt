The materialism comes with capitalism and the globalization, the modern society is just too blinded to spend what they produce working and working only to buy status.
Maybe because the modern life requires more hacks to dominate our time, but with the production of new articles, clothes, etc., we are doing just a damage to the world making pollution. 
We are giving importance to objects losing humanity and sense of what is happening around us. The modern society needs more than work and buy, needs to be aware of the modern issues that attack our times.
 If we create awareness about our priorities, and the minorities that are labor exploited for the manufacture of these junk items, sometimes these groups include children, the exploitation of our natural resources, the violence, all that this includes perhaps we could change our mindset.
 The awareness campaigns couldn�t have the positive impact or reach we want, the trouble starts from us and the requierements of these times, so, is very difficult to change the mindset of billions that inhabit the planet, but this would not work as long as we have big corporations working in big productions of junk products, selling with the best marketing. This only shows that it is teamwork: society-corporations.
