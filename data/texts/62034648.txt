Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? 

It's important to understand that both cooperation and competition are both great examples to look at in regards to overall success. I believe that competition is the most beneficial of the two. Competition drives innovation and creativity amongst everyone. This works best in groups, there are people that always strive to be better than their teammates/opponents, this leads to a "think outside the box" type of behavior. 

A prime example of this is Michael Jordan, who had multiple winning seasons with the Chicago Bulls. Yes, basketball is a team sport that requires cooperation amongst all team members in order to win. Michael Jordan stands out as one of the greatest players of all time because of his own drive and determination, which made him a stand-out on his own. Some may say, that Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also assisted the team in getting the wins as well. Although, those players are standouts on their own, their roles uplifted Michael Jordan's AllStar status. His competitve nature made him a hero and some will say, the best basketball player of all time.

The way Michael has played has lead to endorsements, commercials and even his own shoe-line that has made him millions of dollars over the years. All because of his name and branding opportunities he received as a result of all his hardwork over the years. People see the name "Jordan" and immediately think of success, high-demand, expensive, and they want to own a little piece of him in someway.

All in all, competition is a catalyst for driving innovation. It makes people want to be better than the last person who was known as the best. Michael Jordan inspired Kobe Bryant who in his own right became a remarkable basketball player. Michael inititated the drive to always strive to be better. We now see it in Lebron James, Steph Curry, and many others. 

Competition is key.
