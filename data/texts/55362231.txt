The answer to this question depends on individual personalities and situations. Some people are by their nature more competitive and thrive on this competition. Others, by contrast, have a more cooperative aspect to their personality that allows them to thrive in environments when they are sharing and working toward a common goal with others. 

A cooperative working environment may prove to be limiting for some people. This can depend on personality but also can be determined by the type of work involved. A sales team,  for example, does not work together but separately. They compete with each other to meet and exceed quotas. Working in this manner produces better results for both the individuals and the team as a whole. If they were forced to work cooperatively their would be less motivation to close sales and collect higher commisions. 

On the otherhand, for others, an environment of competition may be intimidating, lonely, and stressful. In certain types of work it can produce inferior results. A band, for example, is a good example of this. Every member of the group has a role to play that contributes to the musical output. The drummer keeps the beat, the bass player carries the rythym section, the singer carries the melody, etc., all contributing to the performance. If certain musicians started competing with others in the group the entire performance could break down into chaos. The crowd would boo and walk out of the performance. 

So, which is better? Neither or both depending on the individuals involved and the context. Allowing individuals to seek out environments in which they will succeed and supporting those styles is more important than trying to force people into a way of working which may be less productive for them depending on their particular personalities, styles, and goals.
