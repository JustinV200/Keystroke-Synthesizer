In the last 100 years, the Rockefeller's loved their oppulent homes, Marilyn Monroe loved her diamonds and superstar Madonna was the "Material Girl." The love and appreciation of material things has existed long before that. In ancient times people desired in the form of jewels, tools, and furs. Our modern society continues the tradition of being materialistic and the criticism of it may be unfair. 

From a young age, babies and children find comfort in their favorite toy. Sometimes we receive a reward for a job well done on a test in school. Material things begin to serve as a goal and something to keep us motivated. Our society thrives through the hardwork and dedication of its workers. A nicer car, a newer house and being able to may be the goal that gets someone through a difficult time. Having those material item to reach for can keep people employed, businesses open, and society stable. Acquiring things can also provide us with safety or stability in the form of a home or assets. 

Materialsim has been passed down from generation to generation but just because something is engrained in our culture, doesn't mean that it is what is best for us. Sometimes people obtain one thing and when it doesn't make them happy, they seek yet another. The only way to change the culture is not to criticize and make people feel shamed but to encourage change.We should reward children with experiences instead of things. They should be taught that it's not about impressing others, about the problems with debt, and how to find satisfaction in a resonable amount of material goods. Not live without them.
