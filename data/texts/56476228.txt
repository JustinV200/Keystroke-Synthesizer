Do people achieve more success by cooperation or competition? In this article I would like to answer that question. My personal belief is that people achieve more success through competition. By competing I mean that one or more people are directly trying to achieve the same goal, or are acting as each others protagonists or antagonists in some way. 

I think that competition leads to success because the person is stepping outside of his or her comfort zone. I have read that when you do what is uncomfortable it often times has lasting benefits for the person. If Oak trees did not have contrary winds as they grew, how would they ever benefit? Also, how can life have a purpose if we never go through any adversity? I know that growing up if I had not had people pushing me to be stronger or smarter, I would have withered into nothing.

Sure, a person could also argue that competition may drive people to avoid failure, or that it will make them have self-esteem issues. If a person has a kid for example, and they do not place first for a certain sport, they may start to avoid playing the game so that they do not fail. They also might feel like they aren't as worthy of praise as their more successful peers. Having more competition between the child's peers may result in their losing desire to play. If the child's peers cooperate and show him or her that they are a valued member of the team and how to play better , instead of focusing on being better than the child, all the children playing the game may benefit more.

In the end it may be that both competition and cooperation have their respective places in society. I think that having everything in moderation is important. However, competition does indeed help build stronger and smarter people. It is when competition is taking to an exteme that it becomes unhealthy. There should be a balance between people cooperating and competing.
