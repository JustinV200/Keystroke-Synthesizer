     It is my belief that you will achieve your personal happiness through focusing on your personal goals rather than the happiness of others.   After all, it is your own happiness you are trying to achieve and although focusing on others is a noble persuit, typically such things are achieved through the sacrafice to and of self.

     How to lead a life where you are trully happy?  This is the main question many of us wrestle with as we get older and first start to question the prototypical picture of happy.   The picture of a happy individual, as advertised, is one of more things, more people, more places and of course more money.   I've  been really poor and although not rich, I am in a financial position where I can see both sides of it.  Money buys a nice house, nice car, even a nice group friends and a hot husband or wife, but what it mainly buys is peace of mind.  What is does not buy is happiness.  I like to think that although I do not lead a life of blissful happiness I am more happy now then I have been at any point of my adult life.  I got to this point by working on myself.   As I have made progress in addressing my own shortcomings, I have become happier and a more pleasant person to be around.  This in turn has made the significant people around me more likely to lean in and want to be around me which has made me want to try that much more in turn.   It's a self perpetuating cycle, one that has been making me a much happier person than I was 2 years ago when I had the most stuff.

     As I stated in the opening paragraph, making others happy in a noble persuit.  However, if you have not already worked on yourself or are one of those insanely lucky individuals that were born perpetually happy, you need to work on yourself first.  It will make your life a much more pleasant experience and will make the lives of those with whom you interact that much better for it.
