Happiness for sure is an interesting subject. We wish happiness to others, and we are delighted when we feel happy ourselves. But was is happiness? It is a feeling of joy, satisfaction, and can be acheeved in many different ways.

We feel happy when we aquire something we dreamed about, like the new car. We feel happy when we recover after an illness. A nice meal at the restaurant makes us happy too, or getting a good grade on important exam. Those are the things that make individuals happy.

But i think the greater happiness comes from helping others. When you read a book to a child (because he cant read yet) and see his happy smile and eyes, filled with amazement, curiosity and delight, you feel a great happiness youself, because you helped another human being. When you find a little kitten on the street and take it home, feed it and show it some love, you feel a great joy yourself.

We live in the world filled with other humans, animals,etc. We can experience emotions, feelings. We can certainly feel the love and have people around us that we love and care for. Seeing our loved ones happy is the greatest joy of all, it makes us happy way more than acheeving ones personal goals.
