To a certain extent, modern society shouldn't be entirely criticized for being materialistic. With today's modern technology and social platforms, it's our new norm. Acquiring certain possessions like technology for example, is something we really can't live without today or else we are too disconnected from the world. Phones, computers, TVs, cameras. Feeling disconnected could lead to feeling like isolation. Sometimes these are items or things connecting us to a community of people with common interests.  

We can critize modern society for being too materialistic on a sustainable level. Do we need to produce and consume more disposable products at the rate we have been? For example, fast fashion. Is it destroying our planet? Is it contributing to climate change? I think we can still possess nice things, but scale back on the amount of products we consume, or find eco-friendly solutions to producing these products. Or, even buy second-hand products. It doesn't even have to be bought brand new. Thrift stores, vintage shops, flea markets, etc. all have treasures for everyone. What's old to someone else, could be new to you.

We can critize the rich for being too materialistic and buying unnecessary things on a grand level. Does aquiring the biggest yacht, or a $10,000 Birkin bag actually make these people happy? Does posting on social media of the latest designer collection actually give these individuals validation? Does one really need to spend their disposable income on a quick $1 million+ ride to space? That money could help millions of people with meals or housing.

If there are small things that make you happy when you purchase it, like a hobby, or thrifting, go for it. If there are things on a large scale that can be done in a sustainable way, maybe go that route or rethink if it's absolutely necessary.
