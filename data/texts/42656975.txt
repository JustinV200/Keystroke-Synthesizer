The debate against materialism can be seen in multiple percpectives, for many we rely on material things to get through day to day life, to make us happy and connectivity with others, like with family and friends or online connectivity. For example, being materialistic with our electronic devices helps us stay connected with wordly news, the most trendy things, communication with others that otherwise we wouldn't be able to do, which is return makes us consume more stuff and it makes us heavily rely on such materials.

I understand that Materialism can be quite bad, it enforces the use of spending money and needing certain things in life to be happy, to get through certain things and or to comfortably and conveniently do other things, that is why in modern society it's being seen as too materialistc, as compared to older days we didn't have these convenient materials and advance technology or other very useful materials, and it's why when compared to such older times that in todays time it's seen so negatively upon.

In general sense and conclusion, I find that yes it may be a bit too materialistic and something that is overly relied on and or a negative thing in modern times, but it's also understandable why materialism is the way it is now from some, with so many things in day to day lives and the reliability we have on these material like things, it is all for the sake of comfort and convenience, but as long as it's properly handled, with a good attitude and looking at life in a good way and knowing one shouldn't strictly rely on materialism, then I think in modern society it shouldn't be too bad beinng materialistic about some things as long as there's a balance of how it's being handled, having a healthy life style and a good ideology.
