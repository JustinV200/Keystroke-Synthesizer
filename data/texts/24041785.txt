Happiness is an important quality to attain in life.  Unfortunately, personal happiness can be fleeting.  It's easier to attain if you focus on making others happy than yourself or on the overall improvement of humanity than one's one personal happiness.  

One example would be contributing to a charity, whether through monetary donations or personal labor.  If you can see the happiness of others, it should make you feel a certain sense of satisfaction.  Even if you don't see the results, you might feel good imagining them.  In my case, I give money every month to the Vincentian Congregation to sponsor a seminarian in India.

Working for an environmental organization could be pleasant too.  If you are able to secure a position in a positively geared organization- say one for plucking plastics out of the ocean- that could be satisfying and would make you happy in the long run.  Think how good it must feel to have been part of the work that's closing that hole in the ozone!  That's so wonderful.  Cleaning up the junk floating out in space is probably also satisfying.

In conclusion, what you do to make yourself happy is ultimately up to you, but I, personally, think serving others is the best form of happiness.
