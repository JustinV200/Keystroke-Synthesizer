False advertising is one way to get people to buy products. People loves to see products that have a lot of good sides and very few bad sides. This is something that the modern companies capitalize on, by giving a product the illusion of the perfect be all do all kind of thing.

We humans are easily swayed by a good deal, without even investigating ourselves we buy products that are advertised to us. We think we are getting a good deal out of it but in the end when we start to see the product for what it actually is we become enraged at the merchant who sold us the product. While it might be true that the merchant is guilty for creating an illusion or a good impression and only the good impressions of the product we also are guilty for not investigating it ourselves. The same can be said for any other things such as celebrities we see on tv, the producers create a fake illusion where you can see only the good sides of a person and start to believe that fake illusion. On tv we can only see the best side of a person, they don't show you what a person really is like.

To summarize, yes, impressions do have too much of an effect on out lives as people. How to be safe from these false impressions? well, just by thinking by yourself for a bit.
