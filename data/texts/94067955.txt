Materials in this context are basically possessions. These possessions now have been seen as very important part of livelihood. Materials in this context give people a short term or long term value.
People of this age without doubt have seen the acquisition of all these materials to be paramount. And needless to say that, this act have been at the expense of other values. Now, the acquistion of materials is at the expense of other important things such as spending time with the family and having healthy relationships. 
Contrary to the made belief of people that the society is characterized with people who have somehow prioritized acquiring more materials at the expense of other values, the importance of these materials cannot be overemphasized. Owning possessions truly give this aura of satisfaction which is typical human. Withtout certain materials or possessions, people of this age wouldn't rate you as valuable. I really wouldn't blame anyone who is more inclined to acquiring more possessions because of the satisfaction attached to it, the satisfaction of living a fulfilled life, however, it is important to strike that balance. 
That is, while chasing possessions, it is important to have an healthy relationship with people. The infallibility of having both cannot be overlooked. Therefore, in attaining this status, it is important to draw a line between needs and wants of these possessions. Focusing on the needs give only things that are importantly important and also gives one the value to which having an healthy and stable relationship is attached.
Conclusively, a critic of the society being materialistic would only be purposeful if all individuals could strike that balance of acquiring the needs and not all there is to be acquired.
