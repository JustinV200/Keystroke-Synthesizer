The issue I've been assigned to address is whether appearances have a greater impact on a person's perceptions of reality than they should. 

It has been my observation over time that there is a great deal of validity to the position that images have a powerful influence over people, particularly in how they choose to spend their money. We are constantly bombarded with advertisements wherever we go. The food looks delicious and is beautifully prepared, we have the resort all to ourselves, the beaches are practically empty, and so on. We focus on the dream and want to experience what we see. We can easily envision ourselves in whatever scenario the actors on the screen are portraying. Our critical thinking skills take a back seat when we're enticed by the beauty of that new car. Seldom do we consider that our vacation will not be as nearly as idyllic as the commercial promised it would be.

Since our imagination is so powerful, advertisers will continue to use the power of imagery to entice people to consume their product, although there are some skeptics who will never buy into the hype; these few tend to be older and wiser. In my opinion, the younger the consumer, the more likely they will be to fall for the images without thinking about any potential downside. Human beings really are hedonists at heart, and what better way to lure them into buying your product than having that item or service associated with smiling, beautiful people in enticing, exciting surroundings?

In summary, it's my belief that what we see has the most powerful influence on what we purchase than almost any other factor and that appearances indeed have a great impact on our perceptions of reality.
