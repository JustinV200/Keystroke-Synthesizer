Happiness is something that comes from within self. Most of the people believe in the the optimistic approach which gives happiness and also it helps in negative thinking. We can rather say that this approach is an adaptation, learning from the hard times. Treating ourself as a friend also helps in solving many hard situations and it gives a self confidence which leads to the happiness. An another way to gain happiness is doing Yoga or any form of exercises to the physical body say study.

Above are some of the ways to gain happiness and boost ourself in every situation. However, when people surrounded by us are not happy, then practically we won't be happy enough. A study says that, a human can be satisfyingly happy when he is in a happy place which means the people surrounded by us have to be happy. Say when our closed one in a relationship or our best friend is suffered with a critical illness then practically we can't be happy.

There are certain factors which may define the happiness like economics, quality of life and sometimes the financial status. So being happy is not only defined by the personal goals or by the happiness of the others, but also the situations and sometimes the priorities of the person defines the happiness.
