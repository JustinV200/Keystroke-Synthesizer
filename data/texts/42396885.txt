The question of what is happinesss has confronted philosophers ever since the time of Plato and Aristotle. What makes a man truly happy? Is is satisfying material and animal desires? Is it pursuing intellectual enlightment? Is it leading a good life? These and many other answers have been proposed over the ages. I do not pretend to be smarter than the ancient philosophers. I am not even smarter than the modern philosophers. But after sixty-seven years here on earth, I can say what makes me happy: making a difference for the better, no matter how large or small, in someone's else's life, whether it is family, friend, neighbor, or stranger.

A person does not really exist except in c0nnection with others. One cannot be happy if everyone else ar0und them is miserable. It is not a question of money or possessions. People with much wealth are some of the most miserable people alive. They are cut off from the connection with others because of their wealth. They hoard it, worry about it, do everything they can to increase it beyond the realm of imagination. Elon Musk is most certainly not a very happy person. But others ultimately reach the conclusion, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet did, that true happiness lies in giving away their wealth to assist the less fortunate. Just watching them shows that they have achieved a satisfaction with their lives that eludes so many.

Granted, one who lives at an ordinary level of wealth does not have similar opportunities. But giving $10 to a homeless person, saying hello to an elderly person who is all alone, or just smiling at a random passerby, gives me great joy. I will not have news articles written about me, I am just too ordinary. Doing little things every day in and day 0ut for another will bring constant joy and contentment that will, little by little, lead t0 true a happiness that might even surpass that of Bill Gates.
