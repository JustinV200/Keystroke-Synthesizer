Happiness is something which comes from within. It can be of any form. It can come either from the own pleasure or it can come from the way that others enjoy things. We cannot surely tell that happiness only comes in this way or that way. Sometimes we can feel happy for the nice weather and sometimes when we are not in good mood we may feel sad for the same weather itself. Thus happiness merely depends on our mood and basically we all humans will go through mood swings and so it is a common issue for all.
When we set a goal to wake up early in the morning and when we achieve it we will find happiness in that way. But when we did not wake up we will feel guilty about ourself for the whole day. It will also spoil our day. But when we think in a positive way that, I did not wakeup earlier as planned in this day, anyhow I will complete the work as scheduled, this sort of thinking will not spoil our day even. It is all in the mindset.  It will do nothing for our happiness too.
In another way we can say that, when we are always in a staggering mindset and during that time when we fix a certain goal and work hard to accomplish it, we will find happiness from within. We have to plan and work according to the time being. When one of our close friends gets married or when they get a job or even when they buy a new car we feel elated without our own conscious. This is all because we humans have senses within which is the major reason for all this mind sets.
Personal goals makes us happy. Eveyone has their own goals. But the thing is more than the happiness which comes from the things which we do, the happiness which come by the way of feeling elated for others means a lot.
