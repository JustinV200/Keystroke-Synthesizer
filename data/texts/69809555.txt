Happiness has always been inside of you you just have to reach deep down and grab it. Happiness comes from following dreams and personal goals. Nothing is more fufilling then accomplishing the goals you truly beleave were intended for you. light comes from within when you know you have made it one step farther then you were yesterday, even the day before, or last year.

Happiness is not the same for everyone. something that makes me feel joy and excitement inside may not make the person next to me happy. we all have to define what would make us happy, what are my needs, what will get you to state of happieness. many people rush into carrees to make a lot of money and are not satified because they are not living up to thier true potential. people who put their happiness first offten leave for a less paying more fufilling carree or leave for a riskier route such as ownign a small business. 

People who follow their passion their whole life seem to be a lot happier, ignoring the norms and expectations of society and comitting  to their true selfs. following someone elses hopes and dreams will not give you true fufillment, unless your true goal is to please someone elses needs. true happiness has to come from what you want and dream of: what you goals you set for you to achive.
