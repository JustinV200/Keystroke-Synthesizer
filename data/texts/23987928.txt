Human beings for as long as we have lived, live in a society that is visual. We base our decisions mostly on how something is represented to us. It is no surprise that false advertisement claims are so rampent.

It is my opinion that the first impression is lasting to say the least. When an advertiser presents their product, it is their job to make the product appear as appealing as possible. This is often done by using prefered lighting, celebraties, or a bit of provocative placement. When trying to advertise something, the goal is to relate to the viewer and at the same time create the need for the said product. 

Perfume advertisements are mainly guilty of such advertising. There is no way one can experience the smell of the product. However, we are enticed by masculine, sexy, attractive images of models or places. The advertisement is to a certain extent selling the perceived experience. Whether ture or not - is of least concern. 

I feel that this form of advertisement is needed in the visual world of today. There is rarely an opertunity to experience whatever one is considering to purchase. And the purpose of the advertisement is to enhance the need by whatever means necesary. In most cases the statement holds true - buyer beware. It is a common assumtion of the advertisers that whether the buyer needs the product or not; that is solely their choice to make. The advert's job is to make you want to buy.
