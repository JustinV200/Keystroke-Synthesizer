                          Materialism is not the key to a happy life!


      In my opionion materials do not make your life whole. There are way to many people out there that care so much about the brand they are wearing, or what all they own. I just don't think that is very important. Do I want people to like me? Yes, but if they like me because of all my awesome possessions than I really don't need them around me. My main goal in life is simple. I just want to keep my family happy and keep us all healthy. 
      I am trying to instill this into my children. I know when it comes to school and all their friends that looking cool and wearing name brand clothes and shoes is important to them. However I also believe that they don't need to get all these name brand things all the time. They normally get these things right before school starts when they have good sales going and for holidays. Now of course there are always times that they may get something at different times, like if they need good Nike cleats for football or some good Addidas wrestling shoes. However they work very hard at their sports and deserve to have good shoes to do it.
       So overall am I totally against material items? Absolutely not! There are times that if that is what you want or need to spend your hard earned money on than you can. Should you do it all the time? No! Those things are not what makes a person who they are or what makes a happy life. I think everyone really just needs to concentrate on trying to stay healthy and live life to the fullest without caring about what he or she or anyone else is wearing or owns.
