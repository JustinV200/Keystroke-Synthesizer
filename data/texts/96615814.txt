     On my opinion people are more likely to be happy only if they focus on their personal goals. For every person, his goals only make his life meaningful. A person without any goal is like a person without heart who is simply useless.  So everyone must have goals in their life.
     Having goals only is not enough but to put as much possible effort to achieve that goal. Different people have different goals in their life. But nowadays majority of us have the same goals which is to get a good job.
     Having childhood goals will determine what your future will be.  We must have a plan to achieve our goals. Every goals need different plan. For example, to get a good job we must start focussing on our studies. We should start learning every new things and should be updated. And this learning process is a never ending one. That means we should not stop learning even after getting a job. 
     After achieving our goal we should set a new goal on which we should focus. For example. one's goal is to get a good job. If he achieve his goal at his 25, then he should set another goal like getting higher position in his job. Then he should focus on that.
