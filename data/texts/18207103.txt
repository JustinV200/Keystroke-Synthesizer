Those who believe that happiness is achieved by fulfilling personal hopes, dreams, and goals are limiting themselves to a shallow form of satisfaction. It is certainly easier to please one's self than to serve humanity; however, the rewards of looking beyond self-centered desires make the amount of extra effort well worth the expenditure. There is no down side to serving others: By doing so, the world becomes a better place, and the individual benefits from having a life well-lived. 

In contrast, those choosing to live according to what brings individual "happiness" may very well discover that, at the end of their life, they have nothing meaningful to show for the years spent on earth. Material gains and self-centered pleasures will seem hollow and insignificant when viewed in the perspective of a lifetime of greed. Furthermore, those who made the decision to serve themselves will also likely find themselves without meaningful relationships; indeed, they may find themselves utterly alone instead of surrounded by loving family and friends. Embitterment will be inevitable as they ponder what could have been, what might have been, if they had chosen a different road.

True, deep, and enduring happiness can be found by looking beyond the self, and showing love to one's fellow man. This will bring personal joy and make the world a better place.
