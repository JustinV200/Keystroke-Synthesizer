I feel like it depends on the type of person that you are. I say that because some people need guidance or team to achieve more success in what ever they tried to succeed in. For example like cooperations like Mcdonalds, Amazon, Burger King etc. just to name a few cooperations they're successful cooperations because they had a team that helped them become so successful just how they are now. Because without a team you cant be successful, it depends on what you are trying to be successful in as I mention earlier in the paragraph. I feel like most people or successful cooperations are able to keeps their success because they always bounces ideas from each other  and other words a friendly competition. For example when popeyes came out with the chicken sandwich with the pickle. The world went crazy over those chicken sandwiches and wanted to try it because it was something new coming from popeyes. Ever since that happened all the other cooperations wanted to bring something new to the menus such as Burger King coming up the vegan burger. Taco Bells coming up with the chickens wings. Those are few examples to mention. 
To conclude this essay people achieve more success because they uses their source and other people ideas to help them spark a new idea for their own to help them keep their success.
