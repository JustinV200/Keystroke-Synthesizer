Competition can be found in practically any situation and between any group of people. This is especially true in Western culture where we are socialized to believe that getting ahead, overworking ourselves, and winning are the ways to success. Competition is what drives capitalism and teaches us that you are only as valuable as your achievements. That is exactly why I argue that cooperation is much more beneficial to our society than competition. 

While competition can inspire great ideas and cultivate talents, it can also cause us to miss out on these same things. In workplaces where employees are put against one another to produce the best concepts, there can be isolation, fear, and discouragement. People become to afraid of asking for help or failing. Collaboration allows people to share their different perspectives in tackling a challenge. We are less likely to feel overlooked when different skills are highlighted and encouraged because everyone's efforts matter. People are able to use one another's various personal experiences and ways of thinking to recognize diverse solutions. We learn that what might be beneficial for one group of people is not beneficial for all, thus our accomplishments are more helpful for more people. 

Competition has the ability to spur people into greater versions of themselves but very often, we see that it is also burns people out until they have nothing left to give. We see people who are not physically or mentally capable of being competitive forgotten and undervalued. When we work together, however, there is space for everyone. We have room to make mistakes, learn, and recover. Cooperation enables people to realize that we do not have to live in a world where the most cutthroat win. We all can win and create equitable solutions through collaboration.
