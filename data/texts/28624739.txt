  Competition or cooporations what leads to more success. I believe cooporations leads to greater success for several reasons. When you are in competion the sharing of  thoughts and ideas are stunted. Many brains working together is always better than one. People who are more willing to work together also probably have less ego and cares more about what solving the problem can help rather getting the accolades. Working with a team also makes the chances of solving the problem quicker. It does so by you can split the work up and have the best people in a certain field work on a certain problem.
  
  Yes compitition could lead to maybe a fiercer desire to get the work done and get the recogocnition. But they will still be at the disadvantage of more people. I also would like to think people working for money and accolades can not compare to truly selfless people working in a humanatarian way. They probably wouldnt have the same financial resources either as a whole team of people could get. Lastly can cause desention in the work place.
  
  So in conclusion I feel cooperation is the far better way to complete a task than through competition. By way of teamwork, motives, and financial support that will make for happier more productive people. With less dissention amoungst the workers.
