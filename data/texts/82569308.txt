People achieve more success by cooperation instead of competition. When people cooperate, they are able to pool together resources to accomplish a task successfully. In contrast, when people compete against each other, they are forced to rely only on whatever resources they themselves have, which leads to a lower chance of success in achieving what they set out to do.

Cooperation also helps to create synergies; a team of people is more likely to achieve greater accomplishments together as opposed to what they may be able to achieve individually. Conversely, when people compete, part of their attention is actually squandered away because some of their focus is actually on beating the competition, and not by being the best that they can be.

Cooperation means that people are able to achieve results that they otherwise would not have been able to do on their own. Cooperating can also help people to save time. For example, it takes less time for two people to install a window air conditioner versus one person trying to do it all by themselves. 

Cooperation also means that people are able to play to their respective strengths in order to achieve results as a group. When people compete, they are forced to rely on their own strengths, and have no one else to help make up for whatever weaknesses they have. This makes them less likely to achieve the results that they could get if they were to cooperate with other people.
