     Images and impressions have an appropriate effect on people, because evolution has formed us to react to our environment.   As in all animals, "fight or flight" is based on environmental cues.

     In combat, "situational awareness" is a survival trait.  Knowing everything that is around you, all movement, all sounds, even smells, keeps you alive.  The slightest peripheral clue may be the thing that ensures that you live to fight another day.

     In our civilian environment, images and impressions are mainly a product of advertising-- printed, video and audio-- or all three.  You could make an argument that our awareness of advertising is also a survival trait.  It leads us to appropriate products and it warns us away from traps set simply to "take" us.  Properly attended to, advertising can preserve our health and our income, lead us to entertainment that strengthens and educates us, and lead us to the experts who can help preserve and prolong our lives.

     Obviously, an argument can be made that this is an exaggerated example of the effectiveness of advertising, and that lifelong conditioning has immunized us to its effects.  Well, the billions of dollars spent on useless products, unnecessary food, and flashy decorations argues otherwise... as well as the purchase of healthy, wise and life-extending products.

     In the end, it is undeniable that it is appropriate for us to react to images and impressions, but also that lifelong wariness is always appropriate.
