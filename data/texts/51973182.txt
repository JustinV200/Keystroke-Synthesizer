Modern society is of course materialistic but we cannot say that every single citizen is materialistic. Materialistic is someone who considers the material that is the love for things rather than considering their moral or spritual life. The love for material possessions never ends for an individual. At the same time not all are materialistic. Some own the materialistic things only for their need and demand. 

The demand of the product increases when the price is reduced and it occurs vice versa. More than the love for the things, people start buying them just for the sake of showing their richness. They consider being materialistic is the only means of being happy. More than buying things for thier own needs people start buying things for their happiness that is to satisfy thir soul.

Of course the modern people can be criticized. Only if they are crictised they will come to know their unnecessary expenses. If this unnecessary expenses is reduced the people may live a peaceful life with their family without any stress. On being materialistic the society may face debt, unhappiness in their lives. All these leads to mental stress and depression. Instead of being too materialistic, the society can buy things they are in want and lead happy 
meaningful and a peaceful life.
