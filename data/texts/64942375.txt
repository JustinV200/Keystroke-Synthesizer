Being materialistic is a good one where we have developed to a larger extent and we can feel that it is a welcoming change to the society. But many people used to criticize this one because these people like to live a normal life. When we think about happiness and meaning it was a needy one and it will surely create a better meaning and more and more stuff to our belief system. I have experienced this one in my life and struggled a lot in life and after many years I reached a good position when I leaned that spending time in reaching a good job was truely appreciated by everybody rather than being criticised. Modern society everyday like to be appreciated for this materialistic change.

At first I thought that money and possessions when we have in lesser amount we will feel free and satisfied.I spent my fifteen years as a clerk in a bank and everyday is a worried day for me, because I got a low salary and it was very hard for me to live a satisifed life. After many years I changed myself and learned that we needy more money and possessions for a good life and through this we can help others and everybody can shine like me in their lives. So I decided and worked hard and now I am working in a good job. I am the CEO of a big financial company.

Materialistic is a amazing one and many people like this nowadays and they are appreciating. If we see a good change through this we can welcome and encorage. We should know where we can use this one at what level. Materialistic is a fact that it should not ruin ourselves and others. Really we can feel that when we enjoy it and surely it will bring you real meaning and happiness to the life. IF anyone like to live  a satisifed and content life thay should reach great monet and possessions in life. Being materialistic is an inspirational one, and if we like to shine like a star try to be materialistic rather than being criticized.
