Often opinions are formed based off of what they think they know or what they have heard about a person or thing.  Instead of getting to know someone or taking the time to do the proper research, people base their assumption on things by what they see or think they see and not what is truthful.
             Some things in life you just have to trust what you can not see may be better or more important than what can be seen.  Some people in the media are portrayed as one thing and this is what everyone believes just because the media says so and instead of trying to find out the truth they just believe the rumors because everyone else says it's true.  If the media says something, people just automatically believe it.  The images people create in their mind becomes the way they think everything really is, without finding out if their images are accurate.
            Some people judge a book by its cover, when actually the most beautiful thing about a book lies between the front and back covers.  The same is true about people, if you judge someone by the way they look or the clothes they wear, you are probably missing out on knowing the real person.  People and things are more than just what is on the outside.  The most important thing you can do is always make sure you know all the facts before assuming something about a person.
