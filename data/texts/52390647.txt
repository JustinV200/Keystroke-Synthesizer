Materialism is killing the society we live in! Day in and day out we are spening more time, money, energy, thought on the things we want to procur in our day to day lives. If you were to look around your house you would be able to get a realistic picture of what this materialism looks like. We are collecting more and more at such a rapid pace, while at the same time trying to keep up with the "Jones". While collecting so many materials may seem like a good idea in reality we are hurting not only ourselves in the process but also others who are exhausting all of their resources trying to aquire these material things trying to keep up. 

You may say that it is not a bad thing to have such items in our everyday life and that these items help us with everyday tasks however, our reliance on such items to handle things for us will be out downfall. Look at  IQ scores of college age kids these days. They will be the lowest they have been in years. You may say that college graduation rates are at an all time high, however that is because grades are given out on less black and white grading scale. It will take many years to fully see what the affects of this materialism will do to our culture and society but I can tell you this, It will not be good!

Not only are we mentall hurting ourselves with materialism, we are hurting this planet as well. Where will we be able to put all of our material items that we no longer need or deem useful. With limited space on Earth it will be a matter of time before we are filled to capacity in our own garbage and waste.  We need to make a change and make it now! Without chage the world may never be the same and honestly we shouldn't wait till it's too late.
