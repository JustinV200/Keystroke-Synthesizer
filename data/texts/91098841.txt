Materialism is the thing that everybody loves to hate because materialism means to  believe everything what we see. This is the reason the people loves to hate materialism. It is wrong in my point of view because when we believe everything we will be easily cheated by everyone. But it depends upon the situation because the opposite of materialism is being spiritual means giving whole confidence to God.  When we relay on God and that too make us cheated by all.
                       being materialism or being spritual both depends on the expereincing situation of that individual. totally relaying on materialistic is also bad totally relaying on spiritual is also too bad so we should decide what should be choose according to the situation.
                       if we are balanced in our decision it will be good because always being in a balanced state is good. so we should decide according to the situation. being of both materialistic and spiritual is good not relaying on only one.  materialism means acquiring possessions and spending money it is a vital source of meaning and happiness  in our time. the answer for the question of  should modern society be criticized for being materialistic is may be yes or may not be yes so this is my answer.
