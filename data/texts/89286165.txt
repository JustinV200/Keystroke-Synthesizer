happiness can be different for different people, as human beings with free will we all have our own definition of happiness and we all choose to be happy that way. People has always been doing their own thing (in terms of preferences) in being happy.

people can happiness via a plethora of methods but most common are following personal goals or helping others find happiness. Both of them are valid reasons to be happy. Well you don't need a "valid" reason to be happy, it is a natural reaction towards whatever you like. Most people like helping others find happiness in their own life. Which makes them happy, which is good if we think of the service to the society, but as mentioned before you don't need to think about the pros and cons of a preference to be happy. while most others might find happiness by following and achieving their own goals in life. Which is more of a common sight these days. Because one can see the fruit of their labour affecting their own life and thus feeling happy.

being happy or happiness is a natural reaction for us as a human being. one normally can't choose what makes them happy in life. It happens sub-conciously. So i believe the term "happiness is relative" really makes an effort to prove this.
