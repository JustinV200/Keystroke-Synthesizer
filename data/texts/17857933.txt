Introducion:
                     In workspace we all are facing one issue. That is lack of co-operation. In workspace, I think co-operation and collabration is the important thing to achieve together. It will benefit the whole organization. And it will help all in an organization individually too. Now we will see what are the benefits of co-operation.

Position:
                    Here my position is people should co-operative with others. Here we take  an example of ants. Ants are mostly co-operative and they work hard together to pick one object from one place to other. And they successfully achieved the task which seems impossible to our eyes. So I wish for everyone to succeed they need to work and collabrate with others.

Reasons and evidence: 
                   There are lot of evidences for co-operation leads to success. Now we can take an organization which is urged to complete a project within a date. If one team can't complete a project within a date, they will call for other team to split the work and this will lead completing their work quickly.

Counterarguments and rebuttals:
                   Some people says co-operation will not help them individually and it will not allow them to grow forward individually. But growing together is the major and important thing. I can say for sure that we can achieve individually because of group work.

Conclusion: 
                   So I am here to say that co-operation and collabration will lead to success.
