In my opinion we should be focus on our own and personal goals because because people's are always says their opinion because they have their own minset if you take it to our mind it will affect our decision on our personal goals. Everyone has their personal life we need to fullfil our dreams and needs for our own happiness. Sometimes people says to demovitate words about our goals I don't take it personally because they says their limit not ours.
  
   For that means you don't need to hurt other's happiness but prove them that our personal goals are how much mean to you and how that things going to make others also proud. All people's need to be happy for focusing on their goals. If we will sacrifice our goals for other happiness later we regret that decision because we will live once so doing what we love only going to make us happy. Sometimes people's always get happy for our personal goals  and they will get inspire how hard we work for our personal goals.

    This is my opinion about focusing on our goals will make us happy and in some point it will also make some people's happy who was close to us. We need to just think about it. It will was a worth for making this decision one day wegonna be proud for focusing on our personal goals. Goals are always need to be private and completely that gonna make us happy. We don't need to focus on others happiness by sacrifice our own goals. All we need to be happy for our personal goals and how we will put an effort for it. I believe nothing gonna make us happy than focusing on our own goals. But we also do something good for our environment and we need to make it better. Our goals will never be disturb the society or anyone. We also be get focus to improve our environment and humanity.
