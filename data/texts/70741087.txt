I am a strong advacate of, "you must help yourself before you can help others." A very wise man once said,"How can you get the speck of dust out of your friends eye when you have a log in your own eye?" The proverb is saying you have to correct your own problems, work on your own goals before you can help someone else out. How can you help someone that may have a very little problem (a speck of dust in their eye) when you are blind with a log that is sticking out of your eye? If you don't have a firm footing in life and establish a source of income you could not help others that much with money, or even with your time.

 If you reach all of your goals then you will have the flexability to give more money to help people and to spend more time helping others without it being an impact on your life.
 Some people may argue that giving is a reward of its own. This is true, but if you worry about the life of others while you can't help yourself it will not do any good and you may end up bitter. Just think you may see a friend that you wanted to help life and you spend time and money and you are there to help without working on your goals. They may ending up with a more productive life with all of her/his dreams coming true and they may forget about you after they have made it. While you are left alone with no real foundations. 

I say help others yes but focous on your goals so you can be a better provider of time and money, and then you can besomeone that can not only be viewed as a giver but a strong roll model also. if you follow this path you can be a better help to yourself, family, friends, and the rest of humanity.
