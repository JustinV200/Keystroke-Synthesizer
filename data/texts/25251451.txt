The competitive complexity of the modern world may indeed drive the world further apart. A more balanced approach has several benefits: Achieving desired goals faster, with a system that is more inherently sustainable. As a general philosophy, mutual co-operation can be applied to business, diplomacy or a general way to get along with people in our daily lives.
  A co-operative approach is not only beneficial, for large scale business it is critical. Many different systems, both human and mechanized must be co-ordinated to operate smoothly, and without failure. Having a competitive corporate culture within an organization could give workers less incentive to share information. That same failure to communicate, in turn may have a negative impact on how employees treat one another on a daily basis. Having a positive work environment is a part of some of the largest corporations in the world. Apple, for example, uses a co-operative approach in order to develop new programs. Developers use open-sourced technology to share their ideas. This enables them to solve their problems faster.
 In some ways, one might argue that competition can drive revenue up, incentivizing higher output. This may be beneficial in the short term, but it hurts sustainability in the long run. 
  Overall, co-operation is a far more beneficial approach when compared to the caveats of a competitive mindset.
