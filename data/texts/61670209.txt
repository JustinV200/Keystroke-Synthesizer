Im going to be addressing whether or not people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals or if they focus on making others happy. My honest opinion on the topic is i believe people are more likely to be happy if they put others peoples happiness before their own, let me explain. 

For the most part, people who put themselves first are selfish. It's evident people who are so worried about themselves and not about other people usually are prideful and don't have real genuine relationships. We see it all the time, the rich person who sacrificed everything in life to achieve success that regrets not spending more time with family and friends. Being successful sounds great but how great will it be if you have no one to share it with?

I understand people may say, "How can you worry about the happiness of others if you're not happy yourself" but i honestly believe that true happiness comes from uplifting your neighbor. There are times where I've been in a low estate but when the oppurtunity arised and i had the chance to help someone it gave me happiness. You worrying so much about yourself and your personal achievements and never being there for a friend can bring more anxiety and stress into your life. Also by you putting other peoples happiness before yourself you will have more sincere, genuine friends which will help you in your time of need which will overall improve your happiness.

Ultimately, i truly believe people will be way happier if they put some of their personal problems and goals to the side and put more energy into being a better friend, and just a better person. If the whole world only cared about their own happiness and being caught up on individuality then i believe no one would truly be happy.
