Now we are discussing about the topic materialism. Most of the people live in this materialistic society. Because they want to prove themselve as a rich person to this world. The main problem was they don't know how to earn or spend money for their actual needs.
In early days the people are interested to learn or gain knowledge about their life but nowadays they are focusing how to earn and being wealthy as soon as possible.  Parents should educate their child about the spriritual, humbleness and help other person when they need help. 
Teenage persons mainly focused on materialism because they want to prove to the society as a brand. They assume that being wealthy (rich) is the most important in his life however that is not truth it may leads to stressful to thei remaining life. I have heard from television that the psychologist says that if we always gives same work (for example: about money) to our brain it will leads to narrow thinking or anxiety.
So please give same exact important to other than money. You can travel to some new place that will helps to mind refreshing and you will work more energinetic when compare to your previous days. Always enjoy each and every seconds because you have one life.
