       Have you ever heard the saying "what you see is what you get"?  In todays world I feel this is indeed just a saying and not reality.  I believe that images and impressions have to much of an effect on people in our society.  People as a whole are very much persuaded by what the see and are told to believe.  I believe this plays a big role in the problems our country is facing today.

      I beleive that many people in our society today are incapable of being independent thinkers. From a young age they have been programmed to believe what they see and not to think outside of the box. Many people are taught not to questions things and to just take everything for what it appears to be.  Society today cares more about apperances than ability.  They would rather have someone who talks the talk than someone who walks the walk. They let peoples image and their impressions speak for their capabilites rather than their qualifications and actions. 

      You may be wondering why this even matters or how it is relevant at all.  Well you see when we rely on images and impressions we often do not get what we expected.  It is easy to dress things up and make them appear to be something they are not. If we allow the media or advertisments to persuade our opinions based soley on images we are doing ourselves an injustice. 

     In closing I would like to encourage each of you to be free thinkers and truly evaluate things for yourself. Dont rely of images or others opinions to make desicions for you.  Overall you will be more satisfied knowing that you chose something or someone based on facts than on perceptions.
