It has never been uncommon for images and impressions to have a great effect on people. Prior to the advent of photography, film and its media descendants, the verbal descriptions and in some cases accompanying artwork for visual representation had an impact on the perception of people, places and events. An early example would be Homer's The Odyssey in which one of the central characters was Helen, the woman whose "...face launched a thousand ships." 

During the Spanish Civil War, one of Picasso's paintings on the firebombing of a city had as much revelance and bore as much weight as the photographs supplied by war correspondents. Robert Capa's photo of a charging Spanish Republican soldier at the moment of death was very affecting. Perhaps the entities perpetuationg violence would view the effect of the images as too much, but those advocating for change would not. 

Presently, images and impressions have a great effect but it cannot be said it is too much. It is the viewers' subjecting interpretation that lends the power of the effect, i.e. the ability to "change the channel." 

The exponential increase of social media in our daily discourse leads to what may seem is an overhwelming choice of images, almost a bomdbardment. Viral videos have led to the creation of subcultures such as complaining "Karens" and "Chads". While some of the content may be distasteful, such as those feeds celebrating street fights, it is the ongoing thirst by the consumers that drive the production. 

Ultimately, the effect cannot be categorized as too much as all users have the ability to not view the incoming media. Some of the sources are behind paywalls or subject to advertising so it is a conscious choice to view the content.  Yes, images and impressions have an effect, but it is up to the recipient to decide on how to regulate the impact in their own lives and careers.
