Images and impressions do, in fact, have too much of an effect on people.  Advertisements is a very good example of this.  Insurance commercials, like Geico, for example, uses a animated talking gecko, to sell you car insurance.  While the gecko is funny, and briefly describes what you can possibly get with their product, it can backfire.

The company relies on using comedy in their commercials, to lure people into using their service.  That, from what I can see, is the main selling point.  When they describe what you can get in that commercial, that is only what you can get, if they allow it.  Realistically, you may not have a great experience.  For example, they might say they'll save you money on insurance, when in fact, it's one of the most expensive options out there, at least from my experience.  If the funny talking gecko wasn't a big part of the commercials, people wouldn't be as interested in checking out the service.  

There are times, when images and impressions have life-long impact on people, Coca-Cola is an example of this.  In the last century, they created one of the most iconic figure in the world, Santa Clause, to promote Coke to people during the holidays.  Although not many people knows that now, because Coke don't talk about it, it caused a massive impression on everyone.  Long time ago, people would picture Coca-Cola every time they seen Santa, whether it's at a shopping center, or on TV/radio.  Nowadays, when we think of Santa, we think about the presents under the tree.  Nobody makes the connection that Coke created the figure now, even though they see him on the soda cans around the holidays.  Late in adulthood, some will wonder where the origins came from, and will look it up on the internet, to get an understanding of the real story.  Turns out, it was just an effective advertisement campaign that became something much bigger than the company itself.
