So i belive with modern society and the way we value materialistic things seems to be an interesting questions as when is too much too much? I think there are multiple angles to look at as this i believe goes deeper thing than wanting possesions but i think it may be engraved into our dna and how we have evolved after so many years.
To me it seems that we as a human species as always been on the hunt and trying to take home the trophy prize, wether it is a big game to feed the family or village or the new phone or new tesla that is out. I believe it is engraved in our identity to try to obtain items to bring home and posses as it shows status and also capability. No one wants to be viewed as someone who is uncapable wether it is old times or current times. 
Some will say well there is a point of too much and they need to limit one's wealth or material possesions. But what would that say as a society? That we have limits? That too much success is no good? I think it is perfectly natural for us to go and try to obtain ites and possesions and status in order to make us feel good and for idenitiy purposes. 
So next time you see some smuck who seems to have it all and you are vindicitve towards them, understand its deeper than one person reasoning and thinking, we all have this strive for materials and possesions so dont judge ones accomplishment.  
In the end time and time people in lower positions always tries to questions and look up and try to say they are too materialistic or they have too much wealth. One can understand why they do, but it shouldnt take away the ones achievments and limit their gains only to make others feel better. If this concept would be introduced into society it would make us overall less productive and acheive less as there will be no motivation and incentive in order to acheive mankind.
