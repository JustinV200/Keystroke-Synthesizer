       People strive for success in a variety of ways. Two of the most recognized ways that people believe success can be acheived is through competition and cooperation. Although success can be achieved through both these, many argue over which is better. Compitetion may push people to do more, but cooperation is the more efficient and beneficial way to reach ultimate success. Cooperation can lead to better relationships and efficiency making it the superior way to promote succcess.
       Cooperation is essential for day-to-day life. There are many situations in which you have to work as a team with other people and cooperation is needed. Learning how to cooperate effectively with other people can enhance relationships allowing for bigger ideas and accomplishments. Although competition can create an atmosphere that makes people want to accomplish more, it can create a barrier between relationships. Those who are competing are not going to work as well as together as well as those who practice cooperation due to the idea that they are against one another. Working together can lead to the exchanging of ideas and allow for a bigger achievment than one from a single mind. Cooperation can also bring about success quicker since more than one person is contributing. Cooperation can create a more relaxing atmosphere that will enhance result quality whereas competition can create tension, ultimately hindering success. 
       Therefore, cooperation is much more important than competition. Competition can bring about more accomplishments; however, cooperation will bring about accomplishments of better quality at a quicker rate. Working together is essential and can ultimately create long lasting accomplishments of better quality. People should not have to compete in order to maintain sucess because while it is engaging, people who cooperate are more likely to achieve more meaningful accomplishments.
