Materialism is the collection of many different things. For example, it could be clothes, cars, or gadgets.

Many women love to go shopping for clothes. If you were to look in their closets it would, most likely, be full. Their drawers would be overflowing, and their shoes would be in excess. Their closets would consist of years of collecting clothes.

Some men , on the other hand, like to collect cars. I'v seen garages with many cars from old to new. Perfectly polished cars sit in the garage as if they were on display. On the other hand, they probably have some that look as if they are being rebuilt. It's an expensive hobby for sure.

Lastly, my favorite, is buying new gadgets. I still have gadgets, I no longer use, just sitting around. Gadgets are a lot of fun and I'v collected many of them over the years. I would be willing to spend a lot of money on a gadget that I really liked.

For me, I prefer simplicity. My clothes are simple, I drive a decent vehicle, and I try not to spend too much money on the newest gadgets these days. I find that the less stuff I have the less stressed I am. 

In modern society, we consume a lot of things. We are a society of consumers. Importantly, It keeps the economy going. I don't think modern society should be critized for how they spend their money on things. Some people love to have a lot of materialistic things and others, like me,  like to keep it simple. It's really about what makes you happy.
