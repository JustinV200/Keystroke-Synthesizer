                               Yeah, i agree the point that our modern society needs to be criticized for being materialistic. Our ancestors mostly never satisfy on materialistic products they only rely on the day to day happiness by communication with the neighbouring friends and families , but now a days people came into the thought the materialistic products are the only things satisfies them and makes them happy and never focuses on the other ways of happiness and loses the point of communication with others. This has a drawback that it can lead to stressful mindset because it does not provides a stable happiness.
                                If a person gets a desired materialistic product later on it gets bored and they long for another materialistic product  thus it keeps going and going on and it never ends because human desires on materialistic products never ends its the human nature.Thus by long term they gets used to it and forgets other ways of happiness and come into a circle.
                               Thus i conclude that people now a days are needs to be criticized for being materialistic and make an awareness of it and make them think like our ancestors because it has various drawbacks thus it needs to be changed.
