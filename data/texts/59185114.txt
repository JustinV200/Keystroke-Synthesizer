Our eyes are the window through which we view the world. All too often, advertisers, the media and politians try to show us what they want us to see rather than present things as they truly are. Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people in today's world.

Take political ads for instance, we are shown a few "facts" and some pictures of what the ad wants you to think about the politician's opponent. Truth is seldom in the picture. Images are used to hide facts. One ad from years past here in North Carolina comes to mind. A person was running for state senate who was in a wheelchair. The ads for this person only showed a few older pictures from his time in the military. No recent photos were shown. He was pushed by the state Democratic party and won the election. Only after he was elected, did voters learn of his disability. 

Would he have won if this was made known before the election? I can't say but voters should be made aware of all the facts and be allowed to make up their own minds. The politician in question turned out to be a fairly effective senator but he did not live a long life, dying at a fairly young age. He may not have been given that opportunity if the facts were known before the election. Therefore, some would say, it is OK to hide things from voters. This is not a very good way to do any type of business, political or otherwise. The truth is always the best.

We need to be careful and think about what we are being shown and, even more so, what we are not being shown, when people are trying to persuade us to do something or vote for someone. Flashy images and carefully curated photos can conceal a story, as well as tell one.
