The power of cooperation is vital to acheiving maximum success in a stated goal.  A group of people united in reaching a shared goal and ultimately a shared reward can achieve great sheights of success in a relatively short time.  Others feel that a competition is a better way to go but the results will not be as complete and satisfactory.  I can give examples from my work history to illustrate both methods and their relative success.

My first job as an engineer was for a well known company that manufactured electronics.  It turned out to be a completely toxic workplace where no one worked together for very long and the mechanical engineers and electrical engineers were constantly in compettion for the ultimate design.  I was never able to complete a project in the time I worked there and the company is now out of business.  Another job I had as an engineer was for a very small company where the engineering staff was one mechanical and one electrical engineer and some support staff.  We all had to work closely together and cooperate with each other to successfully complete a design and it was a very rewarding experience.

Ultimately, as I have tried to show by these examples, success can best be acheived by cooperation.  Those who advocate for competition would argue that those results are better but what this really means is they might be faster if the workers are intensely driven to succeed.  But the solution they come up with will only be the product of one mind, not several minds working together comprehensively.  Of course some success can be acheived by either method.  As an engineer I have worked on several different design teams at several different companies and the successful completion of a project was always acheived by cooperation and teamwork.  And the success reflects favorably on all the members of the team and leads to more projects for the indiviiduals and more success for the company as a whole.
