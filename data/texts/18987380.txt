Materalism has good and bad elements. The good ones are that obtaining goods and services is a means to survival. We all need stuff to survive.  Obtaining just enough is the key to success .

How do we know when enough is enough? Enough is when we have what it takes for reasonable survival. this means housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and just enough to survive. It is not to include over indulgent items that are not required for basic survival.

Materialism begins to exceed normal when we already have enough to survive and begin to want more. Wanting more is an emotional out of balance situation that can be managed if the right tools are used. These tools depend on a person's individual characteristics. One size does not fit all. Finding the best tools for emotion management is finding what works best for you. It may be religion or meditation. Spiritful or not.  It just depends on each person's physical and mental make up. We can find the right tools if we want to bad enough.

Overcoming or avoiding materialism is a work in progress. It takes effort and some time to accomplish the right technique for each person, but, it is definitely, within our reach if we try hard enough. An analysis of our behaviors is a good way to begin. Determine where we are having some problems and develop a method of addressing the situations. We must be real and candid with ourselves and really want to control our spending on needless stuff.
