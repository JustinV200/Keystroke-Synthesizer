When it comes to cooperation verses competition, I believe more is accomplished by working together rather than working against each other. Lots of modern technology has been created with cooperation, as well as modern medicine and more. Humanity would not be where it is today with out working with one another. Through out the centuries, people have relied on one another for a helping hand. 
When it comes to the world's current times, we have developed so much by building together, whether it be communities, medicines, machinary, transportation systems, or power grids. If we were to compete in these areas, I do not believe we would be anywhere near as advanced as we are today in all areas mentioned. I believe it would pose a negative outcome and sour attitude towards these areas in a selfish manner to keep favorable ideas secret to "win" the competion. When we cooperate, we can build off each others ideas, and openly discuss different paths of opportunity in the desired area, which brings better results. When everyone works together, manually or  mentally, societies tend to have a brighter future than those with single-minded ideas. When you look at countries who want to compete with the world rather than working together in it, how do their people live and how happy are they?
I do believe there should be a healthy amount of competition in some aspects of life, but to truly achieve real success one must be open to the idea of cooperation, in work, play, love and friendship. To thrive in this ever changing world, we must have each other to turn to, not to turn against. I think it goes without saying, that always competing in life will keep you down, and that working together for an equally desired result is much more prosperous in the end.
