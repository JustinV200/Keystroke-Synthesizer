I feel like both are valuable. I feel intense rivalry is not a great thing and can be harmful but there is nothing wrong with. Some healthy competition with people you see as a friend or ally. When you see someone as your enemy it can be harmful in the way that people will do vile things to be better and succeed against their enemies were as if they are your ally you want them to succeed to and it is fun to see who will do better.

 Cooperation is great and is the best route to take in almost everything. I feel like when we can cooperate we defintely should. It helps a lot to be able to cooperate in almost any area of life. It is hard for people to cooperate whe they have different goals or agendas. There are also bad and terrible people and they will not cooperate if it does not benefit them. Some people are just awful and egos get in the way of us working together.

We are raised to compete with eachother since we are young. This is were I think the problems start with some people. I don't think most people understand the value of healthy competion and can not handle losing some times. When poeple can not handle losing they will do anything to get ahead. Including horrible things that can be harmful to others.
