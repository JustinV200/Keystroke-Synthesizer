 Images have major impressions on people who don't want to take the time to understand a certain topic.As well as impressions we get some people and their opions. Pretty little jingles that stick in someone's head when their shopping. Doesn't at all mean it's the best but makes you think of it while shopping.
    It's also much easier to ask someone their political opinons of a person who wants to be president then to do the actual work. But in doing so you get their perspective in relation to their lives and not your own. Just as if I would see a commercial and see images of a really great laundry soap. It doesn't mean it'll work for my particular stains or use if someone tells me it works for their kids soccer outfits.  What if I'm a mantaince tech? These are two very different stains and one persons impression of laundry soap my not work for me. And just because it's a commercial with a really cute bear doesn't mean  it's worth buying.  The same as a president. If I watched tv and saw images of an incoming politician everything they say is exactly what they think I want to hear. And what would make them look the best to get elected. It doesn't mean , first of all, will be the truth and also good for me or situation. The friend that I'm relying on to tell me their impression could be rich and the perticular candidate could be cutting their taxes and raising mine. My friend might have a totally different belief system and their impressions would not be good for me or my family.
  Everyone needs to exercise a little common sense and do the research in whats good for them and their family. Because if you just look at the shiny and pretty outside without all the facts you aren't seeing the 
full picture of anything.  That's probably why the lemon law came into effect.  To protect people who don't do the research and also dealers who just want to make a quick buck off of anyone they can.
