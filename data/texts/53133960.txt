Happiness is a feeling, not a destination.  A lot of people think that achieving certain things in life will give them happiness. If they get that job, get that guy, get that house, they will be happy. I think that achieving goals does contribute to happiness, but people are not going to be fully happy unless they are happy within. 

Someone who does not look within themselves for happiness will have a hard time being happy. People who focus on the happiness of others for their own happiness will tend to fail at being happy. It is not someone else's responsibility to "make" you happy. If you are in a relationship and are feeling unfulfilled, look within yourself. Once you become happy in your own skin on your own, it is easier to be happy in a relationship. Obviously, being with the wrong person will never make you happy.

I think people who put their happiness on their own personal goals will end up happier than focusing on the happiness of others. Achieving your personal goals makes you feel accomplished and worthy of feeling happy. It is up to the individual person to provide happiness to themself. 

In conclusion, I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own self.
