People will get happiness with their personal growth only. They don't have time to think about others, everyone is running towards their goal without thinking about the rest of the others. All are thinking that, if they look into others life they cannot reach their goal on time. We are all selfish, we are depending on others sometimes for our own growth.


As an example, I'm working in mturk platform and doing work for various requesters for money. Both of us are running towards our own goals. If you say that, you won't pay for my work in the initial stage itself, i won't work for you and waste my time, i will work for other requesters. And if i say that i won't work for you, you will get your work done by others. In the end, we will still reach the goal in different ways. You won't get happiness by paying me, but will be happy with the job done by me. And i won't be happy with the job that i did even if it is good as money will be the primary goal for me. Then i will do my duties with the money i get and you will do your duties with the job that i finished.


So in this case, we both will dependent on each other to reach our goals and won't have time for other stuffs. We both will travel in separate paths after that. In the end, our goals only wins.
