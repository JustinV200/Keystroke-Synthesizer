     Is materialism something that should be criticized or has it become an inevitable truth of the world we live in? Whether we like it or not, it's becoming more and more clear that the the latter is becoming the truth of this world. We have all become buyers of the small and large, whether we like it or not. Even if you try to avoid buying things, it is clear that you can not avoid purchasing materials. 

     I do think however that this are people who are too focused on the materials of the world. Does one need hundreds of articles of clothing or a fleet of cars for just themselves? I think that most people can readily agree that the answer to this is no. After obtaining so many items, the joy and positive gains from those new items becomes less and less. This leads to a question that is becoming more relevant over time.

    Where is the cut-off between over-the-top materialism and just living in our current society? I think that this question is much less clear. Society promotes that happiness is determined by having more and more items and many people try to live beyond their means to achieve this "happiness." It's understandable that people want more to achieve this "happiness" and look-up to people that do have more than they do. I do not think we will ever be able to escape this comparative society; there will always be someone with something you want or think you want. We are products of this society. My hope is that one day we will all be satisfied with what we have (within our means and without comparison.)
