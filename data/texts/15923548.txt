Some of us promote only one way to achieve the success that is competition, Yah i too accept those kind of thought but the foremost thing in the way of accomplish a goal we also need cooperations of our sorrounings like our family had to support us to accomplish the goal our friends have to coordinate with us to achieve the goal that we set to accomplish even our girlfriend or boy friend have to support us and give us the space to gothrough our goals.


How the cooperation is most important to accomplish the goal as much the same we have to found our competitor to  get a move forwar towards our goal , Therfore we shold'nt set our competition on the path of our goal we may be get back on our path or stayed on the same place where we started.


Both competition and cooperation are the two eyes of our goal we have to maintain the both and have to balance these on the path of our goal competion gives us motivation and the cooperation gives us strength we have to consume both the strength and the motivation on the goal so, The morale is signifing that both are impotant.
