I believe people achieve more success by cooperation, at least in a corporate setting. Competition is great if you play sports, even if you play sports for a living however, competition can alienate coworkers.

When you are in an environment of competition, everyone is out for him/herself. This will cause resentment among co-workers, especially in a team setting. Nobody likes to be one-upped.

I once worked with a person who had been everywhere and done everything. There was nothing you could say without him telling you his opinion. If you were going to a new restaurant, he had already been there. If you were going to take a cruise, he had already done five of them. He was annoying to say the least.

Some people believe competition is a good thing even in the workplace. Law offices are famous for it. Who can work the most hours? Who can win the most cases? Who can make the most money? When that is the culture, nobody wants to cooperate with anyone else because at the end of the day, it's winning that matters and that's how they measure success.

Success is measured by how well goals are met in a company and there are very few that are accomplished by one person.
