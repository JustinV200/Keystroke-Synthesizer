Well if you ask me I do feel that all to often its what we don't see that is more important. We go through life each and every usually with a faced on our face pretending that every thing in our life is ok.  Why is it that we do this, for oursake or the sake of others.  I mean truly this befit of hiding what's really going on in our lives.  Is it meant to benefit us or those we surround ourself with.

Going though life worried about what others may think or say should not be the way we live each day. Our lives should be a store to be told for all those we meet and encounted so listen and our lives be told.  We are unique and diffrenet from face to face and cheek to cheek.  There's a reason for why where here to be a page, chapther or even the whole story.  

When you meet someone who lives their live in the open, without a care to hide.  Is truly a gifted and wise individual as he's living his life.  As you see when you're hiding your not being yourself.  Yet something not real, nor ture and definitely not you.  Were not meant to hide and live lies, as we all have different stories to tell, starting with one sentence, a page, a riviting chapter that we all may find crazier than hell.  But without my story and your's and all of ours we would not have our lives or history to live on and tell.  Great travels, experiences, and fun times and scary ones just as well.

Altough we all travel different paths we each have a story to tell.  However different, unique or exciting to tell.  I just hope that my story goes on for sometime and has many fun times
