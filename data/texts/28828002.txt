Competion means one person have to competite other person but cooperation means both can solve any trouble with their  minds. In competition only one person can think about the problem he face, but in cooperation they can find a differnt ways to solve the problem and can solve any problem easyly.

For example if a single person starts a business he will face a lot of troubles in his business. But if a group of peoples starts a business the trobles willbe much lesser in ratio. In single person business he only haveto solve the problems in financially,mentally, and physically also that will givehim a lot of struggles to sustain in this society but if group of peoples starts a busines means they will give one to one help if some person is capable of technical means he will support as technical if some persons is capable of financially means he will support as financially,and also if some person have some working skill means he will support in physical works thats the benefits of cooperation but you can't get any kind of these cooperations in competition.

so only i personally thinks cooperation is better way to sustain this society. Competition might helps to solve their problems in current problems but cooperation is the only way to build a bright future. so cooperation is the only thing to become successful. So only i'm personally telling in this complex world, cooperation is much better than competition.
