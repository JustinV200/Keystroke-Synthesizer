I often met this question do people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others, it is completely based on the people's mindset how they become happy. some people get happy by just archiving their personal goals and they do it by their own and doesn't want other to make him/her happy. most of the people get's happiness by archiving their own personal goals because it makes them feel better and it will motivate them to archive more goals in their life it will make life easier. 

Some people get happier by just getting others people happy. They always prefer others happiness yhan their happiness they get happier by seeing others happier. They help other people to srchive their goals and get's them to reach an higher stage in their life they always gets happier by just seeing others happiness. Sometimes they would get jealous on others and they would not help others or they will not help them. 

On comparing how people get happiness by if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others. People get's happiness on archiving their personal goals because it will become adictive and they will work more on their own works. But some people get happier by just making others happy. They would always have a pure heart and always wanted to help other people. It is completely based on people how they grow up. Both people want's to get happiness by archiving their goals and seeing other's archiving the goals.
