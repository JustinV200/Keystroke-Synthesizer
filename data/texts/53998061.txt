Human nature is social. As such, we are intrinsically connected to the rest of humanity. When others suffer, we as individuals suffer. We can only find true happiness, when we align our personal goals with the outside world.

Solely focusing on one's own personal pursuit of dreams and goals leads an individual toward an egocentric lifestyle, void of true interactions with the world. When a person is hyperfocused on only their own dreams, it is easy to forget the importance of a worldview.  Focusing on others, makes us better and more healthier individuals who are capable of connecting and empathizing with others. One may say that a person who works ambitiously towards their own goals, can obtain wealth that they may then use for charitable causes and once they do, they add to their level of happiness. This may be true, however, it is also true that this happiness is probably short-lived compared to what the individual actively participating in an activity may gain. This experience of sacraficing will ultimately provide them with an experience they can look back on, boosting their happiness whenever it comes to mind. This would differ from the individual who did good by contributing to a GoFundMe.  
     
Our own nature demands that we connect with others on a deeper level. So many of our mental health issues are built into the modern fabric of society.  So many of us are knees-deep into social media; forced to compare our accomplishments to others', all the while diminishing our own accomplishments and striving for bigger ones. We have become selfish and we hate ourselves for it. How can happiness be reached this way?
