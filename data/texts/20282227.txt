Materialism is an important part of modern life. It is one that is often criticized for many reasons. Is materialism really bad in and of itself? 

I do not believe materilism is a negative thing. However you can not center your life around it. I think this has led many people to feeling their lives are empty. There have been looking for meaning in all sorts of different areas some of which I worry could be quite harmful. I have seen people be attrached to totalitarian political philosphies which the history of the 2oth century has shown has caused massive numbers of dead, oppression and poverty. Some people seen to be attracted to cults of personality around well-known individuals not always directed involved in politics. This is something I do not understand and find bizarre.

People need something beyond materialism to find meaning in their life. I think religion or philsophy can provide this meaning.  Many people have a religious impulse if if they don't realize it. If they don't follow a religion this impulse can go into other areas. For examples for some environmentalism has become a religion. These type of people can be hard to comprise with since they are so zealous. On the other hand some religions can become too involved with politics. The religious message becomes secondary to the politics of the day. 

As a society grows wealthier materialism becomes more important.  Why should this not be enough? People can be happy with their possessions and wish to again more of them. The fact that people are not struggling to survive is a good thing.

I think the main problem with materialism is trying to center your life around it. This gives people an empty feeling since I believe they have a soul. You need to nourish your soul with religion or philosophy.
