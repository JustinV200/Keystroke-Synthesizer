Judging a book by it's cover isn't just a cautionary tale of yesteryear, but an intrinsically human trait of believing first what is seen before knowing anything of depth from the subject at hand. while such snap judgements may be important in specific circumstances for survival, when it comes to everyday observations, some say it is better to look and consider before drawing any conclusion. you must be careful to not fall for the trap of relying too heavily on visual images.

a person may first appear to be mired in poverty, but many wealthy people are frugal when it comes to clothes and personal possessions. an older woman might at first appear slow, and friendly, but she can sneak up and yank your ear as fast as a cobra over any perceived slight. 

this can also be applied to purchasing items. some items seem to appear to be high value, but are knockoffs, poorly made and a ripoff. but sometimes knockoffs have a superior quality and can be purchased cheaper. weighing the pros and cons instead of relying on immediate visual cues can make all the difference.

other people say, image matters most. someone who puts no thought into image will be sloppy, and lazy, but that varies more by personality than by valuing image. there are many highly dignified poor people and slovenly rich people. a value system does not necessarily have corresponding dollar values.

a dog may be fluffy and have a nice dog smile, but if you smell like the jerk neighbor dog, you just might get your finger bitten. is it fortunate or unfortunate that dogs don't simply judge based on the sight of a person? imagery has too much impact on the average person, but the smartest of the pack will think twice before choosing.
