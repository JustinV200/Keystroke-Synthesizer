Success can be achieved in a variety of ways. People achieve more success by cooperation as opposed to competition. 

First, cooperation allows for a growth mindset. When you are cooperating with others, you are learning from them and growing your own skills and knowledge. Competition may fuel or drive a specific need to complete a task. It may also, in the short term, drive a need for personal best, however, when that task is over that person is not left with skills to move them forward next time. They are relying on a drive to be the best or win instead of taking what others say and gaining skills or knowledge from them. Growing as a person through cooperation with others helps to acheive long term success.

Second, people achieve more success by cooperation because they are able to network and build relationships. Friendly competition can be fun in the workplace, but it does nothing to deepen a relationship with someone. When relationships are made and grown over time, it is personally fulfilling. From a business standpoint, it is good to grow your relationships because people see you as a team player. In the business world, alot of times it is not what you know, but who you know. Growing your network can be just as important in certain circumstances than growing personal knowledge. Cooperation helps to build those relationships.

In conculsion, people achieve more success by cooperation as opposed to competition. Competition can push you to do better in the short term, but cooperation allows for long term growth, both personally and relationally.
