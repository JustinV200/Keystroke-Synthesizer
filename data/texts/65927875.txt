I wonder if the creators of social medias ever thought about the negative effects people with body image disorders may experience while using their site. In todays society, media exposure is responsible for the increasing number of body dissatisfaction issues. The "perfect" images thats posted online has effects on some individuals as they compare themselves and evaluate their own body flaws. 
Some people might not agree with social media causing negative body image issues. Seeing images of what you inspire to look like could be motivational. Social media can promote positivity if you are viewing content that builds your body image.
Eventhough on social media people try to present the best version of themselves, you never know what is realistic. It is important to use social media in a positive way to avoid body images issues. Additionally, unfollow accounts that do not make you feel good. Instead, follow accounts that lift you. There are many accounts that you can follow that promote positive body image and does not make you feel like you have to adhere to beauty standards set by some people in society. There are many support groups that shift your mindset to positivity body image. Futhermore, you can use your own social media account to represent positive body images.
