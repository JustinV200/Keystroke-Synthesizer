How does the imagery around us affect our impressions? All over our society today, we are constantly seeing persuasive imagery. We see it in product packaging, commercials, ad banners, posters, and any other medium possible. Our eyes are drawn to the colorful packaging of our favorite junk food or even the innovative digital billboard in the middle of the city we live in. These images often have an everlasting effect on us, whether we realize it or not.

The imagery we deem as harmless affects people too much. Adverstisements are one of the main forms of imagery we see all of the time. All of those advertisements we see are meant to brand an image into our minds so that we are always aware of them. This makes us more likely to buy what is being advertised, meaning the advertisers are making money. It's all purposeful. Think about the classic and beloved drink Coca-Cola. What's the first thing that comes to mind? Probably that elegant, white writing of the name on that bold red background. That image sticks with us. The imagery that sticks the most is more likely to impact our decisions, perceptions, and our purchases. 

It is true that we can try to make a conscious effort to be aware of persuasive imagery but, it is extremely difficult to get away from these images. They are everywhere. Think about how often a Coca-Cola logo is in a magazine, or on a billboard, or on television, or even on our phones. When we are bombarded with a constant image, it is nearly impossible for it not to leave an effect on us. 

Our impressions of the world are always being influenced by the imagery around us. We are drawn in by popping colors, aesthetic displays, and satisfying arrangements of persuasive imagery. Because we have no choice but to look at this imagery all around us, we are far too affected by the images and impressions we see every day.
