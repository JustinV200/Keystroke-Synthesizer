Most of the people will be achieve more success by competition. Without competition, they will not get success in their life. I have lot of competition in my cooperation. In my organization, every month end we will get appraise and prize rewards based on their performance and competition level.
I am working as supervisor in my organization. I am working in healthcare industry. Their will be lot of competition and goals to overcome and sustain in the cooperation. I am working hard to get succes for every month. Mostly my team will get rewards every month. As well my team members will give full support to achieve success in the field.
My organization will provide some rewards based on the individual performance and team performance. I have work hard to get success. Every three years I will get higher position based on the achievements. So I would like to finish my schedule with perfect manner and on time. Without any delay I will complete all my works as well I will focus my team members to complete the task within deadline. It will be helpful to increase our track record. Based on the track record, we will get some salary increment and position appraisal. So peoples can achieve more success based on the competition. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity to share my thoughts about competition.
