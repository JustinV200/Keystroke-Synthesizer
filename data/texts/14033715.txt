Hmm...Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?  I don't think it should. I say this because, each and everyone of us, I believe, are materialistic in some way.  Maybe we collect figurines. Maybe we love to show off in the best possible clothing attire.  Maybe we spoil our animals and treat them like our babies...I know that I do.  

I believe that if someone works hard, that they should be able to spend their money however they seem fit.  I don't see why it is necessary to judge someone if they have fancy clothes, a fancy car, a beautiful house, or keep themselves kept in their appearance.  Now, I will agree, that there are people in this world that like to show off their posessions and that's their choice. Feel free to do so, but don't expect everyone to agree with your decision. 

I grew up living with my grandparents.  My grandfather made decent money and he hated to part with it, unless it was something that he wanted for himself.  Was he materialistic?  I would say that he was, at least in some ways.  He always had the nicest car/truck and was always spending money on things that he wanted and enjoyed.  He did enjoy showing off certain things as well.  

I believe that modern society should be more worried about themselves, than being worried about what others spend their money on. I've always heard the phrase, "You can't take it with you when you die."  I guess in some way, I live by this.  If there's something that I want, I will attain said item.  

Materialism is just a part of our society, the norm.  Spending money keeps our nation going, in a way.  It keeps the mom and pop shops open and keeps big retail stores going.  I see nothing wrong with that at all.  It's a way of life. Live, spend, and accumalate...repeat. 

Thank you for your time!
