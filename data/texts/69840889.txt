I don't think modern society should be that critisized for materialism because we live in a very divided society socially. Our belongings and purchases show everyone who we are as people and where we stand in society. When we get enough money to be able to purchase expensive items, we feel good about ourselves and feel like we have meaning in life.

I think that materialism makes us work harder in our jobs too. It fuels our need to succeed because that then leads to promotions and other means to be able to afford the lavish things we crave. Without materialism, we wouldn't have the drive to do better in our careers. Whenever people talk about why they have the jobs they have, it's always either for money or for passion. However, I think those who say they have their careers for passion also do it for the money becuase those jobs are typically high paying.

However,  I do think that our society is a little too materialistic and we need to start thinking about other things. Being very materiaistic makes people become self centered and in the world we live in, we need to really start thinking about others instead of just us. It's a detrimental way for our society to live especially when people are dying just for being different.
