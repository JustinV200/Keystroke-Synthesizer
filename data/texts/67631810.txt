All of the peoples are running behind the money and graduations to construct their own life in their society. Some peoples would says negative thoughts about it. If peoples were satisfied with their money needs then they can achieve their life needs. Sometimes making money and complete Graduation should not come easily. Peoples have to work very harder to achieve it. 
I took my friend as an example. In that starting days of his teenage life no one would respect him because of his situation in his life. He always took negative thoughts about the peoples who should not took stand to him. But that mean time I took a stand and said "Money and graduation would change your entire life. After that every people who should not respect you will show respect on you." Then he realize that graduation and money making gives peoples respect and worked hard towards it.
Now he transformed him as a lawyer, because of his education. At the mean time, He got respected because of his graduation. After realised it, He is running toward his work and money needs. Because of it he turned as a materialistic man and because of that every peoples are showing respect to him. So, because of the reason the modern society was more materialistic and got criticized by most of the peoples.
