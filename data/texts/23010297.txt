     While some people believe that competition is the best way to succeed in life, others believe that cooperation is more effective.  I believe that cooperation is the more effective solution.
     Simply put, one person will not usually know as much about any particular topic or situation as a group of people will.  This is due to the vastly different experiences that different people have over the course of their life.  By tapping into that pool of knowledge, a person who uses cooperation will normally be at an advantage by having gained more knowledge about a topic versus relying on only their own experience.  Also, by cooperating with others there will be many more varied ideas on how to handle a situation.   People of different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities, religions and genders will help you to see a problem through a different lens.  Finally, by cooperating with others you will be able to have support and be able to feel like you are part of a team.   All of these reasons make cooperation a superior stragedy when compared to competition.
     While competition has some merits, like increased motivation, it is still one person versus many people.  Competition can lead to more stress, as the pressure of succeeding is felt by one person.  It can also lead to strife in the workplace or in your personal life.   With competition, if you win, the other side loses and vice-versa.  With cooperation, if you win, everyone wins.  
     Cooperation is a superior stragedy in life compared to competition due to the advantages of knowledge and ideas of a group versus an individual.
