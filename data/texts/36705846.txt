Co-operation and competition are the two key points of success. People need both of them to succeed in everything. But, there is always one thing is better than the other thing. It will be one setp ahead of the another one. Some people will say, competition is important and others will say co-operation is important. In that case also, one thing will have more support than the another one. I believe competition helps a little bit more than the co-operation for achieve success.


Co-operation will help only when we form a group of people to win another group or a single person. It won't help when we are alone as no one will be there to help and cooperate with us. But competition will help us to achieve success in every aspects as we will have competition with a single person or a group. It will give strength to our heart and mind to achieve the victory, it will help us to try every possibilities to win against other people.


So, competition have a better place for people in my heart than co-operation. It gives success easily than co-operation. People will get succeeded in achieving success by following the competitional way in their life.
