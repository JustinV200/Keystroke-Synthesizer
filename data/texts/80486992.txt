      Happiness is basically a state mind. In addition, true happiness comes from within yourself. happiness is a sense of well being, joy or contenment. when people are feeling safe, successful or lucky, they feel happiness. I think people are more likely to be happy on their personal goals than on the happiness of others.
      To be happier, you should focus on yourself so you can focus on others also. If you don't starts with you, your focus on the others will be containmented by neediness, fear of rejection, drama, being rude, getting anger, a desire to control and frequently feeling disregarded,disrespected, discarded. One need to be satisfied with whatsover he's got, and it all start from the inside of you. In other side to be just happy you should focus on yourself and if you want to be happier then you should focus on thers, because there is no happiness without family, friends and a partner.
        happiness only find when one is at peace with oneself.  To be at peace with oneself, you've got to accept when you are, to work on your own damn self. One goals to be satisfied with whatsover he's got, and it all starts from the inside of you.
