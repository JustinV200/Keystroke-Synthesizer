In a bid to make life worth the while, mankind began to excavate the earth surface in search of raw materials. These raw materials have been fashioned into several things like gadgets, musical equipments, clothings and several other amazing products. Mankind has achieved its aim of making life enjoyable through raw materials. 

However, there is a ligering debte about man's love for materialism. Some people believe the modern society has become too obsessed with materialism and I support this notion. I think the modern society is in love with material things and have lost meaning about our very existence here on earth. It is often said that one cannot serve two masters at a time. The love for material things like designers clothes, luxury phones, shoes and several other high end material things have pushed man to commit all sorts of crimes. 

The modern society has become too attached to material things to the extent that the young are willing to do about anything if it means they are rewarded with high end gadgets. The average human across the world has adopted a hedonistic lifestyle because of excessive love for material things. 

Too, several crimes across the youthful demography have been reported to have direct or indirect link to materialism. the young engage in illegal trades to raise money to acquire some material things they long for. 

The love for materialism has led to crimes and several other misdemenor, however, one cannot imagine what the world would be without these beautiful material things. materialism has its pros and cons but the modern society need to mitigate its excessive attchment to material things. 

There is more to life than material things.
