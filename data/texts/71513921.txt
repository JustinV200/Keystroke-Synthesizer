I absolutely believe that impressions have way too much of an effect on people. I don't know how many stories I've heard about people getting ripped off by a celebrity who was endorsing a product or service. They think because the celebrity or influencer is promoting the product it must be good. WRONG! It very rarely is in my experience. I also fall victim to flashy packaging. I will usually pick the item that is brighter or more colorful thinking its the better product when really I should be looking at ingredients. 
Regardless of my belief I'm not sure much can be done to prevent this all too common phenomena. I wish celebrities, influencers, politicians, and public figures would realize the wrong they are doing because it is incredibly unethical in my opinion. People take advantage of the situation for money, power, or fame. To be honest, it seems smart too however. After all there isn't a law saying bright packaging is illegal. That entertainers can't promote products regardless of how they really feel about the product.  This is how I'm sure many people feel but I hope they know it is still morally wrong to dupe people. 
Some would argue that it is up to the consumer to do their due dilligence and research the product better, rather than take someone at their word. This is what I've had to resort too. After all it is my money that they want. I might as well make sure it's what I want regardless of who says I need it. In conclusion, I've decided I will remain cautious of mistaken appearances for the rest of my life and I'd advise the same for anyone. I will abide by my inner moral compass rather than be steered by greed.
