What do you beleive that a person's happness is focused on his/her personal goals or on the happiness of others? I perfer focusing on the personal goals for happness.

Do you always having new dreams and new goals for anything? Will you happy when you got what you want? Yes, I would be happy for a little dream I had came true and a little goal I reached. when I was a little in China, my parents never bought a doll from store for our 4 sisters in my childhood. As a girl, I wanted to have a dool. My mom helpped me to make a dool by myself, and I made a stuffed girl by my self and mom's help. That was only doll I had in my childhood. I was happy and proud of it. I setted up a goal to go to a college to have a office job, I had the lowest sccor limit for the exam, but I got a college accepted in China. I was very happy I got accepted. I made best effort in the college, and had a job sitting in an office like I dreamed after the college graduated. I felt the happiness on what I appoached.

How can you feel the happiness on your goals? How can you be sure you always reach the goals to get what you want? Make it natural and simple: to do somthing you had a happy thought in your mind at a moment; make your goals little by little and reach them little by little.

You would be happy when you reach a little goal you had. Also I beleive you are the person would be happy on other's happiness.
