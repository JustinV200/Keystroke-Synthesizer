When you look at the question of wether cooperation or competion is a better way to acchieve success you have to look at both sides. What works for one doesn't work for the other. Though for me I would have to say it would be competition.

For my reasoning behind this I would have to talk a bit about my past history with group projects. They have never worked out for me. I have some how always ended up as the impromptu leader and that is where my nightmare begins. The others in the group either don't do the work they are assigned and then I have to do it myself or do so poorly on their part I had to fix it. This while a pain for me, helped me to push myself. Thus I came to understand that cooperation leads to complacency that comes with extra heads as this means that they can slack because someone else can handle it. It became a game of me verses the groups that did have cooperation between members.

With competition I had to force myself to better myself. A person can not always count on that there would be someone to catch or help them when they fall. Make it or break it is what I found to be the key. If you fail on your own then you know where you messed up, with other people added to the equation you have a chance for passing the blame. Passing the blame will be come a habit that we lead to other problems down the road where you might end up in a situation of no return. Having an "extra" set of hands to use will only weaken yours. Relying on others will only leave you hanging when you finally have to be on your own.

So in conclusion ompetition is something we as humans have been doing in some way shape or form for generations. This is something that will not change anytime soon. Wether it is competion over food, partners, or that promotion at the office... in the end one can only rely on ones self.
