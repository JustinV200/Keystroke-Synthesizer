I think more success is achieved by cooperation. Competition causes cheating, cutting corners, and other unethical means to win. It also creates hostility amongst people. Instead of bringing people together to achieve success for all involved, it creates division and stifles innovation. When people don't work together for the greater good, it causes selfishness and more people tend to lose out. 

Cooperation leads to more people being successful and more people benefitting. It leads to more ethical practices and brings people together for the greater good instead of just trying to make oneself successful. Cooperation leads to stronger relationships with your peers and more lasting success overall. This is better for innovation and progress for everyone, while competition tends to keep most people behind with only a few getting ahead. 

Some competition isn't all bad, but it has it's place and shouldn't be prioritized over cooperations with peers. Cooperation is what will get us further and have more meaningful lives and success. Everyone benefits and more ethical behaviors are likely. Some people might be successful by competition, but usually not ethically or in the long run. People who gain success by cooperation usually have long lasting success and help others to be successful too.
