If you asked me this 5+ years ago I would have a completely different answer to this question but as of now, I believe that cooperation is the way to achieve success. I am a software developer and I used to be a hermit at work and keep to myself and do everything on a project myself. I never thought anyone else would work up to my standards and that if I "wanted it done right, I would do it myself". I started to see people and groups around me completing more tasks, moving ahead and getting more praise for the work they were doing and decided to try to offload some of the tasks of the projects to other people and I was assamed at how much faster we'd get things done.

Moving to a more coopoerative work environment wasn't exactly flaweless though, it's not like a light switch. When I first started I, again, kept to myself and my ideas and thoughts I ran with without consulting the other people I was working with. This caused issues when we came back together to combine our tasks, we were not on the same page. I quickly learned that if you're not willing to communicate, then a cooperative environment can be just as slow as an independant/competitive one. Once we setup meetings, dicussions, open lines of communications with each other is when we started to be more on the same page and able to get tasks done fast and to a high standard. 

Esentially, I used to be a very competitive, lone wolf, kind of person. I thought I could do it all, but if you're will to trust other people around you and have good open communication, I feel that at their peaks, cooperation will beat competition every time. If you're still looking at your work as a competition between your co workers, I think you should reconsider.
