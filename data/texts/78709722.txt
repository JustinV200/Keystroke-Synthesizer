Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Criticism of modern society is imperative to the advancement of humanity. 

The author's defintion of materialism as acquiring possessions and spending money. This is perhaps too broad reaching of a definition to use in an argument about whether we should criticize modern society as a whole. The criticism of modern society from place of morality, in particular, would certainly condemn materialism and the overreaching affect that it has had on the world at large,

Materialism on an individual level, however, is harder to criticize. While the author does not define "stuff", much of it may be essential to the individual, in which case criticism would come from a place of ascetic dogma rather than an attempt to make the act of living more efficient. Materialism is not unique to humans, but it is innate to us in that we want the best tools to survive whatever environment we may be in at that time.

If materialism was completely useless to us as a species, we would have probably discarded it by now. Instead, we have idolized materialism in a way that allows us to live next to it comfortably. Modern society should be criticized, but even that criticism becomes a material object to be acquired, traded, or spent. 

The fabric of materialism does pose significant problems to society in that it has manifested in most work being contracted to coporations and agencies whose specific purpose is to limit expenditure while maximizing profits, the final level of materialism. The core component in the fabric of materialism being the workers themselves. 

Modern society is as much of a material posession as any tangible good. The fact  that we spend most of our energy producing stuff leads one to the conclusion that we are the stuff.
