Happiness is a feeling of fullfillment and content with oneself. This does not in anyway imply that one can not draw happiness from making others happy but there is a saying that says you can not pour from an empty cup.I strongly believe that statement is as true as it comes and people should focus on themselves first before focusing on the next person.

If you derive happiness from achieveing all your set life goals or by simple things like achieving one goal at a time or maybe even seeing yourself on the right track towards achieving the said goals, go for it without any guilt of what other people think or feel. It is very important to be able to be happy and content yourself before now extending the same outwards.

Happiness is a feeling I believe every single person should get to experience atleast three quaters of their lives, it's a feeling like no other for sure. It comes with so much calmess and peace that if derived from a genuine place can make the world a very good place, a livable place infact.

In conclusion I can say that happiness yes can be derived from making other people happy but it'll have to start from an individual. So for me happiness is more likely to come from one focusing on their goals and achieving them altogether.
