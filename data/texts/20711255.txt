When you think of acheiving goals and climbing the rungs of corporate ladders or being a successful business owner/executive you might believe that being highly competitive is the only way to get from A to B. I'd like to challenge that thought process within this paper. 

There's a saying in the creative business owner community: "Community over competition." It's often followed by "a rising tide lifts all boats." To me this reigns true, in my 8.5 years as a small business owner I have found that my business is most successful when I have cooperation between myself and other like-minded business owners within my local and national communities. We are able to bounce ideas off of each other, we have the ability to encourage one another during both tough and joyous times and provide each other with the general feeling of being a part of a community. Being a small business owner can be isolating and without a sense of community you're more likely to experience burn out, general fatigue, and a potential disdain for your industry more quickly than with.

I realize that this can be taken to the extreme, people (other newer business owners) will likely try to take advantage of this kindness and will expect you to "spill" your trade secrets or what's worked for your business. This isn't a requirement to cooperate with others within your industry, there will always be "that person" in any industry. You have full autonomy over what you choose to share/provide with others.

In summation, I highly appreciate cooperation over a more competitve environment and believe it provides a higher success rate. It helps to not breed insecurity, animosity, and mitigates risk of early burn out within your industry. I'd love to know your thoughts after reading this.
