National alliance to end Homelessness is one of the organiztion which is helping the homeless in any way and people like these are working for the betterment of the humanity, not for personal gains and happy in their helpful way.

The vital part of happiness dervies from the being helpful to other, you cam find happiness in succes but it will run out eventually because there is always something you want more and somehow it will turn into only succession and competition. People living for others always have something to be happy about and to live for.
