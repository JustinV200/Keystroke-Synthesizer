Now I am going to write eassy  about the people achieve more success by competition. In this world there is one universal law is exist that is " Survival of the fittest". Which means the ctreature who having all abilities to win the life race are only able to live or achieve success in this worls. This is called as Darwins law of nature.  Every human in this world having all and unquie speciality in themselves. Who find their capability and utilizes in this competitive world only became sucess.
For example I am a 27 year old female who having very good talent in dancing. But I am not expose my talent to this world untile the day when my friend teased my inner ability. She is my friend from my childhood. We used to dance practice in our house. Suddently she teased about my dancing talent. We argued and agreed to take a challenge that who will be more successive dancer and earn award in our dance school will be a winner.
We both practised a lot and work harder to achieve our goal. I take this challenge in very serious manner and practice harder and learn gynostic to have perfect cut finish. At the competion I won and got awarded as best dancer of my dancing school and acadamy. According to me there is only one way to attain our goal is dedication.
