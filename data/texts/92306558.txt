      Way too many times things are not as they appear, what we think of things from thier appearance can be misleading. One could easily overlook how things really are. Staying connect to reality can become a challenge.

        Often times we make a list when we go to the store to buy groceries. Once we get to the store we run in to deals on items that have been marked down to display savings. When in reality the intention is the store trying to move merchandise. The atempt that is present is to sway the shopper into spending money they had not set out to spend. In this, the shopper spends more money than planned and the merchandise gets moved.

        The key is to stay focused on what your intentions were from the begenning and if there happens to be an item that one planned to purchase and can get two for one for it or better, one will not be led astray in the purchase. In this I will not be spending more than I set out to spend.

          Some would argue that to be the most effective would be to jump all over any savings presented not knowing that they are being led by other peoples intentions to reduce inventory, with offers of store wide savings and discounts, amoung other offers.

           The overall projection of what to do financially with your own spending is to not be misled by the actoins of others appearances, that try to take from your pocket to benefit themselves. One should stay focused on the task at hand and be more effecient in saving on your own purchase intentions, to gain financial success.
