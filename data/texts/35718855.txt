         Everyone has unique goal in their life. And follow many ways to commit or achieve it. These or one kind of people . The another kind is feel happy when see others happy. Both type of people are enjoy their own way of life.
        The first type depends on own happiness. They concentrate on their work. How to stay connect with work, keep connect with other people in work, manage all dificulties, face everything strongly and keep promises in our work. This kind of thoughts always give a positive energy to solve anything and keep motivating themselves. In this time period everyone live like this. They only expect their own happiness without expect their surroundings . They don't even consider anything. But they don't harm to anyone. They do their work and get happiness from that.
        The second kind of people seems very rare in this time period. In olden days the whole world lives likes that. We read many historical related it. In those time people are happy when they see others success and happiness. They celebrate the success of other person as their own. It makes a healthy and happy sourrounding. 
        In conculsion people more likely to be happy with achieve their personal goals. This is not a wrong thing. When they do their things and get succeed without harm to anyone. In my opinion people are more connected with own happiness rather than expecting any other person.
