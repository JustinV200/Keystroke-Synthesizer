   I believe modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. In fact it has been an ecomic blessing for mankind. We, as humans, have gone from poor hunter scavangers to our modern incarnation of a race that has achieved an unequaled standard of living that has raised billions out of poverty.
   The advent of capitalism has been the driving force in our economic development. Starting with Adam Smith's invisible hand theory we as a society have become progressively better off financially thanks to the magic of the free enterprise system. Now people can start their own businesses in the hopes of securing a financially secure life. That inevitably leads to materialism as it is natural to to want to benefit from the fruits of your labor. Everyone wants to lead a better life according to their own thoughts and preferences. Some people want to spend time doing things while others want to have things. Either way it costs money and the effort to get the necessary funds has created untold wealth across the globe, which has lifted man way above his mere ability to "scratch" out a hard, meagre living from the fallow grounds of centuries gone by.
   There are always excesses in the things people do, in this case owning material possesions, but without the materialistic instinct the world's economy would not grow and more people would be poor and our standard of living would be much lower. We are, for good or bad,  a consumerist society but I believe the economic benefits outweigh the social negatives.
