Yes, I think that people are affected by what they see in advertisements and media. Images and expressions change how people perceive things. It can be a real problem because we don't focus on substance. It's just that too often these days entertainers and celebirities sell you soemthing that is just not true. They sell you an idea of who they are or waht they want you to think they are. Politicians do it as well. You can't just accept whatever they say. It's absurd.

We need to go back to basics and focus solely on substance. We need to take a long hard look at ourselves. And yes at our culture. It's just too superficial. We elected Trump who is the first reality TV show president. But reality Tv is not real, it's a myth. It is leading us to doing choices because they sound good but don't actually work. 

Social media has only made things worse. People jsut go with what cauuses the most retweets or likes or whatever. It's insulting. The deep stuff gets lost. It's just superficiality and it's fake. And it's making us dumber and sadder. We keep comparing ourselves to unattainable goals. I hate it.
