Are people happier if they focus on their own goal or on the happiness of others? I ask myself that question a lot. Everyone has different views or beliefs about this topic. My belief is that people are more likely to be happier if they focus on the happiness of others. I have good reasoning to back up my claims.
      To start off with, people are more likely to affect others. Say if a person you knew or saw was unhappy, despressed, anxious, etc., that will also affect how you think or feel. For example, my bestfriend was going through a hard time because her mother had passed away, she became very depressed, and hurt. It is like everytime I had talked to her, I also was feeling her pain. I was sympathetic towards her. I also became very depressed for a short while. It made my daily activities harder. Sometimes I didn't even want to get out of bed. Although achieving your goals will make you happy, you also have to think about the people you surround yourself with. If you surround yourself with negative people than you too, will also start to feel negative. This is why i believe that you will be happier if you focus on the happiness of others. It is like a chain reaction. Negative people give off negative energy while positive people give off positive energy. Pursing ones goals is a good, but while your persuing your goal you will also be effected by the people you are around. 
        In conclusion, people are much happier if they focus on the happiness of others. Just remember to surround yourself with positive people. This is what determines your happiness.
