Happiness is a hard topic since everyone's definition of being "happy" is quite different. As humans we are all very different individuals, does that difference stem from what makes us happy? Is it being happy about our own goals or being happy about others success and happiness? This is a topic that has been roaming around for a long time since many people believe that there is a "key" to happinness and success, while I believe that it depends on the person.

As I believe people tend to be more selfish and always tend to focus more on themselves I will argue that people are more likely to be happy when they focus on their own personal goals. I can aslo see how there are some people who might be happier through the happinness of others but in my opinion it is rare or circumstantial. By circumstantial I mean a mother, sibling, grandparents they usually tend to be happy for their families success. 

Most of the time people hate to be left out, which means that they don't get happy by others success or happiness unless they are part of it. In other cases, people might not share the good news or possible good news with people in fear of them being jealous and giving them bad energy. Therefore, I believe that people get happier by focusing on their own goals or success.
