Whether we like it or not, all of us are affected by the world around us. We make purchases based on advertising.  We seek out people who look like us, or like we want to look. It's a fact that is primal and inescapable. 

But the real question is, why is that a problem? In some cases, no. When we buy a product based on its packaging, what does it hurt? Our lives change little whether we buy the spaghetti sauce in the non-descript jar, or if we buy the one that looks authentically Italian. And, once we buy the product, we learn if we like what is on the inside, which will influence our decision to buy it the next time. 

The problem, truly, comes when we translate this idea to people rather than objects. When we choose who we listen to based solely on our comfort level, their appearance, their fame or other outside appearance, we miss important views in our society. We miss the richness that comes with diversity and many viewpoints. And, we can be easily led astray. 

Never has this been more apparent than during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were many flashy people out there, often proclaiming they were doctors and spreading misinformation like wildfire. And the true scientists, who had previously not been public figures, were thrust in the spotlight and expected to compete. The result was the less discerning community received faulty information that resulted in thousands of deaths. 

It's natural to be easily swayed by something flashy. It's in our nature. And advertisers, celebrities and politicians are smart. They know these tactics work. So it becomes a matter of training- of always asking the questions when someone tells you to just believe something without evidence. It could save your life, or at least your spaghetti.
