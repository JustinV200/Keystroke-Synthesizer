It is my belief that people achieve more meaningful success through the power of cooperation. Although competition and rivalry may drive someone to work hard and achieve certain goals, their reasoning behind that achievement is to beat someone else, and it is no longer about creating a successful, high-level product; it is about tearing the other person down. In contrast, when two team members are encouraged to work together, they are being asked to lift each other up and both parties will achieve success when the goal is reached. Working together leads to a greater level of success. 

A team based environment drives people to higher levels of success because people are encouraged to help each other find their strengths. People are utilized for the skills they excel at. Additionally, they are given the opportunity to learn and grow from teammates who hold other skills, allowing for greater personal growth. When people work together, they don't just succeed at a task, they learn and grow from the process of completing it. 

In a workplace where competition is encouraged, the parties involved are isolated from each other. They might have complementary strengths but will never discover this because they do not work together. They work against each other. Success may come, but it may come at the cost of higher effort and those who achieve it will not be doing so with a high level of personal growth. 

The differences between competition and cooperation are stark. Meaningful success is more than achieving a task; it is achieving a task and learning from it, growing into a person who can repeat that success with greater ease the next time it comes up. It is much easier for a person to do this in an environment that encourages cooperation, where sharing and teamwork are at the forefront of their values.
