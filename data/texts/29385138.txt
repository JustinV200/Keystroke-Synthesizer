Many have different ideas about what brings happiness to a person. Some feel that focusing on their personal goals will bring true happiness. But I believe  that true happiness can be found by helping and giving to others. 

A person can experience many troubles in this world. It can be problems from poor health, finances, and family. Dealing with them can consume a lot of time and can be draining. Unfortunately, other people are going through similar problems as well. I personally can be consumed with stress over my problems. But I find that when I help someone, or give them a gift, it takes some of the focus off myself. Actually, I get an inner happiness when I see them respond to the help. I've had times when that person came to my aid later.

An individuals' personal problems are important, and one shoudn't have a competition over whose problems are greater. Its important to focus on oneself and ones goals. A person needs goals to map how they will live their lives. Meeting those goals do bring a measure of joy. A person shouldn't ignore themselves as that is unhealthy. But helping others put personal problems in perspective. Everyone is going through something, and we should help each other. And taking time to focus on others can show ourselves the best we can be. That brings happiness.

There are many ways to find happiness. Achieving a dream or meeting a goal are some ways. But I find that the greatest happiness can come from helping others.
