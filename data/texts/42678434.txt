                              Happiness is the human feeling one gets on accomplishing  something or achiving something which one thrives for. It may be an achivement, a dream or something on which we have given our every bit of struggle to achive it. The feeling of happiness makes a human being releived of all the stresss that he comes across in his daily walks of life.some get happiness on achieving their own dreams and some find happiness in others happiness.
                              I  am such sort of a person who finds happiness when i make an effort to fulfill someones dreams and thus make them happier and being part of their happiness.
                              I helped a friend of mine by supporting him in his interest for coding by offering him my old pc , the study material that I prepared and collected and cleared all his doubts while he was learning coding. The happiness I got after he became a succesful  coder and got placed in an MNC was just out of words to express. The joy and happiness of being the part or reason of someones happiness cannot be measured or expressed in words.
                               While some say in this fast pace world there are no feelings for others happiness and its only using someone for a need rather than a feeling. I strongly disagree on this as i feel humans if connected more mentally will lead to a better society.It will lead to a positive competitive spirit  among people thus bringing the best out of them and in a whole to the society around us .
                               Finally I would like to conclude that we should search for our own happiness but also being part of someones happiness would make us even more happy and proud of ourselves in the long run.
