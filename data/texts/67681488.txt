There are two type of peoples on the word.
some strongle belive cooperation is important to win the game or achieve any golas.
And some people think competition make motivation for them, so they belive competion is important to win the game or achieve the goals.
This all are their perspective.    
 
But competition and cooperation both are  important.
in school any group event or any games like cricket, foot ball, the games need cooperation  and same time competion also important, if competion make them motivation, but same time without cooperation they can't win the cricket game, one man score wast for team game.  
In studies they separate all the students in gread bassed on their marks, it is just for a competion,  in the exam call we can't use cooperation, we only use competion with time. 
so people achiev in both of the competion and cooperation.
competion make them motivation,
cooperation make them team spirit.
If the the two join perfect mix they definitly achieve their goals.

 they all need both so dont go with any one of this two, cooperation is must same time competion alos important dont loss the sprit competion.
that is the best way to achieve all people's goals.
people understand will happy in their goals
