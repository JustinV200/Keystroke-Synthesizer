Although pursuing one's personal goals does provide a sense of accomplishment and fulfulment, it would appear that a greater sense of happiness occurs when people focus on the happiness of others. When we focus on our own personal goals and accomplishments, and are successful in obtaining them, then there is no doubt that it makes us happy. But the happiness is ephemeral, because the next thing that people do is immediately look forward to the next goal that they want to accomplish. The joy of the accomplishment is only fleeting, and then we feel unfulfilled again.

When we focus on the happiness of others, then the potential to be happy is almost unlimited. If our loved ones succeed and we allow ourselves to encourage them and share in the joy of their success, then we ourselves feel happy. If, instead of comparing our life situation to our friends' situations, we applaud our friends when they do well, rather than trying to have or do more then them, then there's a sense of inner peace and contentment that wouldn't be possible if we were focused on trying to surpass them. It may sound ironic, but by focusing on the happiness of others instead of ourselves, we are able to attain a more permanent state of happiness.

Because the state of happiness is tied to emotion, it is transitory and always fluctuating. Since human emotions are continually changing, then to allow our sense of happiness to be entirely dependant on our own goals and accomplishments ultimately sets us up for brief periods of joy upon attainment of those goals and accomplishments, which then quickly dissipate. Where if we remain focused on the happiness of those around us, such as friends, colleagues, or even strangers, then the potential to remain happier more of the time is greatly increased. 

In conclusion, as ironic as it might sound, it appears that people would  likely to be more happy if they remain focused on the happiness of others, rather than themselves.
