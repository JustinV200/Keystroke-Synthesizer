      Success at work is a primary goal. No one wants to fail. There are many ways to achieve success such as through intense competition or utilizing cooperation. Some might argue that competition is the best way to achieve success but in reality, that isn't the case. Cooperation is powerful and drives people more than competition.
       While competition can drive people to work since they want to win, it creates a culture of secrecy and rivalry. It doesn't foster idea-sharing. It might work for short-term success but it will not sustain long-term success. Cooperation creates a culture of camaraderie. It fosters and nurtures idea-sharing. The term "two heads are better than one" is true for a reason. For this reason, cooperation will allow people to achieve more success. This can be seen with film and cinema, for example. Most works of film have more than one writer. They work together cooperatively to create their work. They brainstorm and let the ideas flow. They receive feedback and can adjust from there. This is how good ideas become great. 
         Success can be achieved in many ways, including through intense competition and through cooperation. Some might argue that competition is the best way to motivate people to success, but that is not the case. Cooperation creates a culture where ideas flourish. Cooperation will always be better to achieve long-term, significant results.
