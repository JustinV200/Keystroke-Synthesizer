People are more happy when they focus on personal goals. Personal growth is measurable and most apparent to the individual acheiving it. Humans are inherently selfish. By being selfish one can become self sufficient and better off, freeing them up to have the capability of supporting others and being altruistic. 

While it's true that altruism leads to happiness for some, according to Mazlow's Hierarchy of needs, people need to fulfill multiple individual needs before they can reach self-actualization. Shelter/having a home, having enough food to feed oneself, and love are all significant needs that humans need to fulfill. If one cannot provide for themselves, how can they be expected to help others? For some, self-actualization consists of altruism and philanthropy. Examples of this include Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, MLK Jr, and Ghandi. Usually the process of self-actualization comes at later points in one's life, it's what gives meaning to one's life, a higher objective/goal that people strive to achieve. This varies depending on people's stage of life, different household's while growing up, people's perspective, financial situation, etc. Regardless, pursuing one's personal goals gives one the financial/time freedom to help others and their happiness.

To be clear, altruism and helping others does lead to happiness; however, to maximize one's happiness, people should prioritize their own goals and growth. In fact, helping and spending time with others is a selfish thing. Humans are social beings that need to talk and interact with others.
