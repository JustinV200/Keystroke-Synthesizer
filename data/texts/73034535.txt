The best way to achieve success is through cooperation. At work cooperating with others allows one to feel close with their colleagues, which creates a happier work environment. If you are constantly competing with your co-workers, then you will being to view them as the enemy. This will lead to tension within the workplace, and it will make it so co-workers are less prone to work together when needed. 

When your employees are happy, they produce better results. If they are constantly competing for a promotion, for instance, then whomever doesn't receice it will obviously be upset. An unhappy employee will not be as productive as a sastified one. So, while the one who gets the promotion might be more productive, it will lead to decreased productivity in others. 

Cooperation doesn't only help in the workplace, of course. Depending on the activity, cooperation leads to better results than competiton. For example, in team sports, it's very important to work with your teammates. If you're constantly competing against the others in your team, it could lead to trouble once you're in a match. Your teammates might not be as willing to pass you the ball, for instance, if they have a poor opinion of you. You and your team can't sucessfully win a game if you can't work together. 

Overall, cooperation is most important for the success of a group. Individually, it can vary. Fierce competition can lead to individual successes; however, cooperation often leads to the success of a group of people. Therefore, cooperation leads to more success for more people over competition.
