Yes, the images and impressions have too much effect on people. People try to impress others in a direct way sometimes and sometimes in an indirect way. They want others to be impressed by their activities, especially the opposite genders. Don't know whether it's because of the brain or hormone, but it make people more energetic and active.

People not only trying to impress others by their activities, they are trying to attract others by remaining silent in some situations, they may be negative impacts sometimes. Some use it in positive ways and some uses it in negative ways. Good people uses it for the good cause and bad people uses it to attract others and uses them to threat others in any form.

The thing is, others are get impressed by these people's images. Different colors attracts us in different ways based on the place where they were used. Like that only, the people showing different colors at different situations and showing their true color at the end, by that time we wouldv'e got cheated and lost what we could not have. People should be more alert if someone shows unwanted love or affection towards them and protect themselves from these spammers.
