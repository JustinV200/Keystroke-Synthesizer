      Why does having things make us happy? Is it because we like pretty things? Maybe we feel a need to fill a void in our life because something else is missing? Perhaps we need the newest hot item to fit in and be accepted? Having materialistic things does not make us better people and may only fill a void for a short period of time before we have to spend more money to aquire more things. 
      Most people I know like to decorate their homes with pretty things and things they like, I know I do as well. But, there comes a point where we have too much stuff. That stuff ends up in a storage untit or donated to a charity. It is alright to own things and keep things you like, but the goal is to not purchase too many possesions. Too many items can cause stress, discomfort, anxiety, clutter and make us overwhelmed. Spending too much money on materialistic things can cause problems in relationships and bill paying as well.  Name brand clothing is another materialistic thing, some people stick to brands they love and will buy the newest handbag, watch, phone, etc that comes out even though they might not be able to pay their rent that month. 
       We should fill our homes with only special items that we love, wear our clothing until it no longer fits or is damaged, drive our car until it is no longer repairable, use our cell phones until they no longer work, even if it is cracked or broken. I think we should be criticized for spending money on things we dont need. I think more people should focus their spending on paying off past due bills or credit cards that may be maxed out, or doctor bills that we let sit and forget about. We should cook and eat meals at home more often. Save our money for future goals. In all reality, we work hard to make the money, we should keep it and use it for good purchases, not unnecessary.
