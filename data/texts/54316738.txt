In this modern world most of the people prefer competition to achieve the success compared  cooperation. But very few of the peoples in this world only recognize or accepts the success can also achieved by cooperating others idea .In starting I'm also recommends the competition methond but when I'm getting started to realizes that is not only the way to access victory . Now a days many peoples ready to compete with others to taste the fruit of victory. I think it is not worse to cooperate with others idealogy . Till now few of the negative minded peoples says it is worst way to achieve success but they are definitely fools and they are not ready to accept the reality. But that is not their fault . Recently many people accomplished many missions and getting their reward for their team work and that is enough to achieve their life time ambition. I prefer co-operation work instead of competition to achieve success. I have a perfect mind to accept the hard work of other achievers by team co-operation. So I recommend everyone to follow both ways to achieve something. Co-operation is the most powerfull weapon to achieve victory and it perfectly helps many people to achieve their team. And don't critisize others by the negative words and try to encourage them that will give extra energy to them to achieve more and more victories in thier lifetime. Why I say all these things is cooperation is much more significant way to achieve success.Don't see the ways of achieving something just see the results of their involement in thier work.
