There are many things in life that one must achieve. People are usually working towards some type of goal at any given moment in their life. Sometimes these goals can be achieved through competition and sometimes through cooperation. I think that cooperation can prove to be more useful and bring people more success. 

Through cooperating with others, we can achieve much more than we can with just competition. Competition can become nasty, toxic and cause conflict with others. With competition there can only be one winner realistically. With cooperation we learn much more about ourself and others, build relationships and everyone wins when you are working as a team. Some people may say that competition builds character or makes you stronger. While this can be true, cooperation can do the exact same things without the negative aspects that competition can bring about. You can also gain more life skills with cooperation than with competition. 

For example, say you have a competition where a group of people are building a house. If everyone was working individually to try and be the best, it would likely take much longer to complete the house. However, if people cooperated with each other, communicated and exchanged ideas, they would achieve success much quicker. They would also learn and build skills that they wouldn't gain working alone.

Competition and cooperation both have their place in society, but in the end, we can achieve much more working together than we can against each other. Competition can bring out the worst in people and cause strife, while cooperation can bring out the best in people and get even better results. Cooperation is overall the better choice.
