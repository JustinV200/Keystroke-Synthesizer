Introduction
I am an artist who follows minimalism. I teach people art therapy. There's a mystery behind minimalism, which is hard to figure out. An art made of simple forms and shapes & patterns simply helps one to aim at finding the meaning. Colours add value to life.

Concept of minimalism
A strong open mindedness is required to understand this artwork. Being less judgemental is another greatest task. From my personal point of view, there are only very few people  who succeed. Individuals who live in wealthy communities seem less happier than that of slightly moderate monied people. A Branded car makes him happy. But an updated version of the same car makes him less happier because he may not be afford to buy eveything that is available in the market. The main motive of minimalism is Use less- waste less. Recycle everything you use.

Understanding
When there are fewer materials around you, the mind becomes more calmer. Art therapy is one form of minimalistic approach where leads your mind into calmness and meditation. Meditate is not just sitting still at a corner and watching your breath. Meditation is anything and eveything where you're able to put your mind, heart and soul into that one particular action. It can be anything under the world. Creating your won garden is another purest forms of minimalism. The theory just tells us to listen to the nature and the inner calmness. This concept mainly helps in space saving buildings.
