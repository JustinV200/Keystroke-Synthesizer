Think of the first time you meet someone. You generally want to make a good first impression as this is often what people will remember about you moving forward. At times, you might present yourself as different than you really are in order to make a good first impression. The same can be said for product promotion. You are much more likely to remember a product that has a catchy song in the commercial or that has flashy packaging. It can be easy to assume that because the product is well promoted that it will be a "good" product, but this is not always the case. Products may have great packaging, but the product can miss the mark entirely.

Political campaigns are often developed to target a certain demographic and the same can be said for media campaigns for entertaininers or other public figures. In these cases, it is imperative that individuals do independent research to support their decision making. 

The emphasis placed on having a "good" image can be detrimental. It's concerning to think that others can be caught up enough in a brand that it causes them to be disingenious and to ignore their values for success.
