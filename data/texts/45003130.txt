Some say the cream rises to the top. I say the cream is simply a product of the rest of the ingredients working together to produce it. You cannot have cream without milk, and you cant have milk, without a cow.  You cant have a cow without first raising a calf, and it takes food to do that. Food that has been grown by others. 

Throughout my experiences. I have found that co-operation is the backbone of any operation. A person alone might be able to create an idea, but in order to materialize it, a team is necessary. There are many moving parts to any type of idea. More than one person can handle alone.  If a single person rises to the top it is only through the support they have been given by their support network. 

Of course there are those who will argue against this. Some will say it is competition that breeds excellence however, If you find yourself standing in the middle of an empty arena, then what did you actually win? Success relies on the recognition of others. Without it, there is nothing. Even when a person feels they have succeeded alone, they have not. This is why co-operation supercedes competition as the only way to achieve success. 

Every success is reliant on the discoveries and work of those who came before them. This is for sure. But an idea is only as strong as the people who are willing to put the pieces of it together. Our work today is made easier because of the people who worked together to create the infrastrcutures of today's society. That is yet another reason why co-operation will always be neccassry to achieve success.
