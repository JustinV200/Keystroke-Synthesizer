In today's world, you simply cannot escape advertising. In stores, watching videos online, using your phone, even in recreational activities such as playing a video game, you will encounter advertising of some kind. If we are constantly bombarded with advertising that attemps to sway us one way or the other, how can we know which thoughts are organically ours? I do believe images and impressions have far too much of an affect on people. In the following argument and reasoning I intend to make in this essay, I believe that I will clearly convince you (and possibly) others of this.

Lets look at a clear example of advertising influence: smart phones. People are led to believe that they must simply have the newest and latest phones, no matter what it costs. Even if the price is a yearly cost of 1,500 US dollars, people are willing (and excited) to pay this price. There could be minimal upgrades between the current version and the newest, but the pressure from advertising makes them feel they cannot live without it. Those that choose not to buy a yearly upgrade can sometimes be mocked by those that do choose to purchase a yearly upgrade.

While there are plenty of other examples that exist of advertising influence (and pressure), I believe this one argument is convincing on its own. The cost, the pressure, and the social view on this is enough by itself. People, in general, will complain about minimal costs to neccessary costs such as food. The increase of food will be nothing compared to the yearly cost of the latest, greatest phones but people will feel like they're getting ripped off nonetheless. I believe that if there wasn't as much advertising about having to have the newest phones, people would be less likely to feel like they absolutely have to have it.
