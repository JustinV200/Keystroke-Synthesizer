I believe that money doesn't buy happiness and that in todays society we are to materialistic and we should focus more on experiences than on material things in your life. my first reason for this is that at the end of the day your going to remeber your life experiences such as traveling more than the materialistic things you bought such as an expensive car or house you bought. I also feel like spending all your money on expensive things will get you no where at the end of the day.  People may argue that the material things make them happy and that they can't live without them especially they're phones or computers but that is affecting our social lives and can be blamed on being to materialistic in the times were living in. I feel its more important for us to spend time together without or material items as a distraction. In conclusion I believe that modern society should be criticized for being to materialistic because we all are to dependent on the material things in our lives and at the end of our lives were all going to be remembered for the things we did and how we made people feel. Not for the the material things we owned in our lives. My second reason why we should be blamed for being to materialistic is because we all have to many things that we want to buy but we don't actually need in our lives.  another important reason we can be seen as materialistic is because everyone wants the best of the best especially the newest iphone, computer, car etc. even though at the end of the day older versions are still just as good as the older ones. another reason we can be critizied for being to materialistic is because back in the old days even just 20 years ago we weren't as dependent on material things and kids actually went outside to play with their friends instead of playing on an Ipad or Iphone.
