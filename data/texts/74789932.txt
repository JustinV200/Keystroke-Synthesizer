We as a human race are becoming numb to reality. We're constantly bombarded on a daily basis with advertising that comes from every aspect of our lives from our phones to gas pumps.  Celebrity and polititians telling us what to believe in or what the truth is, to the point where we have no clue who to trust.  I believe that this is having a massive effect on us as a society concerning the way we look not just at others but at ourselves.

Our whole society spends the majority of time consuming social media which from my experience is a swamp of confusion and misinformation with a little bit of truth shoved in there.  I think it's especially hazardous for young kids.  Teenagers are growing up online with people telling them they have to look a certain way or fit into a certain image of what a perfect person is and that just does not exist.   The internet has exasberated this problem massively.  Yet some people believe the conviences we gain from so many ideas and choices, which I don't think it's a bad thing that we have access to all these diffrent images and impressions but it can be harmfull.

While we are in a way blessed to be able to share all of these things we need to also remember to look inside ourselves to try and find what we really believe instead of just following what another shows or tells us.  So all in all I do believe we are overly affected by all of these false impressions but I think we just need to open our eyes and make sure we  aren't being fooled by all the charades going on in the world.
