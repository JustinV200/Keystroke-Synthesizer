        Materialism has changed the world by focusing on uncessary valuables that don't benefit me. I spend time browsing and buying new products to let them collect dust on the shelves years later. I continue to ask myself why I should bother with a brand new product if I only open the box. It got to a point where I held on to trash as if the garbage was worth gold. This habit puzzeld me for years until I removed  this habit through the years. Holding on to products of any sort eventually damages us by clinging to animate objects resembling idols.
        Imagine worshipping your product like new a new tv or a new headset like your life depending on it. It's unhealthy, and I would become obsessed with cleaning and never letting anyone grab my product. This leads me to believe I still hang on to high school clothes and shoes. Once you begin to let go of this worldly life. I no longer feel the need to fill it with material that only hurts me. Choosing not to hold on to material brings more joy in my daily life. 
        Materialism can affect your life if you're not careful of things that make you whole. Spending hours on a smartphone or playing video games all day and night develops a necessity for these items. Once we break or lose these valuables, it rips a part of us out,  and then we buy another similar product next year. Instead of chasing materialist items, why not stop and rethink what's keeping you from being you and not making yourself become in debt.
