By the observation some of the people think that competition as th only way to achieve success but actually one who wants to succeed in the life they want to put more concentration on their  work ,they have to concentrate on both competion and cooperation.
Because if the people have idea about the concept of their work by conducting group discussion and know the facts about the process and hoe it can be works only by getting the information if they are coperated with the other members only.
But in the same way if he wants to succeed ,in todays world lot of competition is goin on between each and indivial persons.so one must to know more knowledge about their work and experience.If he puts work hard he can able to succeed in his life,like many successful people their is the hard life story is their ,so if anybody want to be success they have to competitive with the others.
By concluding,both cooperation and competition is much more needed for his life to became a successful part.no one can get their success easily without putting any effort on their work. concentrate and hard work can make the person to get success when they are in the competitive world.
