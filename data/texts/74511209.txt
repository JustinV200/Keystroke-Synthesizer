       I think cooperation is must for success but competition is very important to prove one self to every one in his or her particular field. Lot of people are very talented in this fast world and they have lot of resources to learn or get trained in a lot of ways but competitions is the only way to overcome the barriers in his or her aims. every one have a unique aims or achievements in their life.
        Achievement through competition is more valiable than cooperations. we have lot of problems in achieveing our goals. we must cooperate with our team members are others to achieve a goal but it is helpful for group success or a team success only. If we want to achieve by our self competition is very important.
        I have one best friend he is very talented and he is a very skilled person in a particular field. He practises hardly to stay in a particular field. He always cooperate with his team members or coordinators but he still wait for the competition to achieve or succeed in his particular field. I think success through competitions are more valuable than coopertion because success through cooperation is shortterm success. competitions is a long term success.
