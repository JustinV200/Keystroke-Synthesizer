I think its a complicated  question. It all depends on what is happening mentally with a person. I think for the most part if starts with the happiness of that person and then it goes to others.  IT is hard to happy others be happpy when you are not happy yourself. You have to have that inside and it has to be true to you, not fake. Fake happiness does more harm then good. 
When a person can work on themselves and is trully happy, that is when things change. That happiness starts to grow so large that you dont want to do anything but give it to others. Its like your mind and heart is overloaded with joy and love. So much so that you want to sprend it to others and help with the heaing process. 
They happiness is what will you give to othes. It will be the charging force that is the spear head at the healing of unhanity.  They is what is needed for eveyrone to start the process of trying to be happy. It is what will give the world  better change at survul in. work that can be so cruiel. We all will have our time to be happy and truth together.
