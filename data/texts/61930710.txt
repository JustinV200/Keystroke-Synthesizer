Does it matter?
Modern life is certainly too focused on materialism.  As Yoko Ono is said to have said, "when you're dead, you don't take nothing with you but your soul."  It's certainly something to think about. 
On the other hand, I suppose, if you don't believe in an afterlife, maybe the accumulation of material things and being a good participant in "consumer culture" is a valid path.
I'm afraid it isn't for me.
Maybe the definition of materialism is part of the problem for me.  Maybe it has to do with "attachment". Seeing the world as a collection of "things" can get in the way of experiencing life as it naturally is.  Nature is God's nature, in my opinion, and God has no need of acquiring stuff.  Sure, as human beings, we need to "handle" things; but I think we need to handle them gently, carefully, loosely, and wisely as good stewards of God's creation.
But, once again, I'm speaking from a position of faith.  If you don't believe as I do, I still might ask you to consider the consequences for future generations of an attitude of excess, which leads to more landfills, garbage-filled oceans, and generally just a fouling of our own nest.
Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?  I don't care; I'm going to criticize it anyway!
Mankind can and should learn to cooperate with nature; embrace the patterns of life, and not get caught up in a pattern
