     People are more likely to be happy when they are focusing on their own dreams and personal goals rather than focusing on the happiness of others. When we focus on our own dreams and goals we are able to attain a good number sucesses, like graduating high school or buying a house. There are set number of things that need to be done or steps to take and with a bit of discipline can usually be obtained. When goals are obtainable we are able practice, learn and gain sucess which gives us confidence that is needed to move on to other goals and sucesses. This creates a rewarding life experience even when we don't always suceed because we have little wins along the way we learn that wins are possible. 
     When it comes to focusing on the happiness of others rather than ourselves things get a bit foggy. The goal usually isn't clear because we have no idea what others truly want or need to help them be happy. The cycle of poverty is a good example of this. There have been many homeless people given homes and resources that get them out of the streets and into more stable living and working conditions, yet nearly all return to homelessness. The same is for career criminals, they cycle in and out of prisons even with counceling, work oportunities and transitional housing. This is because we don't have enough understand of human drivers and why we make many of the choices we do. So, when helping others it is unlikely that you would know how to help or what kind of help is needed. Leaving most efforts unfruitful, which leads to disapointment and feelings of frustration rather than happiness. 
     The feelings of success that comes with reaching small goals makes one more likely to reach for and attain more goals this is why one should focus on personal goals and dreams. Which results in a happier life.
