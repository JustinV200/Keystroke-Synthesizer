We tend to happy in our own specific tastes. Our own persona has a way of determining our happiness. People arew fundamentally different from one another. So the way they think are also different. This difference in thought processing makes us different, unique. One person can be happy with doing a certain thing while the other can be happy doing something else entirely.

As we like to think differently, our "choice" of being happy at certain things also changed. While one may love tending to their garden, reading books etc, these are specified as hobbies, and for this particular topic we are not going to take hobbies into consideration. So one can also be happy by pursuing what they want in life or helping others in pursuing their goals. It's the journey towards the goal that makes one happy rather than the goal itself. Now  saying which is more likely to make people happy is like saying which hobby is the best hobby. The answer will differ person to person. It comes down to personal tastes and characteristics that define what makes one truely happy. People are more likely to be happy if they do what they want to do, if they follow their heart they are bound to find happiness. Just as you can't force a 2nd grader to love geometry and calculus, it is a process of finding what makes you truely enjoy what you are doing.

In conclusion, people can find happiness by enjoying what they do, by doing what they enjoy.
