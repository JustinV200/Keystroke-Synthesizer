Introduction:
                 Everyone in the world seems materialised now. This is really horrible. This makes one hates others. Everyone gives compliments to others for their jobs. I am not talking about the positive comments. Negative comments discouraging persons to try new things. 

Causes: 
                 People should be kind to others. People should encourage others for getting out their talents. Hating others will keep them alone. It will create a society in which people don't speak with others. I think the main reason for critisizing others is inferiority complex. People compare themselves with others always. Because of that people started to critisizing others for their small mistakes too.

Effect:
         Effects of materialism is severe than we were thinking. We can't support materialism in any manners. People will be get away from others. This will affects new inventions. It will mentally affect others. Materialism will affect the people in mind wise and people can't do anything new.

Conclusion:
        Like others I also think people should be away from the materialism. People shouldn't criticize others for their mistakes. People should be kind to others. People should appreciate others for their achievement. People should love others as they love themselves. I think this will make our world happy somuch.
