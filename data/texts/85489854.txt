The images and impressions has effect in reality. Yes, most of the time it does, but sometimes it gives the described value as same as images and impressions of it. Some even gives more value greater than it's images and impressions.

First, people's are judged by their looks and discipline. When meeting a person for the first time or attending a interview the first thing they see is how we dressed properly and second the taking. It both gives the best image and impression of us. Like this everything has it's image and impression. We are updating and experiencing us and all the things around us. we know some basic things. Images and impressions like when meeting a new person we don't know about them. What if he or she is a bad person. If he or she is bad person the proper dressing and good talks makes good image and impression of their look but their inner content is bad. Because their character is bad.

Most of the people choose the high brand because its attractive it's image and impression is good.
