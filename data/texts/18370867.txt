     How do I get happy?  Bottle it up, then let the secret sauce out whenever I am feeling down.  The key may just be your personal being and the things that make you happy.  Sure it feels good and gives you that tingly feeling all over to help someone else be happy, but at the end of the day you are always left with your feelings.
     If you can't make yourself feel happy than you can't be in touch enough with others to help them feel happy.  When you feel happy in what you are doing or how you are helping someone that is part of your personal goal.  Live life be happy others will feed off your happiness, like a magnet.  Yes it is somewhat true that helping someone else reach their happiness makes you feel happy.  Is that not part of you and your goals though.  If bringing your happiness and sharing it with others is your persona, and your aura that is great.  This I argue is your personal goal of just being happy with the best you.
     So in conclusion what I am saying is don't be confused that helping someone else be happy isn't part of your own personal goal.  You being happy who you are just be you and happy.
