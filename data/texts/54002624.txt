     In todays society everyone values the things that they have. The more money we make the more things we get, the fancier things we can get, or we can keep up with the Joneses. Is a problem that we continue to collect things? Is it a problem that we buy things we dont need or use? More importantly, Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?

     I don't belive so. I think as time goes on we will continue to make higher wages and buy more things. At this point in our society its just a part of life and has built itself into our economy. There is no reason to judge anyone for what they have or dont have. 

     As I stated, materialism has built itself into our economy. If it wasent there wouldnt be so many new cars and trucks being built every year; we are almost pushed to feel like we have to have that new F150. Ease of shopping online and the algorithm to help us find the things we didn't know we wanted. All that money spent creates jobs and pays taxes.

      Minimalist may say being materialistic is toxic or pointless; But  being materialistic only can be toxic or hurt others when other are envious. If you worried about what others have, you will never be happy with yourself. If it makes someone happy to buy new shoes or have the latest phone, let them be happy. If it bothers you what others do, then find something that makes you happy and forget about them.

     I think it's fine to be materialistic, if it makes you feel good do it. As long as no one is getting hurt then everything is fine. There are more things to worry about in this world than to criticize someone for loving the things they have.
