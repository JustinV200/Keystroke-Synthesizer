  People are lost in non reality. We see too much that isn't real but we are starting to believe it is real and our expectations are becoming too high. Everyone wants everything but they are not happy when they get it. They just want more and more because it's not satisfying. The world has become a very materialistic place where self interest is more important than pride and happiness.
  I believe our minds are overstimulated with everything we see online and everything that can be bought online and in stores. I personally see many people that will waste money that they really don't have to buy something that they don't need to try to make themselves happy. Of course it doesn't work so they just keep doing it anyway over and over until they have a houseful of useless stuff that they don't know what to do with and they are still unhappy.
  I believe people are looking for happiness but they have forgotten how to achieve that. The world has become a very lazy place so people think it's easier to buy something they want instead of getting out of the house and being adventurous and actually enjoying life. You can buy products all day long but the reward is not long lasting. Memories of things that we do are what matters and creates happiness. Time spent with others creates happiness. We all really need to take a step back and rethink what we actually want and enjoy in life.
