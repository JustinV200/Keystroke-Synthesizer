In today's day and age, we seem to be bombarded by beauty standards. We are made to feel that these standards are achevieable, but we are being presented with a false reality. What we are really being shown is unattainable beauty standards.

It has become difficult to escape these images and advertisements. It is on TV, it is shown in movies and magazines. And as technology advances, the biggest culprit is social media. Photos, and even videos now, can be maniuplated to acehive any look. Often times what you see is a maniuplated jawline, a whitened smile, lightened skin. 

These imagines can often make individuals feel inferior, as they don't have these false attributes. They don't realize they are in envy of something fake and computer generated. We are constantly presented with the idea of beauty, happiness, and success being going hand in hand, that it can be hard to focus on anything else. I think the popularity of reality television has also contributed to this. We think we're seeing people "who are just like us" or "everyday folks". We see theese people with those unattainble beauty standards living happy and successful lives. It makes us believe that they key to happiness is looking a certain way. When in reality, most of these people have had significant advantages in their lives, not to mention countless surgerys and enhancements. Therefore, they only represent a small fraction of the population.

I believe that public figures and advetisers vow to take a more realistic approach to the images they put out there. There is a certainly responsibility that I think one takes on when they become a public figure. I think once the advertising and entertainment industry work on being more inclusive and finding beauty in everyone, we can influence coming generations to be more confident.
