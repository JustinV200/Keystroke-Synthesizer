although it is understandible to believe that competition is more likely to cause better results, due to the want to do better then others causing most people to work harder then they would have otherwise, cooperation is even more like to cause better results, due to the want to impress and the desire to not be useless in a team. however, with some people, working together can cause worse results than either cooperation and competition, this is because some people would feel the need to stall or destroy anothers progress, this is partly in thanks to modern schooling, due to the fact that to do well in school, you usually have to do better then others and the fact that cooperation in school is usually not rewarded.

however that isnt the only reason for competition in life being common, it is also due to things like promontions in the workplace, mostly thanks to the fact that being granted promotions usually means you have to do better then somebody else, for if you work together, only one of you will get a promontion not both. however the problem with this fact is, that most promontions in the workplace are granted thanks to the need for another manager or another similar role, but most of the time when a new manager is needed, only one is needed, therefore it is nearly impossible to promote cooperation in the workplace without having to make promotions signifigantly less common.

but even still, with all that information laid out, there is yet another reason for competition to be so common. it is simply the human need to do better then others, although it is possible, to remove this need would be extremly difficult, this is mostly in thanks to the fact that in nature, man would have to show his feats and accomplishments to become the "alpha" or leader of a group, however, this trait isnt a feature of everybody, in the modern world more and more people are realising that to truly achive great things, we have to work together.

hope isnt lost yet, as the world keeps changing and evolving, so do the people that live in it, more and more people are working together and trying to help eachother, that is partly due to the hard place the world is in, thanks to COVID-19 and other world events like the russian invasion of ukrain. as these hard events keep happening, more people are realising that war and competition is not the way, everyday more people realise that we have to cooperate if we want to make it as a species,

in closing, all we can do is hope and work together.
