This is my opinion about being materialistic in modern society, I don't think it is good to be materialistic, but we are raised to covet material things, we are given gifts for birthdays and Christmas at an early age, children are led to beleive that gifts are a part of these celebrations.  I wish we could focus more on celebrating the holiday or the birthday than the gifts.  Society judges people on the amount of money they make, what kind of house the live in, what kind of car they drive, and the quality and quantity of their posessions, when they should be judged as a person and there willingness to help other people.  U would love to see things progree to a point that more people were good and helpful to other people out of the goodness of their heart and not always for monetary gain.  I think society would be better if we helped one another and accpted help from others.  Every person has a skill or ability that they are good at, if we put thse skills together we could acheive a much higher goal.  In conclusion, I am happy with society in general, but it would be a much better place if we all worked together.
