How do we achive more success? Some people say competition, others say cooperation. 

In my personal work life, I say cooperation, has been the best way to achive more success. With that being said, I have been in competitions where I did achive more success, where I did win the prize. It was friendly and no one had any hard feeling at the end of the competition. 

I have seen competitions that turned into fights and backstabbing because the people where so competitive that they forgot that this was suppose to be a morale and team building exercise. I have seen other competitions where everyone did work together that was on the team and they did win. 

I have had the pleasure to be on teams or by myself where cooperation and input from all worked better. With that being said, I have seen where cooperation did leave out people and their ideas. ( Which happen to be really good ones.) Even though there was to cooperation, there are times that one or two people seem to take over and that is where it could turn into a competition instead of cooperation. 

When you have managers, team leaders, and supervisers that is willing to listen to the people that is under them, cooperation or competition can achive success. I think it depends on the type of job, sport, etc. which one would be more successful.
