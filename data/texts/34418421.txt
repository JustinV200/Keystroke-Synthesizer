     I propose in this essay that people are only happy when they achieve their goals. Every people has a lot of personal. We should never compare our selves to others and be very happy with what we have. Don't  always compare yourself to the more rich people. We should think that we are happy when we see people in poverty. 

     We should live with a goal if everyone should be comfortable. Don't be jealous of others. My father was very difficult situation when I was growing up. They never gave up and he had the goal that we should definitely move forward in life. Working as a normal laborer in a company, they appreciated his honestly and gave him a higher position, now he is working as a manager. He achieved his goal and fulfilled our needs and we are very happy now.

     Some people get discouraged because they are not able to achieve their goals. It is true for everyone that perceverance leads to success. Everyone will treat us very low when we are suffering. If we set a goal in life and follow what we have to do very carefully in the same way we can achieve our goal. Only then can we be happy.
