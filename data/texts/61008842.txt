Success can be defined a couple of ways, in parallel - it can also be obtained different ways as well. It's thought that competition is the way success can be acheived, however, others believe that the power of cooperation is more effective and has significant lasting effects.

"In a complex world, cooperation is much more likely to produce significant, lasting accomplishments." 

I agree with the statement because, with cooperation, there is a common end-goal that motivates everyone to work with and for the same said outcome. I believe it also provides a positive social dynamic with people working together towards the same common goal. Even though people may have different thoughts as to how the goal should be acheived, this can be worked through with negotiation and compromise. 

As a team, it's natutal to cooperate with each other. Trying to see eye-to-eye and perceive the desired outcome already acheived. More success is gained by working together.

I can see how competition can be started - even with a common end-goal in place. Whether it be to see who can obtain it the fastest, or in the smartest fashion, or the most efficient. There will always be competition in a cooperating environment. But it's not the best way to acheive success.

In conclusion, these differences could be set aside and the whole picture should be looked at; making an agreement to work in unison for the common ground. Success is for all, not just for one. If we all worked together as a team, we could obtain success quicker, more efficient, and in the smartest ways possible.
