Do you remember how happy you were the first time you made a basket? Or landed your first job? How happy are you when you see a friend, loved one, or even a perfect stranger, succeed in something? Or be kind for no apparent reason? Happieness can come in all ways, shape and form but, what do you think makes us the happiest? Achieving personal goals or does our happiness rely on others?

Personal goals are important to us no matter how big or small. From a very young age we recieve gratification from achieving these goals. With each goal achieved we become more satisfied with our life, which in turn brings us happiness. It is insilled into us that we will only be happy if we work hard and check each item off of our to do list, acquire all the materialistic things we can and have a roof over our head and food in our bellies. 

Some may argue that happiness doesn't come from our focusing on our own personal goals and it actually comes from outside sources. Seeing humanity and the world as a whole being and doing better is the ultimate happiness. And, I agree. 

If we focus solely on our own wellbeing, goals and happiness the world will only become a darker place. We need to stop being so self centered and selfish, worrying about ourselves, and start worrying about our neighbors and the world as a whole. I can't find true happiness if everyone and everything around me is not thriving and doing well. 

All in all, whether happiness comes from focusing solely on ourselves or the happiness of others, we will always strive to find the next best thing that will spark some sort of joy. Will it be my own personal successes or will it be the kindness of a stranger?
