Is the competition killing you? We think this could be true!

Studies have shown that an environment of constant competition in work or play can raise blood pressure and make you sick. 

It is true that being competitive is the way to get ahead. You can make more money at work by getting a raise from the boss. You can sell more product by having competitive pricing. And your peers will show respect and awe. 
 
And you could drive that shiny new Tesla....to your grave! 

How would you feel about an alternative to all this  pressure? What if everyone enjoyed success by cooperation? 

Cooperation with your co-workers and friends could lighten your load. Shared responsibility for the best outcome in your industry. If everyone worked equally we could share in the success long-term. Each person would be given a place that can highlight their strengths. 
Cooperation has been shown to get equal results and bring more stability and ease to  your life. All the benefits, including the Tesla without all the pressure. 
Little to no stress can lower your blood pressure. When you're happy the family and friends are happy. And you are well enough to enjoy all that life can offer.
