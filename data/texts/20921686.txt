           On my own opinion both are mixed. Achieving  personal goal gives more happiness it takes lot of strength , time , hardwork and patience Apart from that pursuing our own happiness is a good thing .Because if we are not ready to pursue our own happiness how we make others happy.Firstly and more importantly we need to achieve our own goal with effort that makes our life more ease and pleasent.
Now we ready to smile with others happiness because humanity shows here.
          Here it is i have two friends my friend A soley thinks that achieving his personal goal is more important and my friend B thinks that happiness of others compare to both seems like my friend B helps more childrens with food and education he says, that gives him happiness he finds happiness in childrens face.
           After hearing him i think my friend B seems more happy beacuse not on a personal gain he thinks helping the people in needs brings more happy this brings a humanism is amore happiness than a personal gain.We all think how we find happiness on others but that is the blind truth we happy and my friend very happy we are happy. Happiness is based on how we see and feel.....
