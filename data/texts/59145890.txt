Happiness is the main concept people run behind. Each and everyone have their own defintion of happiness. So we cannot say there is only one way to be happy. Some people get happiness from serving others and others by having a good life for themselves. In both case one can't be juged for their action.

People who pick to their goals achivement is the way to happiness are more likly to be realistes and private person. From a young age they may have be thought to be the best version of themselves to succed in life. These people can be really compatative and ambiton oriented.

People who pick serving others is the way to achive happiness is more likely to look like a good person but they are doing the service for their own gain not by the goodness of their heart there is  a big difference between people who does thing out of goodness and for their personal satisfaction the people who seek happiness throug servicing other may lose their happiness from the moment they know they can't serve others which can be mentally demanding and make them have a very unsatisfied life.

Overall everyone is running towards the concept of happiness but the truth is a person only can lead a happy life when he leaves expectation behind so both ways above isn't the way for happiness.
