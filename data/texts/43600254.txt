In these days people are very active in lots of field area and they want to be always winner in their filed. and for be the winner in every field should have focuse and concentrate.
Some people really likes doing their works and task in a group but some people just doinf their task independtly. I think if a person want to be sucsesfull in evey field area should always remmber what is this area need colabrate or not. If that works need team work so it is very important to be succsefull and winer do their best in team work beside that try to do more from other group members and try to be leader in that team. 
If a manager feels that you are very good at team work and also you are very better and efective than the others for progress of that tasks and assignements, it would be give the sence to managers that you are the best. 
In my opinoin for being succseful person, you should be active in cooperation and competiton both succsefull in that momemnt you can say that you are a susccfeull person. If a person be in competiton always after while he/she would be tired or be just in gruop work after while sence that did not recive any bonuse so, they would be tired. For this reason persons should always be coopertaions and competitve. The main goal is be best so shuld working hard in to area and try to convince people that not only you are a compettive person but also you can work as a member of team and have abilty of team work.
