In my opinion, most of the people are likely to be happy only when they are focused on their own goals. If they achieve on thier own goals, It gives immense pleasure and gives more confident which makes them to achieve more and more. Ultimately people began to shine in their field of interest. Persuing self goal is very important in everyone's life. Working on smller goals helps to gain confidence in order to achieve larger goals.

One may find happiness in making the people around them happier, but it lasts for only small amount of time. If you need an happier life, you should concentrate on your own goals, which gives satisfication. Also, I agree that one cannot be happy, if the people around is not well. But it is impossible for a single person to make everyone happier around. So it is better to concentrate on their own goals that concentrating the surroundings, automatically the people around will benefit.

Overall, one can be satisfied and happy only when they persue their own goals.One can be satisfied if they make the people aroound them happy, it wont give ultimate happiness. Achieving goals earns you prestiege, honor and will increse your status in the world.
