     Well neither. The question is if people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal growh or on the happiness of others. In order to maximize happiness, you would focus on happiness. The same thing is true for the others. If you want to benefit humanity, focus on benefitting humanity. 
     A lot of thought has gone into how to become rich. It has been said that in order to become rich, you have to not be focused on the money. And I guess that's true if you don't realize that you need a product or a service. 
     I don't think the personal development thing makes any sense. Just a focus on making products or services better. Then you are thinking about your customer constantly. And you'll automatically do whatever it takes to satisfy them. You need to be basically proficient like in the English language. And you need to have basic social skills though.
     A lot of problems are not worth solving because there is too much of a low demand for them. It would be a mistake to try and perfect a product without ever bringing it to market. It's kind of like waiting until you are a millionare before going on a first date. So neither, but happiness of others is more on the right track.
