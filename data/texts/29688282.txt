I feel people are most happy when their focusing on other people goal's instead of their own.
Why? I've done research on how this world operates and nowadays, people are caught up on other people's dreams instead of their own. 

If, someone can put energy into what other's are accomplishing, then I feel they can put that same energy into doing whatever it is they have planned, instead of day dreaming and being unhappy because others are out here making it happen for themselves. 
It doesn't take much to become happy and set your own goals.

I think at an early age most of us have goals we set into play but some take a different route while others stay on track and execute what we've planned to do our whole life and this is why those who take the wrong way of life just end up unhappy and become jealous of what others accomplish. If I can be happy for others who set out goals and make it in life, then I can be happy for myself. Self motivation is all it takes plus the people whose routing for us is also the key to happines and setting our goals so we could be truly happy.

 I'm hoping someone out here takes this serious and once you set your goals, go with your move. Remember everyone's path to happiness is different.
