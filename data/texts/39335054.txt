     Happiness is most likely when the happiness of others is our personal goal. Doing only for ourselves and not others may bring some gratification but true happiness comes form desiring that gratification for others. We smile when they are immediately happy and smile again as we think of their continued happiness and what that happiness itself will bring to others.

      There are many examples to be found in American society of people who find happiness in this way, often very successful, wealthy people who choose to help others becausse that fulfills them. There are countless celebrities, rich and famous, often themselves catered to who aren't truly happy until they start helping at a soup kitchen and find happiness in serving others. The very rich are often philanthropist for this reason, all their wealth and power is not enough to provide deep down happiness that can be carried daily in one's heart. They find that building hospitals, funding scholarships and sponsoring healthy youth activites provide them with the lasting satisfaction no amount of money could provide alone.

     It could be argued that money is what allows them to give as they do and so it is the money that brings them happiness. There are many volunteers who are not much better off than the people they help who get just as much happiness from helping  in a soup kirchen, perhaps they are even happier being close to the same situation and truly understanding what a kind word and smile can do for someone. When we give of ourselves we receive from others things unseen but often forever felt.

     True happiness is most likely to come from desiring to help others, it fulfills us emotionally and spiritually.
