     In today's world more than ever before, we should not forget about the saying "Don't judge a book by it's cover". With the widespread use of smart phones, tablets and laptops, online advertising is  effecting people twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. Zombies are being created.

       Social media is debilitating one's ability to think for oneself. The herd mentality is a contagion that needs to be stopped.  It is too easy today for people to latch on to an existing opinion. It is important for people to separate, learn on their own, come to their own beliefs with their own minds by making judgements from acquiring knowledge. 

     This is not happening anymore. Probably because it takes time and effort to acquire knowledge. Things go viral. There is no depth. Judgements are made without reason. Going along with the crowd is not a good reason. There needs to be facts, figures, statistics, research backing up studies that people can rely on to make their opinions, but lately it has become impossible to have access to this.  

     It is truly a sad state of affairs. There can be no hope for the future without a vast change in how people perceive things and really care about whether or not they are true. Reality is important!
