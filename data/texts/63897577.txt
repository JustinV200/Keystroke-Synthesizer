How our minds interpet information that is absorbed every second of every day is
a remarkable thing. No two people react to information in a same way, and that's what makes each of us individuals.

Manufactures have homed in on this aspect of us for what seems like forever, by manipulating us through our senses, primarily seeing and hearing. This is also a trick used by politicians, who show you what you want to see and not allowing you to see what something actually is.

Once they show you something that they want for you to see, your brain begins processing that information which then leads to an overall interpretation of what you have seen. If it's believable enough, it becomes very difficult for a person to see it in any other way than it was interpreted my their brain. 

Advertisers use this very successfully when showing a manufactures products in a TV or print ad. They use colorful cartoon characters, precisely placed and perfect appearing food, the worst photos possible of an opposing political candidate, the most tearjerking photos possible of children in need, ECT...

Political committees use advertising that make fairly insignificant successes by their candidate look like they saved the world from an apocalypse. This is why some very promising candidates lose races to a less qualified candidate, who has substantial funding for their campaign. The old saying applies, "Money Talks and BS Walks".

In the end, it all comes down to how each of our brains interpret what we see and hear. It's not that all of us are weakminded and unable to make our own good decisions, it's how information is presented to us which highly influences our day to day decisions and views of everything in our world. It would be a very uninteresting planet if we all saw the world in the same way. Don't you agree? Don't worry, it's okay if you don't.
