Happiness is something that every individual strives for in their lifetime. There is controversy on how one finds happiness but there is one constant for finding happiness, and that is that it is different for everyone. Throughout this essay I will focus on how finding happiness is a matter of focusing on one's personal goals and not on the happiness of others. 

The reason I believe that happiness is found by focusing on one's personal goals is because that is something that you can control. Every human loves to be in control and they do not want to feel like their life is out of their hands. We all like to make our own decisions and that is part of what makes someone happy. Also, someone's personal goals may include making others happy so this is why people should focus on their own goals. This is the main reason why you should focus on your own goals because those may also make other people happy. For example, focusing on your own goals to grow up and be the first family member to finish college could make the rest of your family happy. This is an example of you focusing on your own goals and this creates happiness for other people. 

However, there is the argument of finding happiness when you focus on the happiness of others. This is true but there are people out there who do not want to help others and that is the sad truth of society. I feel like most people do find happiness in helping others but not everyone does. So, if everyone focuses on their own personal goals, there will be more happiness in society which in turn can make society better all around. In conclusion, you should always focus on your own personal goals to pursue happiness.
