The constitution of the United States of America allows it's residents the pursuit of happiness. But how does one find happiness? I believe that happiness is found when they focus on helping others. A person may pursue to their dreams and personal goals, but that alone will not bring them happiness. 
When a person compares their life to someone else's, jealousy and envy will most likely set in. That person will no longer be happy with their life and what they have. They will have the mind set of "Once I have what they have, I will be happy." Comparision is the theif of happiness. A person may acknowledge other's goals and achievements, but they cannot allow that to steal their own happiness. 
If a person focuses on their own goals, the only person they can compare themself with is them. They have to come up with their own dreams and goals then they need to work and challenge themself to pursue those dreams and goals. I do believe that along the way of pursuing your own goals, you should also focus on helping others. Being selfless and helping others can bring a person more happiness than they could imagine. 
It is important that a person works on themself and chases after their goals but one should also pursue the assistance of others. I believe that happiness is found in helping others.
