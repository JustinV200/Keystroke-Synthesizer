Happiness is inside of each human being. We do have to follow our instincts to find it.
Im happier when I do things that will bring a smile to others.
the simple things in life, even those that I do for others, even giving a gift to someone bring so much joy and happiness to my life.
I find happiness every single day, from above, from my angel in heaven, who is my Dad.

You dont need luxuries, to get to be full happy. You see, most of the time, those who dont have enough in life, are the ones who know how to live fully happy, they are the ones who show us the simple things in life to be happy.

Pray is a big plus when you really want to enjoy a moment, and look around when things go wrong.
Every single person should do good to others to bring happinness around. 
I have my moments when it seems that I cant be able to find my path to enjoy life and bring happiness to myself.

My dad taught me, that, happiness is like when you find your goal in life, happiness brings health benefits to your life.
We need to reach that goal in life, to enjoy each second of our lives.
The way the world is going around now, the war between countries, that is a reason to continue fight so the world is a better, and happier place to live.

Give it a try, being happy, enjoying the simple things in life, bring a smile to the world, is the way to conquer 
what we need in order to live in peace.
 

Life is fully developed to enjoy it, by being happy.
