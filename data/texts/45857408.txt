                       The answer for the question images and impressions have too much of an effect on people is true in my point of view because today everyone are living with advertisement , colors , stores and some colorful packages in our daily life. Advertisements and some others are filled with images and impressions so it really had an effect on today's people. today's people had more effect and interest on social medias and certain entertainments. in that entertainers and social media person gives more images what is the real world is so that really makes an effect on the peoples.
                            yes I think it is true that what we think becomes far more important than what really is.these images and impressions that was projected in medias and others are making us to think what is the real and what is not real. these advertisements and some other media stuffs are living with us each and every person daily. so that makes definitely an effect on people.
                              clever advertisements will definitely create favorable impressions because they depict clear picture of what is what in their advertisements. But sometimes that make them loss because they say very little about their product and their promotion is very less.So this is my point of view.
