One of my favorite teachers once said "Life isn't happy, its a string of happy moments." Sure it wasn't his quote but when he said it, it made sense. While the happiness of others is definitely important, it's also not something that the average person is going to have control over. Focusing on ones personal goals instead of the happiness of others will definitely lead to the strongest string. You only truly have the ability to judge your own happiness AND overall reaching your personal goals will be more fufilling.

"If they wanted to, they would." It's a phrase that has become so fluent in the newer generations. There has become a sudden realization that you can only be responsible for another person and their actions, and most importantly their feelings, up to a certain point until it no longer has anything to do with you. Yes, being around others that are happy will overall make you happy but allowing their happiness to depend on you overtime will exhaust even the strongest person. Happiness is too fluent of a emotion to be able to really understand anyones but your own, happy to me may not be the same as someone else and while that's ok, thats also why its important for everyone to be responsible for themselves. 

Most importantly, reaching your personal goals, no matter how big or how small, will always give you a level of happiness that no one else can take away from you. If I spend a week saving a $100, no one can take that away from me. I can also spend a week cheering up my best friend just for her ex-boyfriend to call and ruin it all in 30 seconds. 

Yes, you will be more happy if others around you are happy but happiness comes from within and its time for people to admit that.
