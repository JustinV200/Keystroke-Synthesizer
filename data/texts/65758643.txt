Success is something which everyone loves to taste. Whaterever the way is, the ultimate goal is to attain the success. Lets have a clear vision about the words "success", "competition" and "cooperation". Success is the ultimate victory of the given target. Competition holds the rules and also the target of the play. Coperation is something which the players should have in order to win the trophy (success) of the competition. 
Also, there is something which we all should agree that "this is the competitive world". Everyone is running for the success in which one should help the other in order to make the path easier to reach success easily. May be cooperation must be there among people to accomplish their game easily. It may be either in a game, life or in work place.
We can see it from the other side that some people are strong only when they work alone. Also, we should agree that people can achieve success without any help from others but without competition there won't be any target so there will be no no success. Only the competition will drive people towards the success. Cooperation between competitors might make the path easier but the driving force is only the competition. So my final stand point is that only competitive nature will drive the people internally towards the success.
