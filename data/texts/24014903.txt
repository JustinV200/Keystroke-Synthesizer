It is within human nature to be competitive with others, whether it be in sports, work, or a fun game with friends. In these same settings, people may also need to cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal. This presents the question of whether competition is more likely to achieve success rather than cooperation. In this essay I will explain why cooperation achieves a higher rate of success than competition. 

When achieving a goal, cooperation among team members is key. Each member of the group is responsible for contributing their diverse skillset and input in order to reach a common goal. When the success of a project lies in the hands of a group, each member will make certain to work with others to accomplish it. 

On the other hand, if there competition were a means to achieve success I don't believe that success would be lasting. While competition can be very motivating, it can also be short sighted and selfish. For example, someone may make a quick judgement that is not thoroughly vetted in order to compete and "win". This type of decision making does not make for lasting success as it most likely does not take others interests into account. 

In our world today, those who cooperate rather than compete with others will have long lasting success as they are not only thinking about their personal success, but rather the success of a group. Cooperation leads to more informed decisions and a higher rate of achievement.
