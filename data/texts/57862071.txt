I am working at one office. i am managing 10 members in my team. my team was very innovative and efficiency. our team work will be success in our team cooperation. team co-operation is the main successful lead. every project work we are totally give full effective and energetic. i am very happy to see my team members. our cooperation is only the main successful reason. 
we are acheive this goal only the reason for co operation. but solo participants are not effective work in this field. i think my succeed reason are co-operation by my team members. but my oppsite person to give the full effort in one solo person. she is only the work in the team. but suddenly her work was stubborn to her. she is very affect our project.
every project will be participate in one single solo person. but some projects only the succeed. becuase team cooperation is learn all new things. give new some innovative things. but solo person is just one brain work so does not full effort in the project work. she cannot learn new things and new innovative ideas. solo not used in the project work. every person will give new things and new ideas. 
so every project will success in the team co-operation. i love team cooperation. solo performance is not effective.
