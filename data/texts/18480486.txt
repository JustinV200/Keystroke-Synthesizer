Let us discuss the argument concerning competition vs. cooperation. Which one of these will produce more significant and original new ideas. For the sake of argument, I will take the side of competition. Competition creates an opportunity and drive for persons trying to accomplish a specific task. My reasoning behind this argument is the strongest element between the two sides. Human emotion.

Human emotion in the form of competing with others will push a person to think harder, contribute more, and  work harder. People compete naturally in an effort to show off, attract mates or even to attempt to be the lead in the same group that inspired the competition. These natural actions and emotions give persons a REASON to come up with a good solution.

Cooperation on the other hand, will often find a group of people holding back what they really think and feel in an effort not to upset the others in a group. This alone is enough to stifle progress.  While cooperation certainly has it's benefits, I do not believe that the same types of solutions will be arrived at in the same situation.

Competitions are healthy ways to have those who can think quick on their feet or possible have a natural ability to lead rise to the top of the group. Without competition, where is the necessity to be creative, different, BETTER? WHile it may bring out some of the worst in certain characters, there is little doubt that healthy competition will also bring the best out of people, as well. Cooperation comes into the picture once the competition has been done. Cooperation puts the ideas into action. Competition thinks of them.

Cooperation or competitioin will always depend on the type of people involved. However, I believe that competition will almost always yield the most creative and innovative ideas due to our innate human need to compete with one another.
