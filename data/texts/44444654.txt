Do images and impressions have too much an effect on people? It depends on each person individually. For some it may have too much of an effect. For others it may have the opposite effect. It also depends what the images are for or where they are being uploaded to. For instance, someone getting their image published in a magazine, could have a positive effect. Someone getting their image published on the jail website, could have a negative impact. Someones image who gets uploaded to a social media app. Depending on the comments from the others could have both a positive and negative effect on people.
For me, my images give me both a positive and negative effect. Depending on the day. When i upload my images online. Sometimes i get positive feedback and sometimes its negative. I try not to allow what others say about me or to me make me feel down on myself. At times you just cant help it. That's also why i like the fact that on Facebook, you can report bullying and unwanted comments. Doesn't take the fact away that it was said. But it does keep things more positive.
I feel as though apps such as cash app and tik tok can have a major negative effect on most people. Because with all of the filters you can turn your image and yourself into anything you want to be. And i feel as though that will eventually turn into negative effects because images aren't reality, its just a picture. And after you get done editing and fixing yourself how you want to look in the image. Once someone who doesn't know you finally meets you. It will turn into a negative effect for everyone involved.
All in all it just depends on the person and the situation. Because everyone is different in their own way. Some see themselves in a positive way. Other's see themselves in a negative way.
