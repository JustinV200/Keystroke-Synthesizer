In this generation where social media become very popular for young and even adult people. People tend to compare themselves to other people's lives on social media or the people that they know. In my observation, It is often times people always want to do what other people are doing, they also want something what other people have. 

When I was a child, I was very happy. Though we are poor but at that time I was happy having little things. I didn't even know that we were poor because most of the people in my community has almost the same status of living. I didn't have any comparison because we didn't have TV, computer games and internet at that time. I have many sibblings so we didn't even go out to town to eat, watch movie or doing anyting fancy. We never celebrate birthdays too. the only celebration we celebrate are Christmas, New Year and Fiestas. My parents are just farmer but they able to send us from primary school to College. 

When I went to College. That was  the start I started feeling sad that I didn't know many things and I always pitty myself when my friends or classmates telling about their expericences as a child and telling what they had and I can't tell anything because I didn't have those things they are talking about.  At first it was hard knowing that I was poor but it never stop me from studying hard and able to reach my dreams. It was became my insperation and I started to be proud telling about my hardship in life.

Now that I'm old and have everything that makes me happy. I felt proud of myself. I maybe grew up poor but it didn't stop to find my happiness. I think focusing on my personal goal helped me find my happiness. On the other hand what I see in other people happiness is also a good insperation
