Materialism is a big part of today's society.  It shapes who we are and how we behave.  Many actions that people make can be seen as being based off their own materialistic views.  It seems as though society is literally consumed by having the newest, greatest, and shiniest products.

Modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic.  There are many other matters in society that should be of more concern.  If society were to focus less energy on spending money and 'keeping up with the Jones', then I think society would be a more peaceful and happy place.

One of the reasons I think we should criticize society for being materialistic is because of the mental and emotional stress that is caused when members of society aren't able to afford neccessities.  Some might think that it is ok to make unneccessary purchases because they have worked hard to earn money.  While I don't disagree with earning what you worked hard for, I do think we could minimalize our footprint by purchasing less and creating more memories instead.

In conclusion, modern society has become too materialistic and continues to wedge a gap between those that can and those that can't.  This materialism approach has caused a great divide in our society that continues to grow and create animosity among it's members.
