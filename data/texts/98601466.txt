The question prompted here is "Do people achieve more succcess by cooperation or by competition?"
While both methods can acheive great thins, which is reponsible for "more success"?
What does "more success" even mean?
Well, for the purposes of this paper innovation & efficiency will be our metrics.

Competition is built into almost everything we do, and it is one of the major pillers of a great economy & in evolution. 
Competition  spurrs creativity & innovation.
Capitalism is firmly based on compition competing to do the job cheaper & more effectively.
The drawback with competition is that there is inharently a lot of waste created by overlapping efforts, and the ultimate success of only one of these competitors.
Competition can create "rockstars", e.g. people who are exceptional at what they do.

Cooperation is built into almost everything we do aswell.
Much of the world requires our cooperation in order to function.
We must cooperate and agree to follow the rules & laws that apply to us.
Cooperation is the basis for any healthy society.
Cooperation is efficient. 
Instead of everyone competing for themselves, vast amounts of resources, time, energy, and pain are spared.

Cooperation is responsible for the existance of every society that has ever been, so you could argue that it has been used to achieve more success & stability.
Competition creates winners and losers, but it also spurs innovation.

In conclusion, it would seem that cooperation is necessary for stability & efficiency, and competition yields innovation & waste.
Depending on the goal, either competition or cooperation could yield different benefits.
Competition is a tool used to innovate and just get things done.  
It's a means to an end.
Cooperation is a method of utilizing those innovations for the betterment of a group.

In the end a balance of cooperation & competition will result in the best outcome.
