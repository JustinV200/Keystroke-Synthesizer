Modern society should be criticized for being materalistic. Why?  Because modern society as we know it is at a state in technoilogy where you can pick up your cell phone and be able to connect with friends and family, watch movies or  catch up on the news. Or even check out the latest viral video. All while walking down the street or from anywhere you want to go. Society has become too dependent on this technology. 

Technology may be a big factor but its just only one of the reasons. Society has gooten to a point where along with technology we have to share every new pice of clothing or new food dish to our friends and family as well. Some even like to show up by dressing in fancy clothes, or buying expensive luxury cars. Grocery shopping has never been easier then with a click of a button.

I feel we should be critizized as a society for this because we have lost our roots of being able to do things on our own. We are constantly relying on things like the internet to answer any question we have instantly withought having to actually take the time to learn. We can order food and have it delivered instead of going out to get it. It has started to make society too "lazy" Technology and material posessions can be a good thing as well, but anytime you go out in public you will see someone closly tied to their cell phone or someone trying to show off with a fancy new car. People like to show off fancy things. but when you become reliant on it is when things start to go down hill as a society.
