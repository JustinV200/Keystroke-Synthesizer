I enjoy watching my fourteen year old grandson play baseball. He enjoys playing to be part of a team. He is not a super athlete but tries the best he can. Sometimes, it is a struggle to encourage him when he doesn't do as well as some of his teammates. Yes, the game is a competition, but to achieve success your team needs to cooperate with each other. 

I would explain to him that even if one or two players are super players, that doesn't neccessarly assures a win. Those players need to know that if they need some help, their teammates have their back. A good pitcher needs the fielders to be ready. The fielders need to talk to each other when a ball is coming their way. Who is going to catch it? A good hitter needs the other batters to try their best to make an RBI or sacrifice fly. That is the way to win.

Some may say that competition fuels success because most people want to feel they are important enough to be recognized. Sure, it would be great to see my grandson be the star of the team. But would he feel as good about it if his team came in last place? I don't think so. 

What more can I say? I have done my 200 words and my three paragraphs and feel I accomplished my assignment. So I guess I will say that my grandson still feels bad when he does not get a hit or misses a catch. I try to encourage him by saying that he is still contributing to the team and everyone is just trying their best. The most important thing is for him to have fun and comradarie.
