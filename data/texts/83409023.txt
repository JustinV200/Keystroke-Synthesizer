From the pirates to the kings and queens to a child at the store materialism is a driving force. Materialism has been woven into society since the beginning of time. The seamtress at the hem of that weaving is capitalism.

 Modern society should not be materialistic because it takes away the priority of man and his gifts. No matter how talented a person might be it is hard for every talented person to make a living off of that talent because it may not be directly or instantly beneficial to anyone. In this society people are less concerned about who you are than they are about what you can do for them.

Materialism has lead to many downfalls of man. From settlers constantly taking land because they could not share with kind native american to over production that has brung the earth to its knees with climate change. Materialism has numbed our society to achievement. There is always more to do and more to get. The people most effect my this is the younger generations. They can see more of what other have through social media. Since a select few have become millionaries in their early 20s or pretend to be. they believe they have to have it all figured out. They forget how valuable just waking up in the morning is. 

In conculsion materialism  has taken away societies happiness and replaced it with gratification. Gratification is not content, it does not last. Until majority belives that they are enough and they have done enough there will always be another material thing to harp over. For now many have traded in memories for receipts.
