Status, the desire of anyone living in a modern society. To achieve status you must prove to society your achievements and the most common method of doing this is through material. Society is often criticized for being materialistic, but the ones who criticize people for being materialistic are more than likely unable to achieve a high status themselves. 
Firstly, achieving great things should be bragged and shown off by those who have done so. Whether they decide to do this through expensive purchases not doing so at all, they should not be criticized for it. Accomplishments of previous generations have lead us to where we stand now, yet people want to judge the great people who attained high status for being materialistic? Wealthy business owners have done more for communities and societies plenty more than people truly realize, such as donating to charities, and get no praise. Fine, who cares. But if they acquire high value possessions, they are judged for being greedy. However, there are those without status or great achievements who boast about their possessions and may deserve to be criticized for it. But if their families achieved great things and spoiled the younger generation, why should anyone outside of that family care? What wealthy people do with their money shouldn't be anyones business and no one should bear jealousy toward them.
Materialism is a term that leads lower status/valued people into judging others for things they haven't or chosen not to attain.  People shouldn't be criticized for having possessions because it only leads to jealousy and hatred by those groups who lack the value to own high value possessions. The criticization of materialism is a toxic stereotype that will achieve nothing for anyone.
