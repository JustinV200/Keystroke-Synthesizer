Advertising of products are important  to sell the product.  This includes people, packaging, pricing and location of where the product can be found. These create images and impressions which affect buyers to purchase the product. 
 Colorful packaging attract a buyer. The fancy packaging attracts the buyers. They then forget to look at the details of the product uses. The product is sold and the maker, store and consumer are happy.
Famous people are great at drawing attention to products also. This could be people in your community, actors, musicians or even sick people.  This is important as it appeals to the social nature and emotions of people.  They get lost in wanting to support the person instead of if the item is really needed and if it is suited to their needs. The item is sold and the retailer and consumer are happy. 
The pricing of a product is so important for the sale of the product. The pricing does not matter as long as a person can afford it and want to buy it. Credit also helps to sell items. Unlike persons who think credit should only be used for important things like educations, cars and houses most people will credit the item if they think it is a necessary purchase and makes them happy.
The location of where an item is sold is so important. It could be in a regular retail place but unusual places like a coffee shop, the airport, a sidewalk vendor, the farmers market all bring exposure to the product and thus increases its chance to be sold. 
All in all images and impressions are necessary for the publicity and sale of a product.g
