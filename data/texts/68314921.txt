Goal setting is one of the basic quality of a human inorder to lead life in a exciting way. Without setting a goal a person's life will be as uninteresting as a slow paced thriller without any twists and turns. If we set a goal and work towards it, in our way we may overcome many obstacles, sorrows, pains or even we may get any kind of trouble that forces us to stop running towards our goal. But if we don't stop for the troubles, overcome it and win in attaining our goal then the sorrows caused will all go away and our happiness will come as a rain in a summer season.

I would like to share few of the obstacles caused by ourselves and our enemies. Few things that stops us from obtaining our goal by ourselves are laziness, trusting wrong persons and getting cheated by them, weaker emotions, non - punctual, etc.. and by our enemies are also the same where ourselves in the sense on our own whereas by them in the sense the same things can be also done by them.

When we work towards our own goal the happiness we get after achieving it will be 10 times more than the struggles that we had to overcome on the process of reaching it. But whereas if we work for happiness of our trustable and loved ones it's our happiness included with their happiness. Imagine just our happiness is 10 times more than the struggles then if others is also included how much it would be greater. Its actually double the joy and happiness.
