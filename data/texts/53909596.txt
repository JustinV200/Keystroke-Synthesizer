Absolutely most of the people will accept this comment. Because our mind slowly processed compared to what we see. For an example we went to the supermarket we saw some products for bodycare or any other products what is the first thing will affect us, undoubtedly image of the pack. after that we search what type of product is this and ingredients. Like this sometimes we make decision by the what we see from the outside maybe in future it could be wrong decision. First impressions are created a major effect on people sometimes they blindly believe in that.
But yes its hard to change our way of behavior and change our thoughts and drag them into the truth behind them.But some people will do that. They know what they see is not true.they analyzing things that what was the real truth behind that. Not only the products also in real life incidents too. Life will teach us by what experienced in only out and out appearence.
Everyone believe what they saw but most important thing in this was we have to be careful before what we believe. Because not everything as same as what it look alike. it suits for buying things or making decisions too. so we have be careful before make a decision. Apart all from that people mostly affect on what they see first. we doesn't even know if its change or not because its organicly happen like kids wants the chocolate from outside impressive colours
