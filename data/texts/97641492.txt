  Materialism is the act of obtaining possessions with money. Everyone owns something. A material item could be your necklace, your action figure, or your mug with a terrible and corny saying on it. These possessions that people decide to spend their financials on bring them joy and happiness. But there is criticism that comes along with your purchases. I believe people should be able to spend what they have however they want. 
  I work hard. I sweat my butt off to make my money. At the end of week, i find myself purchasing a new comic, or perhaps, a new action figure. What else am I to spend my money on after bills are paid? As long as my bills are paid, i can freely spend my money how i see fit. You see all of these rappers on social media flexing their gold chains. Some post pictures or vidoes of their shoes, million dollar homes, and their fancy cars. But all that matters is that they're happy.
  Some may believe that people too materialistic should be using their money to help others, such as the issue of homelessness. But i don't believe that. I think people should help themselves if they can. I believe people, just like me, should be able to spend their hard earned money on whatever they would like. 
  At the end of the day, modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Everyone should mind their own business and focus on themselves. Hard-earned money should be spent freely if it benefits the spender emotionally and mentally.
