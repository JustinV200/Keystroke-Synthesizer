I support success through competition. Because only competition makes a person focused on a task and cooperation makes a person somewhat lethargic in their actions. So I support competiton, it makes a person feel his self confidence. Competition brings out the real power of a man. It makes a person to work hard and attain the goal without others help.

Competition is the best medicine for self motivation. Competition self motivates us to bring out the best of what we are doing. In this competitive world everyone should compete with each other to taste the success. No one should beleive others, everyone should be focused on their goal and work hard to achieve that. In this world everything is competition, we grow up in a society where competition speaks more than cooperation.

We have heard many stories on cooperation brings success. But in the real world competition only brings success. As a child we compete with others to get better grades in school and then after school we compete with others to get better grade in college. And it never ends then it continues even when we search for job. During job interview we compete with others to get a good job with higher pay. So I conclude that competition brings more success than cooperation do.
