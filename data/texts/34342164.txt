I'm not good at putting my thoughts down on "paper".  I think that in today's society we all are bombarded with so much information online.  It's only natural that we make such snap judgments about what we see.  Not many people have the time or discipline  to really dig deep and look beneath the surface. 

There are many reasons why advertising is so effective.  Years of algorithms and online data of populations have given companies insight in to what people deem important, what people spend time on.  In today's online world click bait is prevalent for one reason, it works.  Attention grabbing headlines are what draws the most interest.  I'm not sure how we combat it.  I see kids today that are addicted more or less to apps like Twitter and TikTok.  TikTok specifically is geared toward grabbing someone's attention in seconds.  The videos that don't do this fail to go viral.  Our society has become more and more geared toward fake false impressions.

Technology is a blessing and a curse.  We've always elected politicians based on how "good-looking" and charismatic they are, not based on their positions.  It's even worse today.  People make millions from posting fake lives on instagram.  It depresses the average person working a job they only tolerate for a paycheck.  They see images of people in setup locations and think this is reality for most.  

It's more important than ever for people to educate themselves.  Schools are not teaching critical thinking but there is a world of information at a person's fingertips if they want to find it.  If people don't look past the surface of today's click-bait culture we will continue to descend into a society more obsessed than ever with appearances.
