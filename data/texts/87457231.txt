 People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals other than focusing on the happiness of others. If you focus on pursuing your goals and you are actually dedicated to achieve them, then you will help yourself in the long run. Being happy is feeling or showing pleasure or contentment.  I feel that everyone will be more happy if the are content and stable.

 Although some may feel that other people's happiness makes them happy , I feel as though these are the people who are actually content and stable with everything th eneed and maybe more . I think that you can't be happy focusing on others and not your owns because everyone that your are focusing on is working on pursuing their owns goals to make themselves happy ,not you. 

 I think that you can still be happy by seeing other people you love happy , but I don't think it will make you more happy than you would be after focusing on your own personal goals and how you can get better , smarter, richer , and wiser!  Everyone has their own life to live so you should focus on being the best verison of you first and be completely happy with yourself . Only you can control your happiness .
