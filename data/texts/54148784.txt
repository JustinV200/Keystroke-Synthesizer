The ability to see is one of the greatest gifts gad gave us.Perception is the next important thing our brain manifests through sight. Vision is the primest in every aspect of life. This can be concluded by the popularity of video sharing website like YouTube, Instagram compared to audio sharing websites like Clubhouse or Napster.

I definitely think that images and impressions have a very big effect on people. Since knowing this, I always believe there is something always hidden from what is being seen by us. This made me being up a question - " Whats hidden behind this?" to almost every event of my life.

Recently, I saw an advertisement aired by Bell's Scotch whiskey. It lasted 2 good minutes and it mainly showed how an un-educated father learns English to read the book published by his son. The whole ad gave me very good vibes and made me feel good about the character and without much of my knowledge, the brand being sold to me(whiskey). In the end of the ad, the son , happy that his father was able to read and appreciate his work, asks the person in the pub to give his father a glass of Bell's.I was taken aback when unknowingly, I favored the brand and fell in to the trap of the marketer. This ad has been a huge hit and this helped me conclude that many people fell into the same trap - the trap of impression.

I would like to conclude saying that the exploiters take advantage of our weaknesses. So, it's important we dont believe everything we see but instead try to see the hidden things in every aspect of life.
