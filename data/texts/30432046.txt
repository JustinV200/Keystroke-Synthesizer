Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on People? People have been debating this question forever, but we still don't have a claer answer. Why? because the answer is not simple. it doe not have a black-white type of answer.

Andry Aggassi, a famous tennis player, once said: image is everything. He played tennis and dressed in style, even his hair was in style, too. He had a very successful tennis carrer and became a very-much-loved tennis player in the world.

When Obama was running for Office. Mnay people, especially women, loved him because he appeared so handsome. I don't have any intention to say that Obama became the president because of his good appearance. If he is not capable, he could not became the president. However, being good-looking probably gave him an edge.

Therefore, I think good appearance give people advantage to succeed. However, if one only has good appearance but no quality to do the job, s/he might just get popularity for a short time, and then fade. If Andry aggassi didn't play tennis well, and Obama didn't do his job well, they couldn't be successful. Good appreance is only good to some extent. The most important is one's overall quality. We should pay attention to our images, but we should also try to improve ourselves to be a better person.
