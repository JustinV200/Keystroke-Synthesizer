     Sucess can be achieve through the promotion of competition or cooperation. I believe that people can achieve more success by cooperation. When people cooperate together, whether at work or during play, they combine their individual ideas and skills in an effort to come up with one successful idea that works for everyone. The participation in a group that cooperates can boost the success of individuals who would not otherwise have the ability to speak up alone.
  
     Cooperation works better than competition when working toward success because in competition people work against each other and do not share their ideas. When ideas are not shared it narrows the options to achieve a desired outcome. Individuals who do not have their ideas chosen feel like they have lost the competition and may result in sad or upset feelings associatted with failure. They also may not feel confident enough to share their ideas during othertimes in their life.

     Working together and cooperating to acheieve a desired outcome can result in many people feeling good about their ideas and all of the people involved in the success of their achievements feel like they have won instead of just one person feeling like they have won. The power of success using many ideas and skill sets can implement a significant long lasting feeling of accomplishment and help boost the confidence of people to share their ideas and skills in other areas throughout their life. I believe this is the best way to promote lasting success and the feeling of accomplishment and victory.
