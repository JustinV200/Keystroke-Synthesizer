When asked if people achieve more success by cooperating or by competition, I think of the saying, there is no I in team. So, I think that people definitely achieve more success through cooperating with each other rather than competing against each other. Reason being is it shows support for each other. When you show support for each other, you stregnthen and build each other up.

This brings me to my next point of how cooperating with each other can help people achieve success. When you feel stregnthen or build up through support, it encourages one another and gives one the motivation to carry on or do better. This in turn encourages others to ecourage someone else. It has a ripple affect, and produces a healthy working environment. 

Not saying that competiotion is all bad. In fact, competion can motivate and bring out an individuals' strengths. However, if the environment is all competion where everyone is out for themselves, then this can produce a toxic environment. No one can function properly in an unhealthy, toxic environment. As a result this will produce an uproductive environment. One where it is doomed to fail. No one man is an island. Meaning that as an individual the accomplishment is small or unsuccessful. On the other hand, as a team, the accomplishment is larger and more successful.
