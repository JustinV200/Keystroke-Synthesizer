I believe that images and impressions do have too much effect on people. Let's look at the shopping world, and how manufacturers package items. The more colorful and eye catching a package is, the more a person, especially a child, is going to want the item. If a package was drab and unappealing, it would make people less apt to buy the item that is packaged in said packaging.

Let's look at the child aspect of things. A child is not going to necessarily pick an item that is packaged in a drab and gray package, because it is not eye catching, and they will definitely lose interest in the item very quickly. That is why most toy manufacturers are packaging toys in colorful packages, so that children will beg their parents to buy the item for them.

Even adults can be swayed by the color and how eye catching a package is. If the color is drab, the adult could view the item as boring and old, which would lead them away from wanting to buy the item. Manufacturers seem to stick with the bold and colorful packaging, just so they can catch the eye of the anticipated consumer, and make them more likely to buy the product that they are trying to sell.

These are some of the main reasons why I believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. If people view things negatively, it is going to lead them away from whatever it is that doesn't really catch their eye.
