Happiness is sought for and achieved in a variety of different ways. A single persons happiness may be found in possessions, relationships, or life events. One thing that is consistent across all people is that we all strive for happiness in some way. Individuals that choose to and enjoy making others happy will find the most happiness within their own life.

If a person is selfish in their happiness they will tend to not have very many people in their corner. When they find they can't do something on their own not only will they be left helpless but they may find themselves discouraged that they are not strong or smart enough alone. Many people will remember if a certain person has done them a favor or helped them along the way. In this respect, they also will take notice to those around them being selfish and only working towards their personal goals. Those who worry about their own personal goals more than helping peers/people around them may find themselves without many if any true friends or people they can count on. 

Often, people find happiness in helping others becuase we are social individuals. Many interactions throughout our life involve others in our family, friend groups, and communities. If we see that someone from our family is struggling it is our natural response to help them. To ignore their need or cries for help goes against our natural instinct to keep civilization alive and well. A person can take comfort knowing that they made a difference in someone elses life even if they themselves did not complete a goal that specific day. 

It is becuase of our humanity that people can find happiness in helping others. We were given brains capable of feelings, thoughts, and language so that we as a society can help each other succeed. Being selfish will only cause one to feel alienated, lonely, and unhappy in the long run.
