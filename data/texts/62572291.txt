Introduction:
                    It is really important that people should follow their own goals to achieve more. But life won't allow everyone to chase their goals. Because of situations, people are deviated from their goals. However the balancing of enjoying the life and chasing their goals is really imortant in my view.

Position:
                   In this content there are two positions. One is achieving their own goals and the other one is balancing the life for others who depends you. Both are important. Sometimes people aggressively follows their goals and they don't take care about their well wishers. I won't appreciate this. This life is not only for us.

Reasons and evidences:
                  This life is not permanent. We couldn't predict how long it is. So enjoying the life as much as possible and helping others should be the primary thing. I also suggest that for this we shouldn't lose our goals, but living for others is the purpose of life. We can also get satisfied with it.

Counter arguments: 
                   Some peopel will question this statement and say that life is for themselves first. It is true. We shouldn't leave our goals for that. But shouldn't stay in the same place for that goal.

Conclusion:
                   So in my view, we should make our life happy and we should go for it and try to make others happy as much as possible.
