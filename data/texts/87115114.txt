     In today's ever growing social class, materialism is practically the way of living now. However, modern society is still criticized for it in many ways. When asked if I agree with the previous statement, my answer is a clear no. From the technological advancements to the array of captivating new styles, keeping up with trends is our way of living now. To criticize that would be to criticize the world as a whole. Some people ,(influencers), actually enjoy buying things and influence others to buy as well.
     In order to function in todays world everything has a price. The hot new phone or the trendy coat are all small examples of things consumers purchase yet are considered materialistic. Being materialistic is even way of some peoples livelihood. Think influencers and brand ambassadors. Their only job is to buy and pursuade you to buy. Without materialism we wouldnt have a demand for products. 
    To conclude, materialism is a broad label usually only seen as a very specific one.  Being materialistic is a part of the way we live now. Everyone buys and everyone sells. We all benifit from it. Modern society should not be criticized for it and should instead be embraced for it.
