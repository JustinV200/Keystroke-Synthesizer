Since the beginning of time human beings have studied themseleves to better understand why they act in the ways that they do. The understandings we have reached over time have been utilized for a wide variety of reasons, some more inoccent than others. 
Perhaps the most visible of these reasons is represented in advertising, an adaptation of propaganda techniques utilized to induce people to purchase products that they neither need nor, in many cases, can afford. Marketers have perfected the craft of using our own psycholigical traits into causing us to act against our own best interests.
They have utilized the concept of people's tendancies to think in images and not words. After all, a picture tells a thousand words and with modern technology images can be sent to us at staggering rates. We can be convinced that the perfect most desirable traits can be found in any product without the need to convey any actual verifyable information.
Over time modern humans find themselves subjected to an unbearable onslaught of images and messaging that comes at us from virtually every direction. Images fade into the background where they work on our subconsious without our even being aware. 
Thus we find that all of our yardsticks are all corrupted with subtle misinformation. If we follow our own instincts we are repeatedly led to disappointment. Time and again we follow the obvious course of action, laid out for us even though we may be unaware, and we are met with results we did not want or expect. 
Resistance becomes an induced reaction, rejecting the messaging the norm. The resulting effects on society is a cynical and listless population spiraling in unproductive and futile circles. When everything is a lie and all roads lead noplace why listen at all? The damage to the cohesion of the at large community is becoming clearer. Perhaps we need to step back and turn down the subliminal and focus more on objective content.
