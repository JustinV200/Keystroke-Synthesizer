                        In my opinion modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic this is because everyone in this world are unique they have their own opinions about something else. we should not say that they should be materialistic or they should not be materialistic. materialistic is the sense believing everything we see i guess so this may be both positive and negative. positive in the sense we can make interpersonal relationship with more peoples and negative in the sense it makes like expect the unexpected.          
                     Materialistic and spritual values both are opposite to each other. when we give importance to spiritual then sometimes it makes us blind and we don't think about anything else rather than spiritual. we only use to say about God all the times. And again it is subjective it is the the thing the person wants to decide we can't decide because it is their life they only knows what are all the problems and situations they face and they came out of it.
                        Being materialistic is not that much wrong thing and also being spiritual  is not that much wrong both are good for someone and bad for someone.it is according to the individuals who like spiritual and materialistic.
