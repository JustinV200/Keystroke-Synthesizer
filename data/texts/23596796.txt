Many people achieve success in both cooperation and/or competition in both work and play settings with one another around them. I personally find in my experiences in these scenarios that competition has tended to create more success for both myself and others around me involved. Competition just is natural for us humans to endure and compete in amongst one another when doing the same tasks, sports, trivia, whatever it may be that we as a group are amongst one another doing. 

Engaging together, creating rivalry, and trying to out-do one another to be noticed as the best of all the others doing the same thing is something that I think is safe to accurately say is something anybody in said scenario would want as a result. Nobody wants to appear to be less good at something than someone else, and we would always want and choose to be number one versus number two, three, etc. As Ricky Bobby from the movie Talledaga Nights says, "If you're not first, you're last!". I feel exactly this way. 

I think it is just human nature as I previously stated that make it that we just perform better when competing in many things with one another than by cooperation scenarios that play out. Competition is what fuels our drive to push through and produce the results to raise the bar in whatever it may be to get to that number one position and come out on top and above others competing with you. Nobody wants to fail and that is just that. To be recognized for having a talent that outshines others is something we all strive for when competitive. For example, Just writing this prompt, in my mind I am thinking how I hope to have done a better job than others who are doing this same prompt.
