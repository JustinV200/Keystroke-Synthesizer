We've all felt that excited feeling when we buy a new car, are about to purchase a new home, walk to the cashier with the perfect new pair of shoes or a new phone. But, are these material items really bringing us happiness? How long does the happiness last after we have acquired something new? Do we ever have enough? Historically, humans have not always been stuck in the endless loop of materialism. To answer these questions, modern society should be analyzed to determine if materialism is positive or negative for society as a whole.

Modern times have brought about advances in marketing and consumer psychology that have taken advantage of humans and have made us feel as if we need to collect more and more and that only by acquiring more possessions will we be happy. However, it was not always this way. There was a time when people acquired only what they needed. But, were these people happy? We can probably assume that people that lived before materialism set were able to find ways to be happy in their lives. But can we compare their level of happiness to the general level of happiness of people today? 

If we can compare humans' levels of happiness between current society and pre-materialistic society, we will be able to find out if materialism is driving our society and general levels of happiness downward. If materialism is contributing to people's general unhappiness, it is fair to say that modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic. Material items may be bringing unhappiness to people in many ways, both direct and indirect. Not only does the initial excitement of getting something new wear off quickly, also the manufacturing of these items may be harming our world in ways that are also negative for society. If we stop this push for material goods, hopefully people will be able to find true happiness that relationships and experiences can bring.
