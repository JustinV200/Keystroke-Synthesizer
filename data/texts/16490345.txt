       Individuals in general are being more materialist in the modern days. Lately it is rare to see someone�that do not�like going shopping or someone that do not buy more things that they need. There are several studies that show that being part of the materialism does not bring hapiness and materialist people should be criticized.
      Acquiring new things and spending money is part of our society. That is why we live in a capitalist country but when things get out of control, suchs as people working extra hours in order to pay for the bills that they have spent more than they should, it is not a health way to live. Individuals that care too much about material things should stop and rethink deeply about their lifestyle.  Imagine life 50 years ago, people had much less access to products and much less desire to acquire new items and even though they have a great life.
     Nowadays our society has the desire to be the first one to have some types of products and a variety of items to make them happy. If they do not go shopping means for then depression and then they live like slave from their own habits which is very hard to get out.
  When an individual sets up their life prioritizing material things they should be criticized because life means much more than that. Others aspects of life should be more important and significant for all human beings than just buying products. Unfortunately our society has a great impact on the individual's mind by not letting them be what they want to be.
