   Happiness can be found in many ways and describes in even more. I have not found a particular sytem to make myself happy but I have tried enough to have an opinion on it. Focusing on your own goals seems like that would be the way to go to attain happiness, while most people benefit from the reward system our brain has for us by doing acts of kindness or improving humanity. The only answer to the correct path to happiness has to be a balance of both.
   Workng toward long term goals and staying focused on what you want is a great way to get what you want, but the journey there isn't always a happy one, and there's the issue that what we want changes as our values change in life. Devoting time and energy to improve others lives can be very gratifying and rewarding but this takes time  and energy away from what you can devote toward what will make you personally comfortable and happy. Overdoing this can also can lead to a neglect of your own personal needs all together. 
   People can have strict beliefs on which direction to take to attain happiness and the experiences that have led them to these beliefs will be very different for each individual, so there is no way for one to judge the correctness of how another goes about this. 
   Often we find our happiness only in hindsight, realizing after the fact, what made us truly happy was not what we expected beforehand. What it comes down to is how we percieve things and the only thing that makes us happy or keeps us from happiness is how we look at it. All you can do is stay true to yourself and your values because what makes someone else happy is almost guarenteed  to not be the same for you. If you do what others say you should do, or seek what other people tell you will make you happy, you will fall short when looking back on happy you have been.
