             Yeah I agree that the modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because they are losing their happiness and purpose of living. It is the human nature that 'nothing is enough'. Even a person earns more money and spends it for happiness the eager of earning money gets more prioritized than that happiness, thus they ends up in the disturbed state and unable to concentrate in their personal life and social life. Materialism that is acquiring possessions and spending money makes a person more disturbed when it is placed in a high need than basic needs. Thus its need to be limited.
              In the olden days people prioritize happiness than any other factors like money and materialism thus they lived more years. But in these years people prioritize money and materialism than happiness and thinks that these two factors are the ones helps to be happy that is completely wrong. This wrong prioritization leads to greediness and unsatisfaction of their lives.
              At the end I conclude that everyone in this modern society should learn to live with what we have and praise the lord for what we have and be happy. We should learn to live like our ancestors to live lot years.
