Happiness is something that one can feel from the depth of their heart and everyone need the most. Not everyone can experience same feelings from a particular action, since each human is independant and free-thinking. For some people money can bring happiness; while for others, doing charity work might bring happiness. But commonly we can say that success brings happiness for most of the people. There are few who don't even take success for granted. 

The level of happiness also vary from person to person. If 100 dollars is given to a group of people, Some might feel very happy, some might feel less worth, while few won't bother it. It is not based on single thing one can define happiness. It varies from person to person, moment, value, success rate, and so on.
Kids are the one who experience most of the happiness,they feel happy even for very simple reason. A small piece of chocolate will bring happiness for kids. On the same case, For an adult you need to invest some big amount or moment to bring happiness like a luxury car or a perfect guy/girl. Also when you grew older, you either find happiness in little things or nothing can bring happiness to you. Its completely based on your adulthood life. Also there some cases, where doing bad to others will bring happiness to few people. Happiness completely depends on ones true nature.

So don't run after something that you think it'll bring happiness. Happiness is everywhere, only the thing is that you have to admire it. Feel the happiness in every single moment of life. Life is full of joy untill youn persue it. Nothinh could stop from persuing your happiness.
