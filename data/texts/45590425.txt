Survival of the fittest is an adage that is well known. In the animal world,competiton for scarce resources is the law of the land. Animals are born with innate skills that are augmented with education an animal gets in the wild as he or she grows. Competiton is the only path to survival .  It is true that some animals hunt in packs but  nature has many more solitary pedators. In the human world, competiton is a state that can enable  a person to achieve success,  , stature, prestige and accomplishment.

Competiton as an instrument of success, in human has a biological component that enables the human to perform at a a higher level than he might otherwise be capable of. In a state of competition where stressors are present, the human body produces adrenaline. Adrenaline is a chemical in the body that increases one 's heartbeat, and often times heightens the physical strength , focus and capabilities of the individual . Scientific experimants have proven this to be true,

Some may say that cooperation is a better way to achieve succecess. I declare that we need only turn our attention to the United Sates Congress with its kumbaya call for cooperation. This does not appear to be a motivating factor for passing legislation. I daresay, the best way to effect changes , is to have all Congreesmen and women feel the breath of competiton from a worthy competitor all too ready to usurp their spot. Competiton, with a bit of fear would be a better motivator for achievemment in Congress.

Competiton spurs one on, and promotes pride,  self reliance and personal accomplishment. One knows thier own skills.
