Materialism should have no place in modern society.  It does nothing more than cause issues on many arenas.  A life in modern times would be a happier, more productive one without materialism.

I believe that we should do our best to do away with materialism.  "Keeping up with the Jones" is not something anyone should aim for,  In my honest opinion the only way to lasting happiness is doing away ideals of materialism.

There are many reasons that can be verified and stated to go against materialism.  Rampant issues with debt and inequality are two of the biggest reasons to turn away from materialism.  Americans in particular go further into debt daily in the name of materialism.  Everything from homes, to clothes, and or food people go into debt to acquire is an example.  The issue of inequality is another factor that works against materialism.  A blue collar worker, or someone of minority status deserves the same items and lifestyles as that of the CEO, they put in the same amount of effort and work.

The ideal of working hard for the ability to be materialistic is one arguement that is in favor of materialism.  Its so intertwined with the ideas of freedom and what America stands for.  We openly teach this to our youth, that if you work hard the bility to be materialistic is one of the just rewards.

In the end materialism does more harm than good.  It would be nice if we could move to a society void of it.  Until that happens we much try to individually work in our own lives in that direction.
