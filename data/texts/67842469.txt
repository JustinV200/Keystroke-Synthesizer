The modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. 
First of all, it's not only modern society that are materialistic. The development of human being involved acquiring materials and pocessions, getting more food, wear warmer clothes. It's embedded in human instinct. 
Secondly, being materialistic helps the development of our society. Because we want more material things, better processes are developed, better tools are invented, more knowledge are passed on. Without wanting more materials, or being more 'greedy', people will be satisfied in whatever they have and no advance will be made or efford will be used. 
Thirdly, to be honest, we do need materials and we do prefer better quality ones. What's wrong with that? Do we have to all be homeless and pennyless? Will that be a normal society? If there is no pursue of material, what else would people do? Read books? Well, even that you need to acquire the books, physically or digitally. Day dream? Is that better way to use your time and energy? 
Overall, I think there is nothing wrong for being materialistic. It's good for the society, it's good for each individual. Without it, the modern society will not advance and will even go backward.
