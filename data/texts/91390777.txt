The pursuit of happiness is something that most of us strive for in our everyday lives.  There are some that feel that happiness is primarily obtained when they reach personal goals while for others, the true sense of joy is when those around them are experiencing happiness.  Although both are valid and viable reasons, it is those that seek and help others to be happy that eventually find thier own true happiness.

If one has ever been part of a charity drive it is quite evident that the recipients of these donations are quite happy.  The joy that they exhibit is quite contagious and is quickly felt by all those that are participants to include volunteers.  Giving gifts is much better than receiving it and this also pertains to happiness.  By passing on happiness or making others feel joy, especially when it is for a good cause or to benefit humanity, you will surely receive it back ten-fold.   

For many of us it is important to be independant, successful and of course pursue our own dreams of happiness.  There are different paths that can be followed to achieve these goals however it has been proven time and time again, that when one focuses on helping other with finding their happiness the rewards reaped back by you will be significant more.
