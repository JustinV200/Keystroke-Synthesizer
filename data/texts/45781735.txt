   Its very important that we have to choose the way how we become successful. success doesn't come easy we chase and fight for the dream to success. Guess what this is a competitive world so we need to compete against the one everything we had. it should be a job , buisness on everything we need to competite the coperation is a good thing to but cooperation is not the only one gives success it doest not last long. It just a dreamy situation we creates that is not miracle just a passing clouds. 
   so we need talent to competite  so lets think its national spelling bee so competition everywhere any games we nedd competitive people who competite against everything they had.They put their effort life and win aginst all the struggles. Till it gets success that the point about how much  above we try.
  From my thoughts acompetitive mind give more success than the cooperative minds on my opinion but when we combine competitive mind with coopration it gives massive success more than anything we could imagine. Lets try out be people we need to be both minds i like that type very much  more than anything i personally do.
