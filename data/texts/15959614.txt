yes it is true some people promote competition as the only way to achieve the success because they think if we compete with others it will make us success it may be true for sometimes. but in my point of view it depends upon the person if a person thinks that he or she might win or achieve success only through competiting with others then he or she can follow that to achieve his or her success. 
             by the same time some or more people will think cooperation and hardwork will make them as success it is also true in my point of view. Because achieving sucess depends on individual the effort or strategies or less important the thing is he or she achieved or not that matters for all. the people only see the success of the person rather than seeing their efforts or strategies. but by saying that competition will involvs ideas or skills that how to win others is may be the advantage of being competent to others.
                     but as said in a complex world coopertion is much more likely to produce significant and lasting accomplishments it is also true as already said in the paragraph. the answer for the question do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition is both is my answer for this questions.
