Some people believe spending time accumulating things is harmful for our well being. After all, many philosphers have told us that money cannot buy us love or happiness. But I believe that, in acquiring possessions and spending money can, in fact, lead to a more fulfilling life.
In order for one to legal acquire objects, one typically exchanges money for these goods and services. These objects become a physical representation of our hard earned money. When we spend our earned money, we are encouraged to continue working so we can acquire more things. For example, if a teenager is given his first car, he is excited at first but the thrill wears off. If the teenager had to work all summer for the car, he is proud of himself for what he has achieved. That car is his and every time he tells someone that his satisfaction grows.
The idea that money cannot buy love or happiness is a platitude to make poor people feel better about their low incomes. Money cannot buy happiness but it can buy healthcare and a comfortable house to live in. Money insures you won't be cold or hungry. Likewise, physical objects cannot give you love but they can help you express your love. A wedding ring, a new pet, a book by a favorite author: these are things that will be cherished by the receipient. Showing love through acts is as important as professing love.
Many people have possessions that have sentimental value, items that are considered priceless. Photographs of relatives, a book of favorite recipes, letters from dear friends, journals. Would our lives truly be better if we threw these away? How often have these items provided comfort and joy by simply being held?
Materialism taken to the extreme is harmful for the environment and those who pursue money for its sake often end up corrupt and lonely. But owning things that make your life easier or bring joy to others can enrich your life. And what is life but the pursuit of happiness?
