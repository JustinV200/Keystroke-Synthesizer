Society is fully submerged in the digital age. From birth we are now exposed to, surrounded by, and immersed in TV screens, cell phone screens, smart watches, the list goes on. Our children are learning early on that the excitement is no longer in climbing a tree or digging in sand. It's all about what mommy and daddy are holding in their hand and what has them so mesmorized? 
It's the glamour, it's the individualized ads, it's the 10 second clips of fluffed emotion that caters to our thoughts and preferences. This not-so-new age is majorly affecting our abilities to differentiate "our world" from reality. We "like", "retweet", and "upvote" based on our opinions and are actually subconsciously blocking our minds from what's on the other side of the door. We are ultimately allowing ourselves to be part of a great deception.
For example, my husband makes a comment that he thinks it may be time to upgrade our fridge. We are then both bombarded with short visual ads that we NEED a new refrigerator! The latest technology is a must-have, far superior, and advanced. In reality there is nothing wrong with our fridge except the fact that the ice maker doesn't perform to our ideal. But the constant images of something "better" and the underlying idea that what we have is "no longer good enough" has now gone from a planted seed to a rapidly growing weed. 
The marketing industry no longer has to send subliminal messages. It no longer needs to be secretive. It knows we are in a mass-hysteria consumption mindset. The only thing that needs to be done is the inundation of hype with keywords... And allow us to sell ourselves. Which inevitably will happen.
