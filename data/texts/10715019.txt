Some may wonder if we achieve more by cooperation or by competition.  While cooperation is necessary in our daily lives, maybe competition is what pushes us to do more.  Cooperation is more short term when competition is what gives us our lasting accomplishments.  Imagine your dream job, what steps would you take to get there?  Of course it may take some help and cooperation but the one that is climbing is you and you're taking those steps to improve and rise above.

At times, followers find comfort simply with cooperation.  It is the leaders that move forward, willing to compete and make bigger strides in life.  This leaves those that only cooperate to sit still in time with most of them not reaching their goals.  

You may argue though, that cooperation is the first step to push you into competition.  That you wouldn't be where you are if it you didn't have the help.  It seems that the two can also go hand in hand throughout your success.  One may use both cooperation and competition to stay successful, but losing one would make them fall.  Perhaps they would have done better getting where they are though with simple competition and not using cooperation.

In conclusion I think it's very situational and it depends on certain personality types.  You will see people who only compete do great things but they are not always the greatest people.  Most people need others in their lives and it takes cooperation to make you want to compete. It also takes cooperation to grow stronger in a group competing as one.  Then you see people like me that simply cooperate and live just to be comfortable and around the onese I love because that's enough for me.  Maybe it's more about how you measure the success in your own life.
