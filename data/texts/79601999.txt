It is entirely true that society is materialistic.  Citizens heed the commercialization of all products and give in to such leanings. However, while the citizen may not be entirely to blame for giving in to a media and culture, they do have the ability to fight against these phenomenons, and while difficult, this is not impossible.  The prioritization of ease is the primary factor that makes modern society guilty and worthy of criticism for materialism, as they are too weak and reluctant to fight these.

While materialism is enticing, it also has clear pitfalls.  One can see unhealthy messages, wastes of time and energy, and a poor prioritizing as a result of this focus on acquistion. Instead of giving in to such issues, the individual must resist commercial marketing, and can indeed do so.  However, they are unlikely to do so, and it is uncommonly found.  Instead, in their search for comfort and ease, they submit to these materialist urges, and in doing so they become further embedded in the family and social lifestyle, ultimately a norm that is not to be challenged.  Society as a whole is a series of individuals continuing to make the choice of ease over ideal.

While society is influenced by a variety of outside sources, it is a collection of individuals with some levels of autonomy.  Society thus is to be blames for accepting harmful materialist messages and living in accordance.
