     Americans often think that they will achieve happiness when they reach their life goals, often expressed in terms of wealth, financial security and a stable family life. A good retirement, perhaps, or maybe power and influence over issues that are important to them. These measures of happiness can be elusive, however. What if one does not get what one wants? What if one meets those goals, what is next? The answer to both is to balance individual goals and striving towards them with selfless concern for others, including the planet itself.

     Evidence that compassionate living brings benefits is anecdotal, but telling. Those who help others without expecting something in return report having less sadness and depression and more contentment in their lives. Focusing on the happiness of others brings them out of themselves and their daily concerns, and makes them feel a part of something bigger, more universal than individual happiness. The happiness they find in acts of compassion does not come from achieving anything, but from changing their perspective to encompass others, maybe even the entire world.

     This change is perspective is necessary in order to tackle some of the most complex and divise issues of today, such as climate change and the forever wars being waged in other areas of the world. We must broaden our perspective from the narrow (what we want; what we think we deserve) to the all in order to make any meaningful progress on these problems. And if we can do that, we may be able to find happiness in striving to heal the wounds of the world.

     People are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others, because this happiness does not depend upon aquiring things, having wealth or achieving all of your personal goals. It only depends upon our focus and our actions.
