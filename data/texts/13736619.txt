"Money makes the world go round"-Jake Kender. Money is used for so many things and just a simple peice of paper contains a status. Materialism can be used from people that have so much money they don't know what to do with it to people that never had money so they apprieciate gifts because its a simble of love. Materialism isn't just for girls that want the newest clothes and things it can also be for the people that live pay check to pay check and getting those little gifts mean the world. 

I, personally, am pro-materialism. Me and my fiance never had a lot growing up, my parents divorced living paycheck to paycheck to my fiances mom never being there because she had to keepworking to keep the lights on. So for me I had enough to get by and be a happy kid. For my fiance he had to put his life aside to take care of his 5 younger siblings. So I love seeing the smile on my fiances face when I have a tiny gift and he loves getting these little gifts of attention because he never recieved it before. 

That is why I dont think materialism isnt as bad as everyone tries to make it seem. It would just be what somepeople like to recieve and some people like to give. Then there's some people that hate little gifts like it's a burden. To each their own.
