Everyone wants to be truly happy and satisfied. The fundamental question is how do we go about actually achieving that? There are many who beileve that focusing on pursuing their own personal goals will lead to a sense of achievement and ultimately happiness, but this kind of happiness can be fleeting and lead to a sense of loneliness. What then will provide us with lasting happiness or satisfaction that does not fade?

When we focus on the happiness of others we find true contentment. This advice has been around for thousands of years and comes from a source that has the authority to instruct us as humans. Our creator Jehovah God states in his word the Bible "There is more happiness in giving than in recieving."- Acts 20:35. Further the greatest man whoever lived, Jesus Christ, instructed his followers to put others ahead of themselves to recieve blessings. When we display the type of love that God and his son Jesus recommend we can experience the type of happiness that does not fade. Putting others ahead of ourselves improves all the relationships in our lives, starting in our own families. If all in the world displayed this type of love and concern for others the world would definitely be a different place.

However, some say that we need to look inside of ourselves or push ourselves to accomplish more in order to find true contentment. This advice though can lead to our becoming selfish and only looking out for our own interests. We do not want to only look inwardly or isolate ourselves. True and lasting contentment comes from the relationships that we forge with others. Having good relationships with others provide us with lasting happiness that cannot be measured by how much money we have or by our our social status or our wealth. This type of happiness is truly worth pursuing and will draw others to us and us closer to God.
