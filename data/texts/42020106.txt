     There are many tatics that are used by businesses that have an effect on people to go in stores and have them buy what they store and the business wants you to buy and wants to steer you away from buying. The question here today is do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? My answer to this is yes and I have some information and experence to back up my statement.
     My ansewer to the promt question is yes because that is what the businesses that we walk into are supposed to do. If  we always just walked into establishments and only buy what we came for, businesses would have a hard time keeping consumers coming in. So why not have the people come in for the things that they need, but also have products that catch the eye and make you want to have it. Small items such as water bottles with bright viberant colors to catch your eye as you are walking down the isle you went into to grab someting else. Usually the product is never as good as the package that it is in. They will usually spend enough money on packaging to literaly just invite you to look at and once it is in your hand there is a high probablity that you will buy it. The thought of having nice colorful packaging distracts the buyer from the fact that they have no idea how the product in that package is. It could be gold plated poo.
     Thus, images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. In reality though, there is nothing that we can really do about it because they are using one of the human senses that we use daily and it quite necessary. This is one of those business tatics that just work and will contiue to work because of just the human senses.
