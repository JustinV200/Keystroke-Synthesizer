Have you ever fallen for the allure of an advertisement, only to find yourself living in a mundane reality without the dream you had been sold? Did you ever meet one of your heroes to see how human they actually were, as opposed to the giant you had built in your mind? Have you ever tried a meal because it looked delicious on the package, only to find out how vomit inducing it looks when you open that package up?

This is the power of advertising and marketing. Highly qualified individuals can take even the most bland things and sell you a fantasy. Politicians do this. Food companies do this and so do the ads you see on your television. It's about making you feel as though an image is attainable if you just buy a perfume, make up, vacation or do something that they want. Don't believe me? Did you know that food commercials regularly use fake food, paint and other completely inedible materials because it is more attractive than the actual product? Did you know that beautiful model has been doctored and edited using sophisticated software to hide all of their imperfections, and it sets and unattainable image for you to chase? 

The dream doesn't exist, not for you anyway, but it doesn't have to because the point is make money. Making you think happiness is only a purchase, product, or vote away from reality, but reality is not that malleable. It's time to realize you are being sold a lie. Good food and health take effort. Politicians are selling themselves to get a paycheck. Money can not and will never be able to buy happiness. It can helps satiate needs, but it will never be enough to penetrate that wall of fiction created in advertising.
