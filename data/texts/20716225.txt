different peoples have their different life goals. like some one want to be a doctor, some one want to be a engineer,for their life goals they face lots of challenges. after completing their dream they are very happy in that case.

some people wanted to help other people, basically who are needy and poor. By the helping other people  there is a another level of satisfaction feel in the mind. some people doing their best to helping others, like they donate food to the poor people, they donate their cloth to the poor people in the cold.It is very nobel work, and also very satisfing work too.
