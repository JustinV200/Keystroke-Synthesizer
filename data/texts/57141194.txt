Images and impressions do have a lot of effect on people. They want to have the best things in life. People see things on tv, ads and just people walking down the street and they think man i need that. They want to be better then the other guy. That might be to have a better home,more money or a better job. It build in the us human us  better then the other person. It human nuture to compete with our follow man. If that is to atrack a mate or just to be top dog.  
We live in a world that is run by companys.they have advertisements that can make us think they  way they want us to think . They can market in any  way they want to. they have to much controll over your life.
Tv ,internet and phone should be use with care. you should do anything else then be on your phone , internet or tv. so you dont get impressions about things that company want you to think. It good to think for yourself then what a company want you to think.
