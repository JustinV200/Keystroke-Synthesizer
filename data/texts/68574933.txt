Materialism is the process of acquiring and spending of money and possessions. Is materialism a good thing or a bad thing? that is what I am going o discuss in this paper. Who does not love a good life? who doesnt like to own and acquire good things in this life? definately not me, I love a good life, I love to get all the good things money can afford me. Life has become quite competetive, people are fighting for limited resources, therefoe it is understandable that everybody wants to acquire stuff for themselves. 
I do think it is unfair to criticize society or people for being too materialistic, people should be left to enjoy what they earn as long as they get it through fair means, as long as nobody is hurt in the process acquiring your possessions, you should be left to enjoy. 
Possessions and material things make life easy and comfortable, it affords one a life of luxury and ensures wellbeing of people, therefore it is a good thing by all means. I thus support the idea of materialism as long as one uses fair means to acquire and posses their wealth.
People who criticize materialism have a right to do so because people have been known to use great and unfair means to get their material possesions, others have gone to an extent of killing and hurting others to take what belongs to others. That is not how it should be.
