Is money really the root of all evil ? Is it bad to have things ? Is it wrong to want not only things, but new and better things? Welcome to my thoughts on this topic. Let me state my firm belief that modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. 

Gone are the days when the humility of meager apparel and soft-spokenness won the hearts and minds of the general public. In this day and age where traditional standards are questioned and challenged constantly, one has to stand shoulder to shoulder with one's peers and command attention. To the point of being heard, and then perhaps make a benevolent difference and affect change in the world around us. If not to affect change, to at the very least be heard and find those that share similar ideas and values.  

Consider any famous social icon or celebrity that indulges in fashion and lives a luxurious life. Regular people watch them closely and emulate their standards in their own lives. If they weren't so iconic, no one would be interested in their lives. Who did what to who ? Who built what, how and where ? Who slapped who on what internationally televised award show ? These are things that move us, that inspire us, that lead us to further develop our own humdrum lives. And what brought these figures to our screens ? What caused us to sit up and notice ? I would argue, it is materialism.  

Naturally, as working class citizens of the world, we understand that the pursuit of materialism is not the most nobel objective. No one likes a pompous person that flaunts their wealth with no seemingly moral purpose. Rather its use as a tool to be noticed, to stand out amongst the crowd, to possibly gain followers on social media, and to hopefully be a model for society. Positive or negative - that is completely up to the individual, and certainly a discussion for another day.
