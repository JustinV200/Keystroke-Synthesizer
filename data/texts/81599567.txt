Both competition and cooperation are usually required to achieve success. Competition drives us to achieve against something scarce, while cooperation allows divisions of labors that allows building things bigger than ourselves. Thus both are necessary. But both achieve within their respective environments.

The latin etymology of the word compete is usually stated as "come together" or "strive together". While competing it is usually necessary to have others involved to compete against. However it is the inherent desire to strive to do or be better than competitors that motivates us to achieve. To push ourselves to do or be better than we would normally without competition has the result of creating greater and better manifestations, whether it be performance or objects. This is seen in every Olympics in the individual events. Only through competition is such manifestations achieved.

However those manifestations are not necessarily the best on their own. When a person strives to achieve through cooperation, while not necessarily equalling the potential individual achievement, the cooperation may have a larger end result. The accumulation and amalgamation of the individual efforts, if coordinated and managed properly, can achieve greater things than an individual can. One person could not send a man to the moon.

Many will argue that competion or cooperation are the best. But both are necessary to maximize in their respective environments. Both can be used for the greater goods.
