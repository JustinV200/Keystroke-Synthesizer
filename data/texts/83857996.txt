We mortals seem to be always in search of happiness since we were born and the feeling of happiness becomes the most valuable feeling for the human being. The feeling of achievement, love, money for most people is a powerful feeling that for some can fill the emptiness and sadness within us.

But there are some people who already have enough money and have already achieved everything that an ordinary person can achieve and for psychology reasons they start to feel sad and empty and no matter what they do or buy the feeling of happiness seems farther and farther away from those people. The reason is that people who act like that don't care about others and think they are more important than anyone else, but the truth is they have to grow inside first and learn to help others and that's called philanthropy and it is the strong desire to promote the well-being of other people. Philanthropy is a way that people can find happiness just by helping humanity and providing help and relief to people in need or people living in poverty.

I would really find happiness if philanthropy became commonplace in the world we live in, because having the philanthropy philosophy can make us live in a better world for everyone.
