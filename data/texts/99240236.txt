People tends to be happy in any form. Some prefer their own happiness whereas few prefer others happinesss over theirs. Ultimately , if the people are happy, the society will be happy.Happiness can be achieved through goal, following ones dreams, focusing on the fellowmen's happiness and on the improvement of the society. It solely depends on individuals thoughts.
According to me, If a person is working hard towards a dream to make it true, one day he will achieve his goals. In this  process, he will have a fulfilment in his efforts which provides a happiness. This happiness will spread to his family and friends, which in turns improves his society. One must be consious about the society's need. Personal develepment alone cannot fulfil ones life. Concern about our society and its improvement is an important responsibility of every individual. So all of us has to open up towards the improvement of the society which is a great act of humanity. The happiness ones finds with the improvement of personal growth, family and friends growth is equally a bliss with that one can find in the society or others improvement. One must look the world as his home so that happiness can be achieved in all the aspects of life.
