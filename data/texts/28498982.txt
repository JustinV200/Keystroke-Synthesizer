Happiness

Happiness is the solution that we all are looking for. If maybe a god showed up and gives  us a wish, we would simply ask him to give us happiness because is it is all we want. In this life we spent least amount of time with happiness because all the time we face a problem, does'nt mater whether it is small or big problem is problem. It collapse or destroy our happiness.

Happiness is everywhere, if we help someone he would be happy like we gave him that and not only that it brings us happiness too, because we know we made someone happy. If we focus on our own dream, we would achieve it one day and it is going to make us very happy ofcourse. But if we try to help others and made them happy, it make us feels like devine and one day may be they help us to achieve our dream too and over all we will achieve it. So be thankful to who helped you in the past and try to help them back, it is going to make him happy and also you.

Happiness is all we need. Problems come and go but friends who brings us happiness is like god to us so don't leave them don't forget them. And together laugh as hard as you can. Then find a girl who can give you happiness and try to give happiness back. Live long till you get enough happiness.

Spread love.........Peace.
