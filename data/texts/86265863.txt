In the real world competition is everything. it is what drive us as humans to excel, the satisfaction derive from this can not be over emphasised compared to cooperation.
The idea of competition is one of our basic instinct as human, it is what put as the apex predator in the bio-system of life ove other animals. Competition compared to cooperation is a forging tool that brings out only the best, animals have packs as a sort of cooperation among them but these are nothing in the face of a single inividual fighting for the chance to live, survive and dominate among its peer, in every pack there must be a leader and this is not choosen by cooperation among the packs but by competing with one another showing how organisms with less intelligence to humans values competition.
Moreso, Competition is everywhere in our modern world, even though sometimes it fosters hostility, hatred and greed among individuals but the importance of it above cooperation can not be neglected, cooperations tends to dissolve self-confidence, leading to over-reliant on others to accomplish tasks. We must remenber that Capitalism, the fundamental of our American Economy is built upon a foundation of competition, capitalists confirms competitions encourages companies to improve constantly, progressing faster in order to excel above others in the same market thereby leading to a better society.
Finally, having a constant competitor in one's life can encourage one to reach its full potential and even break past one's limit. Through competition progress and growth never stops, the desire and zeal to excel peers is unending, thereby flourishing the morale and tenacity to keep forging ahead to create more and better achievements and success. 
I can therefore with confidence and conviction say we as human tends to bring out our best under pressure and achieve more success through Competition rather than Cooperation!.
