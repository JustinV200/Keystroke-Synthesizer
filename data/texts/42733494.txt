competition helps people to acheive success more easily than cooperation does, competition helps people to make easily than co operation competition helps people to make an effort while cooperation lets people just dawdle around. success isn't easy to achieve, so competition helps to make a person to waste time fooling around and not get work done , especially if he/she is work done and use some effort while comprtition lets people give it their all. competition lets people give it their  competition helps achieve success more than cooperation does. cooperation could be helpful  and satisfactory ,

 but without competition ,it makes the actual goal itself. so that one person forget where are he/she is wanting to get , which in this case is success so that  one person can be the more than cooperation and collaboration does .success is achieved differently , competition helps people to achieve success more than cooperation does.so competition helps people to make an effort while cooperation lets people to make than competition better.
