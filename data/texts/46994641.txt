Some may say that appearances can have too much of an effect on people and how they perceive what really isn't there. For example, a beautiful woman may look pleasingly, but inside, she may be a person who is a bully and likes to consider herself better than others. Her beauty may make one forget how nasty a person she is. Her demeanor speaks volumes about what kind of person she really is. 

Another example is a person's charisma and how they play it to get what they want. For example: Donald Trump. Sure, he exudes money, charisma, charm and wealth, but in fact, is a person who can use this to turn people into things they would not normally be. He is a terrible businessman, terrible person and terrible human being. When he was president, he made several comments about groping women, saying that the coronavirus was a "Chinese virus" and basically allowed the Capitol of the United States to be usurped because he told everyone that he won the presidency and not Joe Biden. He loves to incite violence and pretend like he never said or do anything that lit a fire in some unhinged person's brain. He used his charm to sway people into being okay with what he was doing. 

The last example is a Christmas present. They can be wrapped beautifully and decorated with bows and ribbons but inside, lay Grandma's 10 year old fruitcake. No one wants it, but one may feel obligated to give it. Giving Grandma's unwanted gift is akin to getting unwanted advice from celebrities and politicians who do not know you or care about your every day life. And yet, some people feel like they are obligated to follow every piece of word to the last crumb whether or not it will do any good. 

If celebrities and politicians would be honest about what they represent, we would be able to see and make a decision on whether or not we like what we see. Appearances are most definitely deceiving and people aren't always what they seem.
