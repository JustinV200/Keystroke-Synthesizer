How many times have you been talking to someone and something catches your eye, and for a moment, you lose concentration on what another person is saying? How many times have you picked out a book from the bookstore based solely on how interesting and colorful the cover is before even reading a summary to see what it is about. The world is full of examples of the effect that split-second images can have on people, whether it comes to packaging, products, or even people. Our brains are hard-wired to first look at surface-level characteristics and make judgments based upon them. 
Far too many times than I would care to admit, my child has purchased a toy based on the colorful and fun packaging, and then a week later, that toy has gone the way of so many toys before-to the dreaded drawer that never gets opened to be played with again. However, as much as I would like to chalk this up to a childish, easily-influenced behavior, I am often guilty of the same impulses. I've purchased many products in boxes with shiny packaging and promises of making my life easier. Even more worrisome is my ability to judge other people based on my initial impression and judgments of their appearances. I have almost lost out on many a friend because their 'packaging' wasn't shiny enough for me.
It is true that our brains are prone to make initial impressions. Whether that is right or wrong is not for me to decide. It cerrtainly can help us make judgments tat could affect our safety and well-being, but like anything, it can also be to our detriment if we don't allow ourselves to look past first appearances and see the potential good inside.
