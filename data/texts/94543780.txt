Images and impressions often do have an effect on people. We are living in a world where perception of outer appearences give out the impression of what something or someone may be that's left to the interpretation of the perceiver. These images and impressions can be anything such as advertisements, products, celebrities, buildings, and artwork. Although these images and impressions are presented in a certain way to make the perceiver feel or react in a specific way, they may not be what they seem to be when digging deeper into them. 

A great example of this can easily be found in the celebrities that we admire. On the outside, they may seem to live a glamorous and happy lifestyle from what is shown to us on TV or newspapers, but it's more often than not that these celebrities have a darker reality. For instance, with the family friendly actor and comedian Bill Cosby, he was a beacon of friendiless, happiness, and upstanding morals when perceived through his work throughout his career. However, the crimes that he has committed are completely the opposite of the impression he was letting off to the public. 

In this day and age where media is consumed in massive amounts through TV, social media, forums, and images where reality is often warped, it can be difficult to tell what something or someone truly is apart from what they show us. In some cases, we may have this effect on ourselves as well by perceiving ourselves to be more capable than not.
