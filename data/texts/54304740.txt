yes, obvioulsy images and impressions have too much effect on people. most of the time people are diverted by someone elses impressions on them or mostly what they see with their own eyes. people tend to believe what they see or whatever is presented to them very neatly. when a products advertisment  is very approachable people tend to buy those product very much or more frequently.  there are many successful company where their advertisments made them more money than anything else. the better they can advertise the better their selling is. so this is why i can say is images have too much effect on people.

there's a saying that first impressions matters the most. the better one person can make an impression on the other the better the relation gets. for example, politicians always tries to make a better impressions on the local people so that people vote them more than other candidates. public figures does that too. they only show their better impressions to others and this is why people give them so much attention. so this proves impressions have too much effect on people.

so in all we can say that people are definitly diverted by images and impressions on them. for example whichever companys are better in advertising the better thier selling is, advertising is all that matters, even when the content do not match with the packaging people buy those products. even for me whichever person makes a good impression on my i will trust them more than those who didnt. so by this i can prove that people definitly have too much of an effect of images and impressions.
