     Happiness is something that most human beings strive to achive in life.  Some people spend their lives in search of what makes them happy, and some seem to find it early and often.  Is there a definitive path to happiness?  This essay will attempt to determine if focusing on one's personal goals will lead to happiness, or if focusing on the happiness of others is the way to happiness.
     Achieving a goal can certainly make one happy.  Achieving a goal after putting in so much hard work and effort is definitely a rush, but will it lead to lasting happiness?  Human beings are wired to keep setting goals and trying to achieve them, so is there ever a point where one is happy with what they have achieved?  It seems that the goalposts for this kind of happiness are constantly moved, and may put us in a constant state of struggle rather than happiness.
     Focusing on making others happy can also make us happy.  Seeing someone else being happy, especially when you helped facilitate that happiness, can be very rewarding.  It doesn't take much to make others happy.  One would not have to sacrifice much to say a kind word, share a meal, or be a listening ear for a friend.  A person could also donate to charities or give of themselves as volunteers, and be a crucial component of the happiness of people he doesn't even know.
     There is more than one path to happiness.  The path that one takes is a personal choice, but it seems that focusing on the happiness of others may breed more happiness and good will in the long run, rather than focusing solely on personal goals.  Personal goals are important, but facilitating happiness in others is the most rewarding use of your time in life.
