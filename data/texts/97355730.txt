What is Happiness? What defines the meaning of this word? That is not a easilly answered question. For some, happiness is taking care of those around them. By doing a variety of things from running errands, cleaning and taking care of children or elderly reletives. For others, happiness is being career driven and spending the days and nights working on a project, to see it through. Building a career from the ground up and watching as it grows. To one day be able to hand the keys to the business down to another generation. Some also find their most happiness helping others. This could included persuing a career that allows you to do this, such as a doctor, a nurse , a police officer or even a firefighter to name a few options. These individuals spend their lives trying to make the lives of others better, fore this is how they find their happiness.

 So, what is my point , you may ask. My point is that, there is no ONE way or key to happiness. Happiness can and is found in a variety of places. Different for so many depending of their outlooks on life. This is all part of the dream, to be able to pursue our own ideas of happiness, freely without judgement. This is why we should work together to help in each others journies to find happiness. 

Find what makes you happy and pursue those dreams, till you reach your goals.
