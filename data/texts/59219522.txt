every thing is marketing in these days.....every product and the manufacturer is focused on their marketing and sales only.....they doesn't reveal the original contents they used on the product....they should use some marketing techologies like advertisement in television and internet, colourful packages and etc......for some products some celebrity persons promote the products without the full knowledge about the product.....and most peoples trust the celebrity and government so they purchase the product and use it....

but politicians and government should take proper actions to the companies like  unsafe or unfollow the certain rules.....because most of the time we know about the product after some years only even with the information of food and safety control department.....but we already used the products....many children and old age peoples are affected by this with out our knowledge.....

prevention is better than cure....so every people must know about their health preference......and know the politics around them....we can't trust the advertisement or company or government blindly......we only take the prevention actions and knowledge about the products that contains what ingrediants.....in this marketing world we are just business to the most of the companies and they mostly focused on profit only.....so we can only protect us with the knowledge of what is really happening.....
