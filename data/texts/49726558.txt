Happiness is a desire that every person strives for. Whether their happiness is rooted in receiving money, love, experience, or simply peace. The goals that people set for themselves are rooted in acheiving their own happiness. For example, earning more money allows for someone to live a life they have strived for and in turn they gain happiness from acheiving their goal. Thus, people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals.

The journey of acheiving said goals can be brutal and gruesome. Every journey that one embarks on is full of valleys and hills, but the journey is part of why the happiness is so satisfying. If one does not experience struggle or unhappy moments, then one can not understand the true happiness that exists. Emotions like happiness require the understanding of the opposite emotions as well. In this case, sadness, frustration and or depression. These negative emotions are some that come along with the process of achieving happiness through accomplishing a personal goal.

While focusing on other peoples' happiness can bring happiness, the satisfaction that comes from this action does not produce the same level of satisfaction. The gratification will produce happiness, but not to the same extent that personal gratification will. Focusing on personal goals produces more happiness and thus is more likely to produce a longer more satifying happiness. Unfortunately, the reality of this conclusion is that even though achieving personal goals makes one happy, the cycle of going along a journey to experience the final outcome of happiness is only temporary and there will always be a new goal to set in order to achieve the next set of temporary happiness.
