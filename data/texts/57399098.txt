Happiness is surely because of our own inner things not about others
if we focus on our own goals, then we can acheive our goal that is the biggest acheivement and biggest happiness in our life. 

In my point of view happiness of others is not at all our own happiness, if we like to help others means its our wish, because of our own wish we are helping to others. That is also for our own hapiness only.

We may set our goal to help others, like helping for poor people and collecting fund for trust are all by our own interest for our inner satisfaction. That kind of happiness also our own happiness. 

In our life there are short term and long term goal. Theres are many goals. If we achieve one by one that is the sucess of our life. our goals shoul be acheived by not hurting others and it should be done in a correct way. 

If we make others happy that is also for our own inner happiness not for the others sake. it depends upon our character. My personal goal is to acheive something bigger and to help others. I will be more likely to be happy by focusing on my personal goals.  

So I focus on my goals means that is my biggest happiness. If we live for others happiness means then we have to sacrifice many things in our life for others. All people cannot get a chance to fulfill our dreams. Our goal can also set by ourself, we can set our goal to acheive our dreams. For that we have to put hardwork. That is the success and that is the happiness.
