The goal of society is to sell the consumer something at any cost.

This can be seen by watching commercials.  You see a commercial for a fast food restaurant and the food looks delicious.  You get in your car and drive to the restaurant to eat the food you just saw on the television.  You get your food and take a bite and realize that it is not as good as you thought it would be.  The commercial made it look better than it actually is.

You see politicians promise many things when they are on the campaign trail.  In reality, once they are elected they actually get very little done for the people that they represent.  People vote for candidates that look the part not necessarily the best politician.

People love entertainers who are beautiful and fit.  They don't really care how well they entertain or act as long as they look beautiful while out in public.  If they go out and look like a real person, the media takes photos and plaster those all over the internet saying look how they really look.  Judge people by how they act not how they look.

Society would be much better if we didn't place so much emphasis on how things look.  We would be better off if we made decisions based on what is best for us or our family.   Our abilities should be judged on how well we represent ourselves, not by how we look or what we say.  Actions are much better than words.  Judge people by how they act when no one is looking not how they act when everyone is looking.
