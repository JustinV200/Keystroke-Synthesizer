Americans are way too materialistic nowadays.  

I can personally remember a time in my younger years when I only wanted to own designer clothes and bags and I thought I was cool when I showed off my goods to other people.  Now, I could care less what I wear or what kind of purse I carry.  It's just not important to me now that I am older.

It's more important to me that I use my money on experiences instead of things - like going to places I have never been to when I go on vacations.  There are so many things to do and see in the United States - you just have to get out there and see them!  These experiences stay with you forever and you can relive them over and over again when you look back at Facebook and see all of the photos you have posted on your time line.  

People shouldn't be criticized for wanting things - that's just the way we are and I think it's just part of our nature.  We tend to want what other people have so we can be like them, have them like us and fit in.  However, not everyone has to be like that.  

There are some people who choose to live simply and not spend their money on unnecessary things and I really admire them for doing that.  These individuals might live off the grid or travel the world in a conversion  van or in a camper.  If only I were younger, I would jump on the chance to leave everything behind and see the country.  

Right now, I am trying hard to downsize all of my possessions so I can save up for a world cruise one day.  It's hard because I love things and I have collected so many things over the years.  I don't want to part with anything but I really don't even look at over half of the stuff I own.  Less is better and it is time to start having less at this point in my life.
