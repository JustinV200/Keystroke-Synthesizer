If a person is happy, they tend to radiate happiness to other people, so it is very important to get personall happiness. Personally, I find it imortant when other people are happy. It is very fulfilling to see other people happy thus making me happy. This means that working towards making my friends and family happy makes me happy in return. I make it my personal goal to see others happy . I do this by  taking part in projects that help serve other people and give the little I have to the less fortunate. This my be a small deed but causes a big impact on the lives of other people. It puts a smile on their faces, making me happy in return.
Other people find happiness in having a goa, working towards it and achieving it. That is why people are happiest when they achieve a life they dreamt of like having a certain type of car, having a big house and such.
When all is done and said, everybody should be free to search and follow what makes them happiest. That will improve the quality of life in general making ours a happy world to live in.
