I belive that the correct awnser to the question posed in this promp is that, as with all great philisophical questions, it depends on the person that we are talking about. Some people find it easy to be happy while focusing on their own personal goals while others find it easier to focus on the emotional needs of other people. After all, having met many a people in my life time I can atest to the fact that no two people are alike in this regard. 

For some people, such as my self, the focus on compleation and compleation of their own personal goals is the key to them being happy. It gives people such as my self great pleasure to know that we have done a hard days work to further a goal that we have in mind. This does not mean that we do not think of how other people feel nor care about them, but rather that we internalize our feelings. These people may get a lot of work done or simply perfer being alone.

On the other hand, some people find it easier to find happiness by helping to make others happy and futher other people's goals. My girlfirend is one such person who does this. You will often find her at my side, helping me do what ever task I happen to be doing at that time and asking how I, and others around me feel. These kinds of people love being in the company of others.

In my opinion both kinds of people are needed in this world for it could not function with out both of them. People who focus on them selves need people to focus on them. I believe that this world would be an extreamly sad place with out both kinds of people.
