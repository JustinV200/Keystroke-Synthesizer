I believe that people are more likely to experience happiness when they connect with others. When it comes time for us to leave this world, and our past comes back in vivid detail, we'll remember the people and places, and not the things. Those memories will mean more when shared with others. In this essay the way I see happiness is less smiles and laughter, and more about being at peace with one's self and others.

When we laugh, cry, or smile with others we grow closer with them because we are comfortable. And that I believe is what happiness truly is--simply existing with another person, and being at peace with one's self at the same time. Sure the donut tastes good in the moment, but unless that was a million dollar donut, chances are we won't remember that donut. So as I see it, when two people can share a space and remain comfortable, whether they are laughing, smiling, or crying, they are happy with one another. And that in my opinion is far more important than any ole million dollar donut.

While taking the time to point out what we'll think about on our death bed might be somewhat morbid or callus, I believe it's an important perspective to maintain as we grow older. Because that's the insight that will lead to true happiness and contentment throughout our lives. And we'll be most happy when making sure that others are comfortable enough to smile, cry, and laugh around us, and that they we are free to express those emotions around those we care about as well. Because like it or not, our happiness is continuouslly interlinked with the happiness of others. From depending on the tallest individuals to look over the savannah grass for mega fauna predators, to creating Vblogs at the cafe, we would be using the same flint rock tools for 300,000 years like our old friends Home Erectus, had it not been for our ability to connect, share ideas, and become comfortable among others.
