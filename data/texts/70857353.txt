Being materialistic doesnt mean one is happy, how many times do people buy  fancy clothes and are not happy?Therefore there is a reason why we should criticize materialism.

One it is believed that when one has materialistic things he or she is happy while deeply inside, the person is not happy at all which means there is more than what we think happines is.Love is not materialistic but when one is in love or has love they tend to be peaceful and brings fulfilment but the desire  for materialistic things leads to an endless appeal.Wealthy people who have made in in life devote themselfs in giving out to charity and making someone smile.

Second great families,friends,relatives falls apart due to materialistic things.Is it worth it to lose people who were once your family due to acquiring posseion and spending more  to deprive people of their sense of love and care and other endless beautiful emotion.People are happier without being materialsitic.But nowdays people sacrifice everything including family and friends inorder to earn money and be wealthy.

In summation the only problem that we have is that we tend to think that when we have the materials we are happy but not forgeting that it leads us to forget and become unware of the wonderful things we have on hand like love,care, peace and unity.
