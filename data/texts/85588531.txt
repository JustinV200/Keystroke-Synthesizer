       How would you say you gain your happiness? Is it from achieving the goals you've set for yourself? Or is it seeing others laugh and smile in their versions of happiness? I believe that you have to be happy within yourself to honestly and truly be happy for you own accomplishments, as well as being truly joyful for others happiness.
 
      Happiness and joy generally comes from deep inside your own being. Everyone has the power within themselves to make the slightest changes in their environment and surroundings to help set their path on a course for a happier life. Just think, if you are always negative, think negatively about yourself, and always criticizing even your greatest accomplishments, much less, the smallest of accomplishments, how can you truly be happy for others and their feats? You have to learn to control the negativity within yourself and approach each day with positivity and optimism. Don't supress it or forget about it, that will only make you feel unhappier, and will be harder for you to get control of your happiness back. Ask yourself, if someone you loved was feeling this way, what type of advice would you give them? Then apply that advice to yourself

      If you can learn to do this, in no time, you will learn how to wake up each day with a smile on your face, embrace your own happiness, be truly happy for others. So, in order for you to be truly happy for others, you have to deep down be positive and truly happy for yourself.  Thinking positive thoughts, surrounding yourself with positive people and surroundings, helps you overcome the negativity in your life.
