Keeping up with the Jones's has increased in meaning over time. Whether it's having a nicer home, a faster car, or a variety of outdoor toys, showing one's money has always been an indicator of success. But when it enough enough? At what point does treating oneself to new items become materialistic? 

Money allows us the enjoyment of products, services, and experiences. Without this green piece of paper, we cannot fulfill our basic or advanced needs. The average person spends most of their lives working just to collect this money. With that in mind, splurging on toys or desires is hardly unreasonable. Life is short and you can't take the money with you to the grave, so splurging a little is a part of life and enjoying that life. 

On the contrary, spending money one does not have is never wise. Living a life of debt is not worth being able to show off a new car. People would benefit greatly from accepting what they have and being happy with what they have. As money comes, so can new toys, ventures, and experiences. Until then, I would suggest saving and spending wisely.

There is no one answer to what makes someone materialistic, but keeping everything in moderation is always the best way to live. Once we realize the Jones's credit card bill may be more than we're willing to accept, only then we can live our best lives!




Having a 30 minute mandatory time is insane! I'm just sitting here with my computer open so I can count down the time - I'm done writing my essay. And then I get a "inactive for 2 minute" warning? Lame! You took what was an enjoyable survey and turned it into an obligation. Maybe the next prompt should be: Why do we limit freedom so much these days? Or better yet: Why do Americans allow insignificant things to waste their time?
