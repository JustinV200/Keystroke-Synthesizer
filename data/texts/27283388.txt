Electronics, cars, houses, boats, recreation vehicles; should we as a modern society be criticized for being materialistic?  Who gets to decide when stuff is too much stuff?  Should people work hard and never have anything for themselves?  People have worked hard for years and have bought things they need and things they want.

Modern society should not be criticzed for being materialistic.  Most people work hard and shoul have some things for enjoyment.  The key is to have stuff and not let stuff have you.  There has to be a balance between stuff and your priorities in life.  There is nothing wrong with being materialistic.  People should be able to enjoy some of their hard earned money without feeling guilty about it.  

Usually people that complain about others being materialistic are jealous of what others have.  Everyone has the same opportunity to work hard to earn money to buy materialistic items.  People try to say that everyone should be equal.  We are all equal.  We all have the ability to work and earn money to buy things.  We all have skills to earn money.  Unfortunately, alot of people try to live above their means.  We need to budget and make sure our needs are taken care of first.

People should be allowed to choose to spend their money on materialistic items without fear of being criticized.  We should be good stewards of our money and make sure our bills are paid.  We should have some money put back for emergencies.  We should also be able to buy materialistic items without criticism.  No one should be able to tell us when we have too much stuff.  Everyone has varying opinions.  There is no hard rule on when too much stuff is too much stuff.  Everyone needs to worry about taking care of themselves and their familes, and leave everyone else alone.
