In my point of view happiness are ery much associated with we focus on our own goals ,if we focus on others goal we are loss our happiness. So happiness arevery much based on our own goals. So happiness are very much happen with our own goals and success.

So in our life if we need succes on our goal not others so success are very much based upon our happiness. In some deals the people happiness is based the personal goals to achieve. I made a happness of my own feeeling by driving in my own vehicle. I am a middle class family  to achieve to buy a car by owning by setting goal to buy my own machine and to drive. 

After a lot of disappointments of my driving feelings by asking my friends and relatives. Afterthat I focus to my working for earnings to acheive my dream to buy a car and to drive. I felt disappoint by not accepting my disire to driving a car. 

I worked together with my spouse to acheive my dream of my own car buying. We are both worked for a while very much eagerly to acheive my own happiness of buying a dream car like big deals. In my point people only having focused only to their own happiness. There is no necessery to focus on others acheivement and happiness. It is only based on the only thing is what others will do for us. It is not neccesary to focus on others happiness if they not helpfull for us. I focused only my happiness and not to others. I do favours for others by how they treating me.
