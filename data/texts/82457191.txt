I would say no, because the human nature is quite evolution aspect, the world has new set of human evolved around fifty years of age according to the world human organisation, the most perfect adapting species in the world is human, which not according to physical aspect even throught emotional aspect.

The few aspect of modernlife have been more criticized than most of the philospher i would say most of the people who does not expect most evolve of human nature, that the reason most of the pholospher critize evolve of the human, the main aspect of evolve human nature is acquiring possession of property, money, foods, and speding money on luxury factors thats too, is a vital source of menaing and happiness of our current evolved human nature, you can sustain this world without sustaing and adaption human nature to other human techonolgies.

You must keep tyou mind adapting accordin to modern technolgies for example television, smartphone, especially you need to adapt in futre twenty eeyars to ai technoliges, i would ai is the future techonliges of the world, in the futre man would not use smartphone itself, only robot with advanced ai tehcnoliges, at last answer to the question, i wouls say "MUST CRITICIZED".
