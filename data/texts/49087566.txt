Happiness can only be truly achieved when one is working for their own interests. It is essential that one focus on themselves in order to be happy.

People can certainly be happy when focusing on the hapiness of others, but if they neglect to do what they want to do in life, they will end up with regrets. I have seen many people devote their lives towards others while persuing their own goals, such as working for nonprofits or charity work. This is a healthy way to pursue both.

That being said, if one focuses solely on others, they will lose themselves as time goes on. I've seen this happenk to many mothers that focused on their kids entirely for their identity. Once the children grew up, they were left with nothing. Many of them entered into a long depression. Some of them found new purpose in their own goals. The ones that did not find a new way to focus on themselves became more obsessed with their children's achievements and seemed to live through their children, which aways struck me as massively unhealthy. 

In conclusion, it is absolutely fine to help others as long as you are also focing on yourself and your personal goals as well or else you will not find true happiness. You only get one live. It is important to do what you want to do with it.
