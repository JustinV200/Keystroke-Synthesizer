What is materialism ? Is it cut and dry, black and white, or is it relative to individuals, and the way we must live our lives in the soiceities we are in. What one person sees as a need the next may see as a luxury or just a thing to own. 
     Should we hold the mom down the street who has one child and one tiny dog accountable for owning a 12 person SUV with never more than 3 people present, taking up more than her fair share of the parking space, gas and clean air. Even though she fears less for her child and her own saftey in the larger vehicle and is always ready to help out on feild trips or friend trips to the mall. Who decides what is right for her and that she is being materialistic. 
     What about the guy who loves fishing but had to have a boat many times over bigger and faster than what he "needs" to catch his fish, or did he need that boat at all? What is wrong with the peir or shore side. Does he have another use for that boat, is it just about his pride?
     From the time we are all children we start collecting things - clothes, toys, momentos, homes, cars, bobbles and do-dads. Who decides  what  you needed and what I didn't. 
     I know I don't considermyself "materialistic" but what would someone from a third world country say about all the stuff I own, about the huge amount of time, large moving truck and multiple trips it took to move it all. 
     Should we be criticized - yes we should. Why, to keep our "needs" in check,they are bad for our enviroment, and our own mental health. They lead us to lose track of what is truly important, and criticim is only that - we still have to freedom to be a materialistic as we see fit.
