Today, we consume more products than our previous generations. It is not unusual for an average American to have multiple credit cards. The phrases like 'a retail therapy' and 'a shopping spree' are often used to describe a normal afternoon activity. It seems more and more likely that 'materialism' has become a norm that makes Americans happy. Is it about time something should be done about the materialistic society we live in?

Credit cards were introduced to the mainstream US society only a few decades ago. Before, consumers would carry cash, budget their spending, and could only buy things that they could afford. When the concept of credit purchase was introduced, it allowed buyers to borrow money to shop and pay later. For those who needed cash urgently, the credit purchase not only greatly helped them out but in some cases became their lifeline. But at what cost?

It also brought the materialistic side of consumers. People became more irresponsible in their purchasing habits and at the same time the retail and banking industries started capitalizing on people's such impulsive buying patterns. Today, it is not difficult to come across a case where people value more of materials than of organic and societal things like friendship, education, and family.

Young adults going in debts for expensive cars and decorations while neglecting their needs for education. Couples with kids going on luxurious vacations while their kids could use better care. We hear these unfortunate stories over and over. If only the society could teach the new generations that spending money is not everything and that it will not necessarily make them happy, we could start to learn about importance of responsibility
