I believe is very important to feel happy with your own life before share it with the oter people because if you are not happy with yourself, how you can feel happy with others.  I love hearing other people that  they are very satisfied with their live.  I am happy to know that other people are happy and that make me feel more happy.

Sometimes people think that they depend of the live of other to be happy but for me this is not true.  You have to be happy yourself and than you can be happy with eveybody.

I think the most important part is feel happy with yoursel.  You need to understand that eveybody have their own opinions and you can't try to push them to apply under your rules.  I feel good when I can share with different people from different cultures, that way they can learn from you and you can learn from them.

This world need more understanding people.  The world is full of different ideas that comes from different countries, with their culture, language, food.  I feel happy to have that chance to share my opinions with different people and also understand their opinions.

One day I will be sharing my opinions without feeling that fear that sometimes I feel because I know everybody has something special.
