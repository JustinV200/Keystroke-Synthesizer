Modern society is very materialistic.  This a fact, and we are shown this daily.  But is it a bad thing?  Is our society too materailistic?  Is this harmful to us, and to future generations?  Let's take a deeper look.

Our society, especially in America and Europe, is deeply materialistic.  We crave things, and we are taught at an early age that we should want more, we need more, and that this is a good thing.  We are taught to gauge our self worth on what we own.  We are passing this onto our children.  Everywhere we look; ads, movies, our peers; they tell us our value is gaged by what we posess.

Is this a bad thing?  Should we be criticized for our actions?

YES!  This is a terrible way to live.  MLK said that a man "should be judged by the content of his character"
nothing else.  Are you a better person in a fancy car and designer jeans?  I doubt it.  Am I a better person if my home looks like Martha Stewart's?  No.

This is not where the values of God and family lie.  They lie inside of people, not on the outside.  What we own is not who we are, and no matter what the media and my TV say, I refuse to believe otherwise.  We need to take a hard look at who we are as a soceiety, and the message we want to send to others.  Possessions do not make the man.  Values do.   

We should criticize ourselves for our overly materilistic views.  By taking a hard look at who we are and what we value; as a society, as  families, and as humans; then we can begin to change.  Hopefully, this change will be for the better, and we can grow to our full potential, and teach real values to our children.
