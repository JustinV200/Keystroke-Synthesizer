I feel our society is already critized for being materalistic due to our behaviors in social settings. Materialism can help an individual in a therapuetic way which applies to majority of society. We are even willing to use credit cards and loans to shop for items that could be a gift for family members, friends, co-workers, classmates, and gifts for ourselves. 

Materialism is applied in social settings such as shopping malls, shopping outlets, flea markets, department stores, and other settings. Materialism involves spending money and an individual could show apperciation or the worth of a person being in their lives by buying them a gift in return. For example, there is a white elephant exchange party at my job and I buy a gift at the minimum requirement and pick gender netural gifts to fit any one of my coworkers personality. It makes me feel good seeing the look on their faces. 

We as a society, tend to use materialism as form of giving but this comes with a cost for some individuals. Sometimes we are on a certain budget and this results in putting a hold on gift giving and going out with friends or family members. It would be helpful solution for me to create a small gift baskets for those around me would appericiate a more intimate gift that was personalized as well.
