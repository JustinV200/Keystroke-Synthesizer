In a way, both competition and cooperation are drivers of excellent success but while cooperation may enforce all participant to take a route toward their goals, competition on the other hand may produce diverse unique routes taken by participants toward their goals for reasons such as time factor, quality or the overall situation.

Competition and cooperation are both conditions to work. The former is in place when individuals or groups are vying for the benefit of a target goal against each other while the later exists among members of a group and they all have a common goal.

From my own perspective, I believe cooperation is better for a number of reasons:
First, it is an aggregation of people with unique ideas as the proverb says, two heads are better than one. For instance, say a team cooperation of 2 people vs an individual, the time it takes to plan or collate ideas might be shorter as spoken ideas are instantly developed further by the other participant in the team compared to a competitive scenario where while all the eventual thoughts may be same, longer time is spent in thought.
Secondly, in terms of resources, cooperation among participants can fill in loop holes e.g. a person can just be an investor, another could be the idea owner, while others could be the experts knowledgeable of executing the born idea.
Thirdly, cooperation gives participants the confidence to unitedly forge ahead which on the competitive side, participants might have unneccessary anxiety due to the uncertainty of they fare compared to others.

Thus, while competition and competition each have their pros and cons, cooperation tends to produce faster results from quality inputs of resources from financial to knowledge.
