Ideally,materialism is the consideration of precious and 'money ' like items more than our societal values.The modern world which in our layman language  is defined as the internet era   is more materialistic than our  old age which valued communism and cherished morals in a big way.A society full of  capitalism and that has a low opinion for socialism and value the material things of the world .Fact are clear  that the modern society is materialistic and it is evident  in the following number of ways;
The current society value money more that our morals.People mind their properties,money,land ,company shares more than they will value religion and moral values.Most nations are now cultivating the fabric morone of corruption .Most youths are unable to get jobs becouse those jobs are sold at very high prices.To win a tender or a contract in a company one has to buy the contract.Most hospitals have no drugs simply becouse the doctors steal this drug to sell them in their private hospitals to citizens.Politics are done based on the depth of the pockets of the contestants.Democracy is being traded with exchange for money.People value money and never morals anymore.More respect is awarded to someone rich than we value someone with character and morals.
However,this is just my standpoint and i am liberal and stand corrections .Onother school of tought may think otherwise but for sure we have to all admit that money is now rulling the world.We talk of our GDP and compare our level of per capita income by how  much we are endowed materially.
In conclusion,Morals have  no space anymore in our society but our mindsets are tuned toward materialism.We think money ,talk money ,worship money in our current society than it was in the past years.The world must change.We should not erode the values of the past in exchange the material future.There is life in good values than material things that finally grave our hopes and beutiful futures.
