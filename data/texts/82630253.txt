           Do you belileve in everything you see at first glance ? or do you take your time to reserch your product? Images and impressions have waaay too much effect on todays people. we see all these comercials on tv and social media telling us to buy all sorts of products and we jump ! perhaps they just look so pretty ,or the people who are promoting it are good looking, or even showing us how happy the  product makes them. .. we just take their word for it.
            I remember when I was just browsing social media and I came accross a nice pair of leggings the model was wearing .. she was promising I too can look like her if buy it.. I was so excited about it that I purchesed these leggings quickly with out even reserching the product , and let me tell you . I looked nothing like this model in them. haha. I went back on the website and looked in the comment section to find out that the leggings were not so great.  So it goes to show you that people should actually take the time and do some product reserch to see if indeed its something that is worth getting. It will save you time and money at the end.
             In conclusion, some might argue advertisments will not promote something to this extent if product wasent good. well let me tell you something yes they will . Its all about their  marketing  scheme ! to get consumers such as yourself and me to purchase products, so they can make their profit. Belive it or not , it happens quite often . Sometimes we fall into their trap, so  dont be fooled by pretty images and less information on the actual product.Remember why you want to buy and what  you will gain from it , you will do just fine if you keep this in mind .
