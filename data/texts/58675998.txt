we all are living in a much more competitive world than it was in the past the competition has greatly increased and made its way in every industry and localitis it is affecting more people who believe that competition is the only way to success but even in this world there are people who believe in co operative work and group success by this way the productivity is highly increased and made a lot of difference.

 i hope people begin to adopt the way of co operation over high competitive behaviour they must learn to work as teams to make the most out of their time they can make a lot of progress and get their works done with great efficiency to make the most out of it they need to adapt the way of co operative works to make their team work effective and to reach success without a lot of struggle.

this can also be said as as a single competitive person he can win fights against a small group of people but to win  a empire or kingdom they must work as a well organised army for the taste of victory. 
whne we win it is just out victory but when we win as a team the taste of victory hits different.
