Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. As a society, we are bombarded every year with new versions of products and shiny objects that attract many modern consumers.  Through social media, tv and print advertising, consumers have become more and more materialistic and the mania of materialism must be criticized. 


Materialism can cause unrepairable conflicts in relationships, marriages and family. Many marriages that are based on material possessions often end in divorce. For example, a woman may marry a man because she is attracted to a beautiful brand new corvette. A man that loses that corvette due to financial problems may ultimately lose the woman. In this situation, a woman who values materialism may divorce the man when she discovers he no longer will own the beautiful new corvette. 

In addition, youth who value materialism may face many problems as it relates to peer pressure in the educational system. There have been many instances where movies and music have promoted a materialistic lifestyle to our youth. Oftentimes, our youth turn to violence to gain these materialistic possessions. Additionally, mutiple problems may develop within families due to youth having materialistic values. Some youth may even drop out of school because they are attracted to a life style that is not focused on education, but, is focused on gaining materialism.

In conclusion, modern society should criticize materialism and materlistic values as our youth are and family structure is at risk of being destroyed.
