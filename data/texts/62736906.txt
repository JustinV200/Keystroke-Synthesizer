People are much more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others instead of just their personal goals. The more people you have in your corner for support, the better. 

Often times, by helping others and doing things that bring them happiness, you establish a connection with that person. By forming this relationship, you are opening the door for this person to in return, help you achieve your own goal. If you believe in the laws of karma, you will know that doing good things for others brings good things for you. Studies have shown that people are happier when they participate in acts of generosity such as volunteering in their communities, donating to charity, and random acts of kindess for their loved ones. 

Family and spousal happiness can also be beneficial for one's personal goals. Having a happy relationship with the important people in your life can boost your self esteem, and make you feel secure and supported, which in turn will make you work harder and perform better. Doing kind things for others can also help form a positive image for yourself. People will think of you and remember those things your did to brighten their day.

Finally, a wise man once said "love makes the world go round", and that quote is true now more than ever. With all the terrible things that happen in the world, passing along a little kindness goes a long way. You never know who's day you're turning around, and you never know what opportunities might be available with that person in the future. Life is a garden. Dig it!
