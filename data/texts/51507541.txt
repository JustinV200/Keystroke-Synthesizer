   Throughout time people have always had the options of cooperating with one another or competing against each other to achieve their goals. Both options produce results, and arguments can be made for both sides. One believes that competition will always produce longer lasting advancements, and in the following this ideal will be outlined.
   Competition has always existed throughout history. It has brought with it countless advancements and will no doubtedly continue to do so. Take into account the race to the moon, for instance. The "space race" was a competition between the USA and the USSR to land a person / people on the moon first. During this time mankind saw rapid technological advancements not just in air travel, but in computers as well. One should also take into account the amount of vehicle manufacturers that are available to the public. Each of these are competing and every year vast advancements are made in the field of personal transportation. One should also look to their cell phones if they wish to see how competition pushes advancements further. Regardless of the fact that there are only two major players in this area, the constant competition between Apple and Android has propelled the technology farther than what was though possible just thirty years ago.
   Healthy, active competition between companies has always and will continue to propel advancements much faster than cooperation. History has proven that as long as competition is active, mankind will continue to strive to advance in various fields.
