  There's alot of debate on if bieng competative makes you somehow better personally, there is also other opinions on the idea that bieng a cooperative person works better in the long term.
what do you think? Which idea best represents you?
  If you ask me i think both ideas have some credibility to them, but i lean more to the cooperative stance. Heres why, sure bieng competative gives you alot of credit, heck alot of the times you even get awards, recognition, and it even boosts your confidence. But i think all that is just self centered, which in my opinion can turn in to a me thing, an ego centric point.
  Cooperative on the other hand is very different, you arent just thinking of yourself, you have help, you have a team, and that team needs you and you need them to succeed, and well in one point in our life we all need help. It just sound healthier to me to be cooperative.
You don't win a sports game alone, you don't win a war alone. Sure some individuals stand out, but they had a team a group to back them up. There is no I in team.
  But yes guys that is just my point of view, bieng cooperative is better in the long run. it has its benifits, mentally and phisically. Mentally because you'll find that you are much happier with others around and celebrating together.
