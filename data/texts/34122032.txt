Happiness is everyone's goal. To achieve happiness is everyone's lifetime target. Two questions came about, are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or are they more likely to be happy based on the happiness of others?

Everyone is different. Physically, emotionally and perceptionally. One can assume that one's happiness is achievable by doing all the stuff that he or she want for themselves, benefitting themselves and only them. This person can go and choose their own career, and have a path towards the happiness that they envision. They can have a chosen career and have a sense of fulfillment. One can also assume that one's happiness can be attained by doing stuff for other people. This person can help others, for example, during a calamity. This person gets a feeling of happiness by helping out other people during calamities. Giving out relief goods or by donating money gives this person a sense of joy. 

So happiness, acquiring or achieveing it, is not a set rule. One can be happy just by sitting and typing. Only because there are words to type. One can also be happy sitting,  typing and helping someone through the words that they are typing. Happiness can come from within your own environment or from outside your environment. As long as we all have a goal in pursuing it, then that is all that matters.
