                In my opinion , exactly the same way physical appearance  can have an effect on people's of at first glance.  I meet dozens of people online. everyone has a picture, or lack of one. their profile picture gives first impression of them. their pictur could be anything from a picture of them , to an avatar, to a character , or just a letter or defult picture. Each of these make people think of.

               Of course they do. first impressions are very powerful for almost everybody. It's possible to change my opinion after having gotten a first impression , but that first impression never realy goes away. this works for both positive and negative first impression . while it is true that I never get a second chance to make a first impression , it is more accurate to say that i have to work hard to change a first impression.

                The definition of image is the general impression that a person, organization , or product presents to the public. the key word here is presents. in other words , image is what show to the world, and is not necessarily true. so may be image can be important , but this will last as long as i able to maintain it, if it's not true.
