Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others? This is a very good question. Firstly I think we should attempt to try and pin down happiness as a definition. I think this is going to be a little tricky as happiness is a very subjective thing that varies from person to person. For one person, happiness may be having a day to day job, a roof over ones head and money to buy shopping. For another person happiness could be a half eaten pizza scoped out the bin behind a Walmart somewhere*. 

How do we even begin to quantify such an empheral thing? I am no expert on the subject, being a right miserable git at the moment, so I will take a moment to consider both Jesus Christ and Sidartha Gottama the original Budah. They took kind of dissimilar stances here. In my opinion, Jesus seemed more to be from the camp of that the happiness of others would be the gold ring here, whereas Sidartha seemed to think that all desires, up to and including happiness, should be eliminated to progress with ones personal spiritual growth. Having met both Christians and Budhists I am going to have to say, that the Budhists seem a LOT happier in themselves*1. 

So having failed to quantify Happiness, now I must attempt to work out if happiness for others or persuing my own goals and dreams is the way to go. Well, let me tell you I can't. I do not think its a clear cut case of one or the other. I think you have to do both for A Maxium Happy Stat of +20*2 (which is a natural 20 btw) play both sides there, go for the maximum spread bet. 

One could also use Pascals Wager*3 as a basis for finding happiness in the happiness and wellbeing of others. Quick run down if you don't know, Pascal pretty much said that 'ey son it dun matter a toss if there is an afterlife or not ya dig man? It's nice to be nice, and if there is not, you've lost nothing but lived a good nice life and not been a dickhead yo? And if so, yeeeeah boi! You just won eternal life for something you was doing anyway eh?'*4 

So, pretty much I feel, in the imortal words of Grandpa Simpson: "A little from column A, a little from Column B"*5 I however can be utterly utterly stone cold wrong. I have been known to do that from time to time. Perhaps true happiness can only come from within? Perhaps it can only come from without? I feel that was a The Monkees song, Within/Without You?*6. Some claim happiness can be found at the bottom of a bottle, and I have attempted to test this hypothesis, repeatedly but only found hangovers down there.

All in all, I do believe that happiness is fleeting, life is crushing and cruel, life is no beach (unless it is*7) and you got to take your giggles and fun where and when you can, because it could all be over between your next two heart beats. As the old cheesy song says: 

Happiness, Happiness The Greatest Gift That I possess. Yeah...

Another old song by the venerable wise sages Napalm Death tells us: 

YOU SUFFER BUT WHY?

Thanks, that was my TED talk, I will be here all week, please try the fish of the day. It's Hake.
