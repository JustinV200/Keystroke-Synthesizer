I believe people are happier when focused on the happiness of others.  It takes more effort than satisfying onself and therefore, is more rewarding.  If a person buys an ice cream cone and eats the ice cream cone, once it's gone it is gone.  But, if a person buys a child an ice cream cone and the child eats the ice cream cone, the child's smile and enjoyment will come to mind again later and provide a feeling of happiness and satisfaction.

Providing happiness for others offers a sense of peace and contentment.  One might believe the Bible in fact directs us towards this behavior.  Isn't that how Jesus lived?  I also think that is the lesson to be learned from author Maugham's, Of Human Bondage.  Others may think it a love story, as mistakenly portrayed in film, but the happiness earned by doing for others is the true lesson.

Of course, others will argue that serving oneself is the road to happiness.  Achieving self indulged dreams and goals with nobody to share these victories with.  Such an empty victory!  And to what result?  Bragging rights?  No thanks.  In fact, when keeping the happiness given to others private, the happiness provided by the giver can be replayed in his or her mind over and over again with little depletion of the original contentment.  

Striving to offer others happiness in my lifetime has been my greatest reward.  Providing endless pleasant memories and in return, my own peaks of happiness.
