Without help you fail. You feel better because you have accomplished your goals and they feel better merely by helping. Thereby, entering a muluastic relationship where both help each other. Helping one other is important for each person to be successful. Without help you fail and do not meet your deadline. However with help you meet your deadline and you have achieved success. You now are more inclined to help them in the future when they need help too. Thereby creating a chain of mutual support.

Now when you help someone else out  you feel good, because you know that you helped them, without your help they would have failed. But since you helped they did not fail and you have contributed to their success. Helping people feels good and increases your endorphins. In addition, helping  others is an important way to stay connected to the people you care about and want to support.

Therefore, helping people is a great way to stay connected and ensure that both parties achieve success in everything they try to accomplish. It is a personally satisfying thing to do since it makes your feel good and you know that you have helped someone.
