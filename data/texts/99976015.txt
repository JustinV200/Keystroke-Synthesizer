I don't believe that images and impressions have "too much" of an effect on people. There is nothing wrong with enjoying beauty. It would be like saying that too much attention is given to Michaelangelo's sculptures. 

While many will point to some politicians as examples of people voting based on a person's looks, such as Presidents Obama and Kennedy, there have been many more examples of the opposite being true. I doubt anyone would say that Presidents Trump or Nixon were voted in because they were good looking. I would say that Presidents Obama and Kennedy were looked upon favorably not so much because of their looks but because of their youthfulness.

Entertainment is another area in which people say looks matter more than talent, but evidence says otherwise. Lizzo is one of the hottest musicians in the world right now, and she is hardly the embodiment of good looks. Also, one needs to remember that entertainers are there to entertain, and part of that could be looking "beautiful". If a person is paying their hard earned money to go to the movies, it's completely their right to prefer movie actors that are pleasing to look at. This goes for all sexes and sexual orientations.

In closing, people can place as much emphasis on appearances as they want to. It's not up to us to tell others how they should weigh different attributes. And evidence shows that it isn't a big issue to begin with.
