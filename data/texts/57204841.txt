For most people I believe they do people see them then start believing they are the real  things. 
For example people see a image of food and believe they are hungry or can see a political image of 
something like kids being kept in cages like animals and believe it.
                    Images can be a powerful tool used for good and bad some can help you make choices on what to eat or what furniture to buy others image can bring hate. Hate sometimes is used in the wrong way like in political or social content. We as people see an image and believe the camara don't lie.
                         Lately the abuse of this power seems to be bringing people to fight against each other. Seems you have to dig for the good images that are motivating and peaceful. Lets see more images of people helping people or parents and kids together.
                            Images are needed in the end for that visualization so people can understand what going on so good or bad we need these images in our life. We as humans can only try to understand why these images have so much effect on us and why we react to them the way we do.
