Why cannot ones happiness be combined with the happiness of others? For one thing, the more people you try to make or help make happy the more that happiness is more elusive due to so many viewpoints of what constitues happiness. Happiness can be elusive due to our demands for ever instant experiences of it. Society tells us that we must be happy ourselves before helping anyone else. 

To be happy in my life I look to my personal goals first then focus on what can I do to include others in achieving those goals.  Where I can I include others in the completion of those goals to ensure I get them accomplished but to also share in the accomplishment so that others can feel the joy of achieving success as well. A shared goal accomplished brings happiness as well as contentment of a job well done which is a different aspect of happiness. 

I find that shared goal accomplishment reveals and results in the sharing of learning and happiness in a job well done. For instance take the occasion when various people form a support group for a neighbor, friend, father and spouse who has been physically disabled from a fall off a roof. They each provide care, rides, and encouragement to said fellow and they all share in his victories. When he moves forward with a re-learned skill or movement they all cheer as they have all contributed to his achieving this success which is leading to his ability to live more independently once again. His happiness leads to their shared happiness.  Focusing on the happiness of others brings more happiness for all.
