        Competition is the most important element in achieving success and promoting goals at work, in sports, school and most importantly, life.  Competition is necessary to encourage individuals to produce their best work because they are being compared to other individuals.  I do not believe rivalry always brings out the worst in individuals.  Although many believe competition takes away from cooperation, I believe competing with others is the key to one's success or failure, as well as a team's success or failure.  Competition also prepares people for life experiences. It will teach individuals the world is not always a fair place.

       Competition can however, exist with cooperation.  With cooperation, there is a positive team oriented aspect that is not achieved through pure individual competition. In cooperation, people may default to working together, but also not present their best ideas and default to others.  You can be compeitive, but also cooperative within a team or in society.  With competition, I believe there is push to achieve the best results from each individual, and thus competition creates the best "team dynamic." Humans are innately competitive and when working cooperatively in groups, the best individual idea, or the Type A individuals, will emerge from the group.  This is due to human competitive nature.  

       In conclusion, I believe competition is the key to individual and organization success. Cooperation and competition can exist together, but people can achieve more success through competition by competing against others and producing their best individual performance. This will help the "team" achieve their goals.
