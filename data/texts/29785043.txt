Everyone should focus on making others happy if they want to be happy themselves. Doing so will keep our minds focused on helping each other become better humans and elevating good in our society. This is far more fulfilling and rewarding than acheiving personal goals. Acheiving a goal is a fleeting thought and so are the feelings that accompany it. 

The Law of Reciprocity is real. We must give to get. So, if you want to experience happiness, you must make others happy first. This is quite simple and easy to do. Performing random acts of kindness is a great way to give back and put a smile on someone's face. 

I have seen this evidenced in my and my friends' life several times over the years. My friends and I would pay for random people's meals at a restaurant or buy food to distribute to the homeless. Whenever the receipent's face would light up with joy, it made my friends and I smile and experience happiness, too.

Some people may disagree and believe that happiness comes from personal goal acheivement. Acheiving a goal is a one time event but positively impacting the lives of others will bring long lasting happiness.

I have seen this happen over and over in my life and I prefer to rely on life experience. Once I acheived a goal I was happy in that moment, then I immediately moved on to the next goal on my list. Knowing that I've positively contributed to another person's happiness will bring me enough happiness to last a lifetime.
