How often have you been persuaded to buy something you didn't need? Have you read about a famours person and believed them to be a certain way, only to discover later that they were very different from how they initially appeared? What about reading excellent reviews on a website regarding a product and finding out that the product is not what it claimed to be after you purchased it? All of these are examples of how the truth, the reality of something isn't always what it appears to be.
Every day we are inundated with situations that try to deceive us. Most of the time it seems that this saturation is an attempt to gain something from us, whether that be trust, respect, time, or money. Advertisements are especially invasive, as we see them everywhere. Billboards mark the landscape as we drive, television is funded through advertisements, and internet ads often interrupt as we scroll through articles. There is little relief from images that try to sway us to believe that their product is the best. Celebrities, either A-listers or reality personalities, try to present their image and personal brand. Often it is hard to determine what is true and what is not.
Many people will say, "Seeing is believing." While there is some truth to this adage, appearances can often be deceiving. Truth about a person, a situation, a product, or service is really shown over time. It is the results and actions that reveal true character. Others feel that a product or person cannot gain popularity without being true to their claims or appearances. However, experience has shown that popularity does not always equal merit.
While we are bombarded and too often affected by what we see, it is important to consider what is important to us, to our true selves, and to not be easily swayed by the images and impressions that others, especially companies, put upon us. Being mindful of how effective marketing is will help us to not be overly affected by what we see.
