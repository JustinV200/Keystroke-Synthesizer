According to my opinion in our grandparents and before that days they were not much people interested to use their knowledge in technical way. Some of the people interesting to improve the technology and now we are in this situation. 
Now almost all people interested to spending their knowledge in useful way. It means we want every function or work in easy way and reduce the time. So focus on smart way technique. So modern society not to blame, the old people and don't want to improve their stage in their only that people against the modern life. 
Modern society is not a materilistic. When it comes to materilistic we did not give important to humans feelings. Time consuming is the way of being smart. It develop our knowledge in wide. In old days people follow their leads not took the decision independently. But now a days people use their knowledge and making decision independently. It leads to improve our knowledge and get what we want.
The modern life leads our world to technology oriented. The technology easily makes us live and not hard to search things. Every people want to be independent so this modern society gives our needs and fulfill our dreams.
