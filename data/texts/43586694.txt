     Being materialistic may lead to be selfish. Modern society may growp up with the idea or thought of materialism. They don't know how to be with relation and to adjust within the relation. Now-a-days, most of the children want to be independent and they don't want to know about their parents situation due to this materialism.

     Being materialistic may lead to be a careless. They may not have any saving and they may spend some others savings in a wrong way. Now-a-days we heard that some children are addicted to illegal drugs in many news, but a decade ago we heard these news at the rate of .0001% , this generation got addicted to these things because of materialism. 

     This generation people are speding their time in waste things, like playing games all the time, hanging with friends unnecessarily, eating more foods unwantedly, wasting foods, money, etc,.. These things happens because of this mateiralism. So people should avoid being materialistic. Once they avoid being materialistic, they could  have a good life in future. 

     So the way to control these to be materialistic is by giving seminars, and the parents or friends or family members should speak out those people and make those people to speak out their minds. And make them to come out from that thought by giving some live examples.
