Some people say materialism poisons everything in modern society, since it creates a vicous circle in trying to satisfy people's enlarging desire. However, materialism can also be the motivation behind productivity technology innovation.

The excessive use of social media is one of the reason why materialism recieved so much criticism. On one hand, social media brings overnight fame, which makes young peopele think material desires are easily to be fulfilled, therefore, a luxury lifestyle as a representation of materalism became a pursuit for many young people. On the other hand, social media help companies create wantings that people never known they had. The more advertisement you see and the more variety of products that you can choose from, the more likely you are going to attain that curiosity and desire. 

Also, materalism can be dentrimental to environmental. Manufacturing, pollution and waste produced by commercial goods is threatening the earth. Poeple may argue that jobs created by materalism are beneficial to the society. However, benefits it brings is easily outweighted byb the harm it does to the environment.

However, the desire to satisfy material desire may lead to innovation and higher productivity. For example, automatic vacumm cleaner is an expansive alternative to clean the floor by yourself, but the time saved by using an automatic vacumm can be used on other productive activities, and the mental bandwidth saved by less houseworks may be even more beneficial to your productivity. 

Overall speaking, excessive materalism should not be aim as the purpose of out lives, but it can also help us to have a more productive, easier and happier life.
