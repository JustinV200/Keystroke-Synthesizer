   Happiness is different for each people. Happiness is a beautiful word which creates positive vibes. Here, i am goint to write about happiness comes by pursing their dreams and their own personal goals.
    Everyone has a own personnal goals. we worked hard for to achieve our dreams. Our dream is our identity. Without pursing our goals we are just an unusable thing. There is no happiness lies without fullfilling our dreams. But we work hard to achieve our goals. Real happiness lies on that day when our dreams come realistic. There is no words to describe that feelings.  Everyone sourrand also feel the positive vibes when our dream come true. 
     My dream is to  start a new business.  I worked vey hard on intial stages. MY intial stages was very difficult. NO one support for my dream.   I run for help from several persone. But i can only get help from  supported friends. Then slowly i get up from my failures. I know about some logical things behind my business. I learn how to succeed and how to face failures without get  depressions. I felt very happy on that day. No words to describe my  happiness. I felt very proud about me on that day. Pursiuing our goals in one of the happiest  moment in our life.
