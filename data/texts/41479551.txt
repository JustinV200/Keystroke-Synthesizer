Happiness is a rewarding state of being, for it seems to make all you do to attain happiness worthwhile. I, however would argue that happiness comes with one clear stipulation, which is to first be realistic. I recall one philosopher who expressed it as "happiness begins with knowing what is possible." And, in my view, all good things are accompanied by being truthful with the situation at hand, the state of affairs, the circumstances involved, vs being so desperate to be happy that one becomes so idealistic that they've lost their sense of reality; that is, the way things really are according to not only oneself but everyone around them. I believe that being anything starts with a person's relationship with themself, since they must first nurture within themself that which they wish to then be able to pass on to others. Some people might be more attracted to the alturistic model that highlights helping others at the expense of personal sacrifice, and, indeed, there are moments when special forces conspire to call on those few who are willing to go over & beyond for the sake of something greater than themselves, even if they're not prepared, to move forward on the faith that the rightness of their deeds will make a significant difference, even against all odds. And from a spiritual understanding, I believe such callings will be revealed to those few at the time they're beckoned, and they will find their way, and, yes, they will be happy. However, the rest of us who live rather ordinary lives, and who thrive by doing the best we can any way we can do it, have a surer chance of being happy if we first tend to our own development and then share what we already have and know to work well.
