 Let's face it, we live in a materialistic society. I deserve my Starbucks, I deserve my Gucci, MY Rolex, MY iPhone, MY Nikes. I am a SELFmade individual. I work hard making gadgets for gizmos and by GOD I deserve it. I worke hard and I am rewarded. HE is on my side. But is a materialistic society sustainable? 
 
We tend to want things not only bigger, better and faster, but also latest, greatest and at a cheaper price so we can look like we are keeping up with the prophets on Instagram, Twitter and FaceBook - The Holy Trinity guiding us to instant gratification. These indulgences come at a cost.

 Children work in sweatshops to help feed their families so our children can show off their new iPhone while slaving away to get an education. The Amazon rainforest is being decimated and natives murdered so we can have beef for dinner. Wedding party members are killed by drones but, hey, we deserve an "oops" when we're looking out for our own self interests. I. We. Me.

It's said that modern society cannot survive without materialism, but how muck of that gospel is being regurgitated by the one percenters in this world? Perhaps it's time we start looking at what we're doing and take some responsibility.
