To cooperate or compete, that is the question.  Too often these days, more people compete against others more than cooperate, even when it comes to family and friends.  Sports, business, recreation, hobbies, even politics and religion have now become a competition.  Mine is better than yours.  My views are more valid than yours.  You're a loser, I'm the Winner.  And if I lose, then you cheated.  Competition like this helps no one.  It only destroys the whole.

While competition is good, and healthy, and useful in a society, cooperation is equally good, better actually, because if we can't cooperate, then how can we advance as a species.  Competition brings forth anger towards others, the thought of being better than your opponent, and more times than not, belittling others.  Hurting others that you are competing against.

This can be seen during any sports game.  Take a football game for example.  Sometimes watching a game can be exciting.  A game where both cooperation and competition is evident.  Cooperation with your teammates is needed, and competition against the opposing team is desirable.  Competition sometimes brings out the worst in people though.  Watch a football game.  After a touchdown, or a tackle, watch how the players react to their opponent(s).  Do they respond gracefully, or do they react by doing a stupid dance or reacting in a way that only disrespects the other team?  

Cooperation by contrast brings out the best in people.  Helping each other, lifting each other up, building on each others strengths, helps everyone involved .   Competition helps an individual, or a small group of people, while cooperation helps everyone.
