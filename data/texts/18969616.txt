     I strongly believe that images and impressions have a negative impact on todays modern society. That includes misleading commercials and the overall appearences of people.
     When it comes to advertisements, companies will always mislead their audience by mainipulating the image of what they are actually presenting. An example can be the cereal boxes found on the racks of grocery stores. To the eye, the vibrant colors and photoshopped images can definitely catch someones attention. Tactics like these play a big role in the economic system. Without an eye-catching logo or cover for your company, you won't strive in today's economic system. And that could be a con for consumers. Although the packaging might promise satisfaction, what's actually inside might dissapoint in the end. This leads to a world where people have to generally be cautious of what companies are promoting based on visiual appearance.
    Not only is the economic system influeced by looks and appearences, but average everday humans are constantly being prejudged by their looks alone. Take for example, dating apps. Although most dating apps allow people to list their hobbies and background information, others will mostly focus on someones visual appearence before their likes and dislikes.  This also occurs in real life too. Most people in today's society with higher ranks can be explained through their looks rather than their effort. If you have good looks, you'll be treated better. Even if your personaility isn't so likeable, your looks give off the first impression on others.
      To conclude, simple things like grocery items and bigger things like the rankings in society are heavily influenced by the visual appearce. What people see in the end starts becoming more important than other things.
