Today many people put way too much emphasis on their own image and that of others. Their impressions tend to be that of superficial content and not an original mindset. We are so used to the status quo agenda that we forget we are all uniquely and indiviually created. We all have our own set of criteria that makes up who we are but have forgotten how to utilize our own mind for a place of higher thinking in this world.  

I feel that we need to go back to a simpler time when life had true meaning. People genuinely cared about each other, about helping one another and actually trying to make their lives for a better good in society not just because it looked good in the public eye. In simpler times life seemed to be more about the good of others and the good of ourselves than to see how many likes we could get on social media.

Yes we are living in a different time now. We are living a cycle of the let's see how fast we can get from here to there, how much stuff we can acquire, and how high up the corporate ladder we can climb that before we know it we are at the end of our lives and haven't really accompished very much at all. This world is not what it used to be but what would it look like to have one by one individuals begin taking a stand to change where we are now to something similar to where we used to be? It only takes one step at a time to make a change and a difference in the world to start a revolution of change. 

Let's all take a minute to really look at our own life and the lives of those around us to see if a new direction could improve our way of life going forward. I for one am looking deep inside myself to try to make a change for the better because Lord knows the direction we are headed is not a good one. We would only be fooling ourselves if we think we can continue on a momentum of an "It's all about me" mentality and still succeed in this world. That will only work for so long until the next one takes over the stardom field.
