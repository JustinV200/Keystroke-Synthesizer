Success is a measure that everyone on one level or another strives for.  There are many ways that success can be achieved to bring forth the desired results.  In this writing project I will introduce two of the most common ones of them for you and explain why I think one is better.  

Two of the most popular ways to achieve success is through cooperation or competition.  While both of these can work I do believe one is a much better alternative.  One that not only gets you where you want to be but with the ability to raise those you are working with to a higher level.  With that said I am a big proponent and very much believe in the approach of cooperation.  Cooperation brings out the best in all people.  It allows everyone to have a stake in the desired result.  It allows everyone to share their ideas and tactics in order to achieve a goal.  This is important because people from all backgrounds and walks of life can have a direct impact on the results.  They can come together in a cooperative environment where teamwork becomes key, commardrie and togetherness come together to get the job done with the desired results.  While success can be achieve through competition its no the best for us a community.  Competition brings forth winners and losers where some do not have the ability to suceed and those that do accomplish it at their exspense.  

So in reflection I do believe that cooperation is the best way to proceed when you are looking for success.  It takes the best qualities of everyone and lifts them up together.  Shared goals lead to shared success.  There is no other way for this to be accomplished that brings everyone together with a goal of a successful outcome and result like cooperation.
