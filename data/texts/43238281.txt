Society as a whole has become materialistic over the years. There is always some new gadget that is coming out to make our lives "easier", a new phone that is bigger and better, or a bigger better vehicle that makes traveling more comfortable. For being as advanced as we are, we should be criticized for being materialistic. We keep purchasing new products but these items are cheaply made and do not last, we throw them away (no recycling), and we harm the environment. Eventually we will wake up one day and the Earth will be destroyed. 
A new trend right now is purchasing items that make cleaning at home easier. There are hundreds of videos floating around social media of a woman showing off what gadgets she uses while her husband is sleeping. She has foldable fans, miniature clothes washers, five or six different kind of vacuums, makeup organizers and toothbrush holders with toothpaste automatic dispensers. While these items may be useful, they are not lasting for very long and instead of recycling what we can, we just throw everything away. 
Having a vacuum for every different type of flooring you have, including having one for your bed, is useful and maybe if you keep up with maitenance, they will last for some time. These items just useful for short term pleasure. Everything these days is cheaply made and will break easily. We need to start pushing that the more expensive items require saving up for, but will last for years to come. Society can be materialisitc and do so without harming the environment. If we wouldn't hurt the environment, we could be materialistic without needing to be criticized.
