The great "American Dream" has always been having a good job, being able to afford things, and living a great life.  The basis for that dream is the concept of money and spending that money to live a life.  Is there anything wrong with having materialistic dreams?  Why are we so quick to judge and criticize people for buying things and striving for material possessions?  I believe there is nothing wrong with having materialistic goals and we should not criticize people for wanting to buy, collect, and have possessions.  It is a requirement to live a life and therefore should not be judged.  

People should not be criticized for being materialistic and wanting to have things.  Day to day life requires physical possessions - you need a house to live in, you need a car to get to work, you need to buy food to survive.  Everything is built on the idea of having money and being able to buy things.  This is paramount to living in any country.  You cannot judge someone on something that is required for day-to-day life.  

Where materialistic efforts get criticism is collecting possessions and things for the sole purpose of showing them off, being boastful.  Materialism is different from being boastful though.  Collecting things to show off should be criticized, it is using your possessions to inflict emotional pain on people.  Materialism is not boastful though - wanting to have things to live is not being boastful.  It is living your life.  

In summary, people should not be criticized for wanting to have possessions.  We life in a society that is built on earning money and then spending that money to consume things necessary for life.  People can be criticized for using their possessions to illicit a reaction from people such as boasting.  But materialistic desires and being boastful are two different things.  Wanting to be able to afford things should not be held against people.
