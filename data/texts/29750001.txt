If those people are feeling blue, the people that emotionally depends of them, will be feeling blue. or if those people are feeling happy or energetic, they will be able to feel like that. i think that it´s hard to not be emotional depending on someone, because it´s hard sometimes to understand your feelings and trut yourself and the process of find your own happiness; 
 
But you shouldn´t emotionally depend of someone else, because you are supposed to find your happiness on your own. and for me, yes, i´m more likely to be happy if i focus on my personals goals, because at the end of the day, my life and my future depends of me, not on somebody else than me. and usually the people that emotionally depend on others, are more likely, instead of being happy, to have personal issues about their feelings and some people may suffer depression.
