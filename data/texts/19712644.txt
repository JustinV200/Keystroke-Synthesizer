The topic on whether one can be happy if he or she focuses on their goals or rather on the happiness of the others have been the main topic of discussion recently. With studies and research in place  however, focusing on ourselves and focuing on others tend to bring out different impacts upon our lives. However according to me, people are more likely to be more happy if they focus on their goals rather than focusing on the happiness of the others. When one focuses on his or her goals, one is able to strive towards achieveing what one desires or requires. When one accomplishes his or her targets, this proves to be a turning point in their lifes since they have achieved what they aspired for. 

With well stipulated goals, they can make one more happier since it leads one to major his or her focus on what one wants. It also enables one to take charge of his or her life in the format or way they would prefer to live. Focusing on one's goals also leads to increase in self confidence and that of enthusiasm. With enhanced sense of confidence, one can be happy since a sense of belonging has set in. When one focuses on the happiness of the others, they may end up being hurt since their ways might not be going on well. This feeling will result to an individual not being happy.
 
In conclusion, its thus evident that people are more likely to be happy when they tend to focus on their own goals rather than depending on the happiness of the others. Focusing on ones goals result to a sense of belonging thus creating more happiness. Therefore, for the sake of our happiness, we should always strive to focus more on our personal goals. There is nothing more sweeter than seeing yourself achieve your personal goals.
