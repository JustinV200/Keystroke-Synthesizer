some people believe happiness is based on their dreams and their own personal goals but real happiness is based on helping people who are in needs and help them to achieve is the only real happiness. If someone have money to their night with their girlfriend or friends in Italian restaurent and great candle light dinner or whatever they want to spend their time and money with them.
 
But me want to spend that kind of money in the people who are in their needs wanna help some childs for their educational needs or anyother I want to spend some money and the time something valuable more than any other. Spend with the  needed and their needs it aso wonderful feel .

I never tell personal happiness wrong or bad thing but for myself i wanna spend that money on something useful to others that makes myself happy and feel peace in my mind i strongly suggest to help the people who are in need and their happiness feel us so happy and their needs. why we never think more than ourselves its such a wonderful world to do wonderful things achieving goals is good but help to achieve others too...
