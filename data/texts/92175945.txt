 One could say that a person is happiest when they focus on their own personal goals - with one of those goals being contributing to the happiness of others around you. The world loves people who love themselves first. Being the center of your own universe is the best way to be happy. 


 A great example of putting the happiness of others above your own would be the steryotypical mom trope that can be seen on television. One can see that the mothers put everyone else's needs before their own and are burnt out. Typically the people around them, their children and spouses, don't appreciate them. On the other hand, the steryotypical father puts his needs and happiness above all and he appears ignorantly blissful. Typically they will splurge on a large item with no consideration for the family budget or make plans during the time of something their wife has previously told them she had plans for. Ideally, there would be a balance of taking care of one's self and others.

 In the long run, we all only have one life and it is important to be happy. Balance is key as well as remembering that no one can pour from an empty cup. Focus on your own goals first and then others
