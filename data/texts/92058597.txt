Modern society should be criticizied for being to materalistic. This is life some people are living in this world, to fit in and to be like someone else to be recognize. This type of life can cause serious damage and hurt to people. Now how can this be, simply if this person doesnt get the item or product, this person would do anything to get that item even if it risking life.  This is why I say modern society should be criticized for being materlaistic.

Not everything should be focued on materalistic stuff. They are other more important things to do in life and in this world than just spending time and money on material stuff. There are so much other things to do than just wanting what other people want or have to look or be like others.  They should be less focus on materlaistic stuff and this is why I say that modernsociety should be criticized for being materalistic.

Getting use to materalistic stuff is a very bad habit. that will drag you down, making you spend, go crazy if you cany get  to it. Materlaistic stuff causes people to steal, kill, go to prison and so much more. Adults loving materlistic stuff , kids growing up to love and want materlistic stuff also it is sad and terrible. different things should be thought in this world than materalistic stuff. growing up in a materlaistic world is disgusting.
