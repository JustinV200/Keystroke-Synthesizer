The meaning of happiness has been debated for centuries. Some argue for a personal happiness - that is, forming one's own goals and pursuing those goals with the end result of happiness when the goals are attained. Others pursue a more altruistic happiness - their goals are based on the happiness of others or improving the lives of others. 
Self improvement and personal aspirations are indeed worthy goals. It is not only useful but wise to maintain career aspirations. Few people would wish to be jobless or stuck in a job they dislike with little to no chance of promotion. Many personal goals carry along with them desires for other things such as money and status. And we are all familiar with the cliche that money does not buy happiness. What are money and status good for if you have no one to share your experiences with? Are we truly happy if we have no one with whom to share life's joys, as well as life's struggles?
I would argue that it is in the happiness of others where we ultimately find our own happiness. Seeing someone else smile or seeing someone else celebrate an accomplishment is where I draw my happiness from. Last week my son brought home his first report card with letter grades. My wife and I opened the report card and looked at it first, then handed it to him. His eyes widened and a huge smile came across his face as he saw all A's. Seeing him be proud of himself and his hard work made me happier than anything I could have done for myself.
