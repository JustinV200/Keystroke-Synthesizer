We humans have always been judging things by its outer appearance and not caring about the inner contents, everyone strives for beautiful things, people prefer the outer image too much, and what else is better to capitalize on? now a days you can't find a honest ad anywhere, its all filled with colors and lies.

We being the gulible human we fall for these colors and lies, we find true beauty in these lies and deceit. We think of the celebrities that appear on TV as a perfect being, because of all the lights and colors. Which is anything but the truth, they are even more vunurable than one might think. Always being ready to look good, to make a good impressions - these are the thoughts that always goes through their minds, they can't relax for even a single second lest their perfect form be ruined. But as gulible we are we fall for it. So much so that we now  judge people that are not putting up with the "perfect" human look. If a celebrity promotes and fashion product we rush to buy it, why? because some seemingly "perfect" human said that it was of good quality which they were paid handsomely to say.

Falling for these petty lies is really unbecoming of us humans. We were supposed to be the greatest being in earth, and yet falling for these tricks as moths fall for the lights. How long will this go on? - that is a answer we don't know of yet, if we keep doing these soon enough we will make some theiving liars really prosperous.
