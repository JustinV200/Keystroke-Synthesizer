Everyone's reality is more important for the society. People do not know how the reality of the people around everyone. We must know the reality of the people. Every peoples reality is more important. People are not showing their reality in media. We must aware of every peoples behavior and their character.
       All must know about the people in media we have to know everything before we enter into something in our life. More important for life is  we have to know about the variation of people. We have to work and speak based on their abilities. We must more independent in our life. We have to live our life independently not depend on anyone else. 
        Media is just a entertainment for everones life. But the reality is we are spending more time in the imaginery world. This is not that much possible to  live a reality of our life.
