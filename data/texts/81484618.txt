In a philosophical sense, prehaps we could critize socity for being too materialistic. It's not something that people think of as positive, after all. Yet in a pratical sense, critizing someone for gathering more money is about equilivent to critizing someone for gathering more food - you need money to live in modren socitey. You're effectively forced to earn enough money to continue to live proberly with food as well as shelter. 

One could argue that's the problem - that socitey should be set up in such as way that materalism isn't required or nessary for life. Other persuits, such as family or faith, tend to be considred as morally above materialism. But there is no pratical replacement. Until the invention of the replicator, materialism will continue to be a mandatory and nessary part of human life. You can't feed your family by praying to God, and you can't pay rent with love. Thus, we cannot punish people or think less of them for engaging in it. It would be little different than vegans deriding a lion for eating meat, or a snake insisting that birds are too obsessed with flight.  

Creating new things, and using or consuming said things, is how humans live. We have managed to create a contradictory mindset regarding this - we deride materialism while at the same time requiring it and continuing to do so in our daily lives. In fact, many of us idolize those who are the best at materilism. Those with lots of wealth are effectively above social norms and in some cases the law itself simply because they have managed to accquire a lot of money. This does not fit with an anti-materialism mindset. Next time you think about materialism, think about everything it's a part of, and consider if you wish to critizise those things as well.
