Materialism, or aquiring possessions and spending money, is rampant in our society. Should our society and country be criticized for its vast materialism? In my opinion it should.

Firstly, we are currently in a recession and inflation is increasing. When these factors plus materialism combine, there is increased pressure on people to spend money they don't have in order to "keep up with the Joneses." This can cause overspending and debt at a time when money is already stretched thin.

Secondly, materialism can cause issues with self-esteem. When a person sees the materialism that is on display on social media, it can cause feelings of inadequacy when they cannot afford the same lifestyles. We have enough to be depressed about in this country; we don't need the added stress of needing to show off the newest fashions or gadgets to strangers on the internet.

Lastly, I believe that materialism is toxic to progressing our society for the better. We need to put more money towards social issues and problems. When the billionaires in our society spend unfathomable amounts of money towards vanity projects while the less fortunate suffer we cannot become the country we could be. 

In conclusion, I believe that our society would benefit by steering away from materialism and that our current fixation on materialism is worthy of criticism. When our values shift away from hoarding money and possessions and towards the betterment of society we will all benefit.
