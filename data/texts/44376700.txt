     It seems to me that, following the prompt, it is not a matter of either or, but, rather, both and. People's happiness is reached by dicysing on one's own hapopiness, AND, by fociainf on the needs/happiness of others. At the beginning of a person;s pursuits in life they are typically very selfish and are only worried about their own happiness, accomplishments, etc. As time goes o, especially if and when they have managed to fu;fill their basic needs, they look outside of themselves for fulfillment.

     Think of the pyramid that represents Maslow's hierarchy, for example, at the top "happiness" as defined by the fulfillment of needs beginning with the most basic and the most personal, You need Food, fire, water, shelter - in not particular order. As time goes on and you are (or I fuess have been) made "happy" by that fulfillment. And assuming our hero is not a malignant narcissist (like a certain ex poresident of the US for example). These are of coures then fillowed by psychological needs like belongongness, love and self-ssteem. Finally one looks outward and Id fulfilled by, basically, making others happy. Finally one gets to self-actialization, and in some versions of the hierarchy, transcendence.

     One could argue (and would be wrong) that these are all internak and therefore one would be simply be meeting their own needws/goa;s/sources of happinedd. Nut no, to reach the top of these needs, one needs to make oneseself happy by making others happy, so bee fully actuallized and trancend one;s selfish existence, one must reach outside oneself and go beyond "me", In doing so, our hero achieves happiness by meeting both his own needs, and contributes to fuklfilling the needs of their fellow humans.
