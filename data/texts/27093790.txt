Most people compare themselves to others.  We often compare the size of our houses and/or our bank accounts.  This basic human traits causes us to be competitive and strive for what someone else has.  This may foster a desire to work harder and achieve more success at work and play.  However, being competitive should not  encourage us to be ruthless or ignore the needs of others? 

People are born competitive.  If you are born into a large family, from the moment of birth you are competing for parental attention.  If you were involved in sports as a young child, you want to be on the winning team and win.  

In today's society, children are often given a mixed message.  The best player on the team will not necessary play all the time.  The philosophy is about giving each child, regardless of their ability, a chance to play.  Every child on every team will receive the same trophy.  Is this healthy?  What motivation does a player have to get better?  Does this attitude foster undying cooperation between teammates or a mediocore attitude toward life?    

I do believe that being cooperative and working together will be rewarding.  However, adults need to be hungry for success.  In a professional environment, it is important to cooperate with others, but it is also important to strive to be better than your co-workers in order to gain more success at work.   This can be accomplished in a healthy way by working hard and always looking for opportunities to improve. 

It is important to be cooperative, but in order to accomplish new things, you must look for new opportunities and engage yourself in healthy competition with your peers and coworkers. This will enable you to be striving for a better future.
