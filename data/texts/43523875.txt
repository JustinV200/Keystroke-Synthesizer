 Hello !!! 
      In my point of view and though " Happiness is the key to the sucess " and that happiness is acheived by getting success in our own personal goal and as well as helping others in acheiving their goal. mainly happiness stays more close  and long when it lies with some other's success with help of us. let me explain you with the great example as follows :

        If my personal goal is to start up a company and I have enough amount of money as well as source. But  at the same time I want to give oppurtunity to the young minds who are in much need and also have their very own talent. At that part of time I gave the oppurtunity to those young talents to acheive their goal.

      In this scenerio it is clear that  I acheived my goal that mean a personal goal of opening a company and also helped some others to acheive their goal. My happiness here lies in acheiving my goals and at the same time happiness of others. Whatver the suitation may be here the main thing is " Happiness Matters ". Happiness is everywhere and only thing is we have to look out it.

Thank you !! for giving the oppurtunity to express my thoughts. Have a great and happy reading. May your smile last forever.
