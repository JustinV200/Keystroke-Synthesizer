People are more likely to find happiness if they focus on their personal goals. It's true that some people believe finding happiness lies in focusing on the happiness of others but let me tell you why that isn't true. To find true happiness someone must consider their personal goals at all times. The reason for this is, by focusing on personal goals one has a better chance of achieving those goals. By achieving those goals it gives someone a sense of achievement and satisifaction by knowing what they're capable of. 

Depending on the goal it could also better someone's life by achieving it. For example, let's say someone's number one personal goal is to get promoted within the company they work for. This promotion comes with a significant pay raise. This pay raise would allow them to eat better food, enjoy higher quality entertainment, and even move to a better neighborhood. But, if they never focus most of their energy on the promotion they may never get it. 

I could give many examples and go on and on about how happiness comes from achieving personal goals but let me end it with this. Someone should never put their happiness in someone else's hands. By focusing mostly on the happiness of the people around you, you might forget about your own wants and needs. You have to think about what's more important in your life because at the end of the day, only you know whats best for you.
