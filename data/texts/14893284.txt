Introduction:
People can only be happy when they are focused on something other than their own happiness. Happiness arises when people put their attention on otherpeoples happiness, the advancement of humanity or some course of action that is pursued as an end in and of itself rather than as a means to an end.
Position:
We anticipate a particular outcome when we set a goal. A conservative goal yields a conservative outcome . Setting a high bar of ourself has the opposite effect,as we end up with amazing short or long term results.
Reasons and evidence:
My mother wont be happy even though she puts a lot of effort into making delicious meals with accurate results.If her child enjoyed the food more,it meant she had succedded in her goal and her life would be more happier as a result.
Arguments:
Some people wont get satisfied untill his goals fulfilled with a appropriate manner.but some persons get distresed if they  they cant attain a goal and show his angryness towards a loved ones. So we should give equal importance to our goal and to the people by spending time regarding the family functions and need to hear the words of several time.
Conclusion:
According to me ,we should give equal importance towards a pursuing our dreams and also focus or spending time witha loved ones makes the way to find their own happiness.
