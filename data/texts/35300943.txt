I believe that people can  become happy for multiple reasons in life and not just one. Personal goals, dreams, and the happiness of others are just some of the ways we make ourselfs happy but i dont believe it is a persons genuine happiness. I feel that happiness is something you have to already have in you before you can make anyone else or yourself happy. Like a choice in life. 

We can set a goal to create something that we feel is going to make us or bring us happiness but if we arnt happy when trying to make that goal then will we ever achive it. happiness isnt something i feel we create. Not to say it cant be created by helping someone else achive it or by getting what you want out of life but how does an unhappy person give happiness to themselfs or anyone else, humanity or what not. unhappy people dont make happy choices inlife because they arnt positive about anything unless that get some sort of happieness from it. which i find to be selfish people because you have to take the good with the bad and nothing is perfect.

 Happiness is a choice in everyones daily life, like putting your shoes on before walking outside so you dont hurt your feet on your gravel driveway. or making your bed after you wake, not because it needs to be made but because it makes you feel good and when you go to climb back in its perfect because you took that time to make it so you could injoy getting back in it and it helped with making your room look way better all day which inturn makes you feel great. So the choice is yours. chose to be happy in everything you do and you wont ever have to worry about chasing happiness.
