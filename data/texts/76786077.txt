You can't give away what you don't have. It's fine and dandy to preach altruism and things like loyalty and devotion, but ultimately these principles are masks on the face of Dependency. Happiness should come from within.

If I base my happiness--or success, or mental health, etc.--on the condition of something or someone external, then I am dependent on that thing or person for my happiness. I am abdicating the responsibility, the privelege, of owning my own happiness to something other than myself. That should not be what we deem as a healthy attitude, or a healthy path to happiness.

You can achieve happiness by helping/pleasing others, but it is usually short-lived and difficult to sustain. People are unpredictable. People don't always want or need help. And we all know how discomfiting that person is walking around desperately wanting to help someone, direly needing someone to receive his attention--how absent that person's identity is until he finds a recipient for his advances by whom he can establish himself as a good person, an altruistic person, a soon-to-be happy person.

Here's the cold truth: You can be happy now. You can own your powers of will, intelligence, curiosity, and awareness, and give yourself what you want or need that will make you happy. The great thing is: the journey is just as rewarding as the destination. You'll probably find that the pursuit of happiness is just as rewarding as the prize itself.
