  Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? I believe they do.
In the age of social media where everything is seen through a fliter, our grasp on reality has been morphed. We seem to expect perfection in our day to day lives. Maybe we are  being constantly conditioned by clever advertisments that sometimes edge on nefarious deception. Without even having the intention for harm sometimes ad campigns cause more harm to the consumers psyche than good.

   When something is being presented the images that correspond should be easy to understand an connect with. To constantly have clever ways to trick the audience seems disingenuous. The image and ad campign is very important for a brand. Yet the lack of self awarness of most brands is what's most troubling. One whould hope that the way we advertise could be carefully examined.

   The glossy adverts have there place. I enjoy a good advertisments that takes me out of my element, injects fantasy into a mundane product. I understand that certain products give us a sense of status or accomplishment. We all have our favorite product for whatever reason it resonates with us, sometimes through marketing sometimes just seeing the product and liking it. I feel in the insane hyper cyber space reality where we are being bombarded with advertisments we must also know the difference between fantasy and
reality.
