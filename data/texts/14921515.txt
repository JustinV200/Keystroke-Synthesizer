Have you ever noticed how products or people's personalities can often be of much lower quality than you anticipated them to be due to their outwards appearance? I have and I believe it is all done on purpose in order to trick the public as a whole. The trickery is done to either gain money or attention or power.

Politicians get fake tans hair implants and wear make up to look as healthy and upstanding as possible hwne in reality most of them are alcoholics. Japanese fruit come in high quality packages and on the outside the fruit looks impeccable but in reality it is mere fruit being sold for anywhere between ten to forty times regular retail price on that specific fruit. Then there is the casual person who may have no money in their bank account but they have luxury brand clothing on when they go out in public to give the appearance of wealth.

Unfortunately many of these tricks work and crazy people get elected to office, business deals are given to the incompetent and people are ripped off for whatever product they just purchased. Some of you may be thinking "well I like this politician" NOPE sorry that person is corrupt. Maybe you are arguing that the fruit is worth it, well spend your money and be dissapointed in your 60 dollar mago that tastes the same as the 2 dollar one from the local farmers market.

In the end people rely to much on outward appearances. Never trust a book by its cover is not a famous saying for no reason, in fact that saying is globally known specifically because of how true it rings.
