      Lets's talk about cooperation or competion in acheiving success.  Do people suceed more with cooperation or with competition?  These are going to be the two main questions that we will dive into to get an answer.  Im sure that everyone is different and so the question could be answered many of ways so let's look at the pros and cons of each so that we can come to a conclusion.
     Succeeding with cooperation, this is done by cooperating with everyone and using the skills neccesary to obtain the desired outsome.  When suceeding this way, more then one person succeeds and everyone can work together.  You build a relationship with the people that you are working with and also everyone can be assigned different things depending on what their strengths are.
     Succeeding by competition, this is done by competing with other people and winning.  This is a nice way to boost someones ego and make them feel exilerated.  You compete against someone else, you are working alone and are not able to socialize and have help from others.  While you do feel a rush by winning, it will not last long.  You are to focused on winning and not the long term success.  It is more of a short term success.
     In conclusion, I would have to say that succeeding through cooperation would be significantly better and people acheive more threw than by competition.  The long term sucess is far better then the short term success.  When you succeed long term everyone wins.  Some may argue a different answer, and I would not be able to say that they are wrong because everyone is different and what works for one person may ot work for another.  It all depends on the person.
