     Competition is in all aspects of life. Animals compete with each other for food. Plants compete with each other for space. And humans compete with each other for a myriad of things, but most importantly, money. Is competition a positive, allowing the best man to win? Or is it a negative, pushing out the little man?
     Competition among people will always be superior to cooperation amongst people. Colleagues competing with one another often encourage creativity and imagination, coming up with new ideas for the benefit of the company. It pushes employees to better themselves and better each other. Competition does not necessarily have to be aggressive. It can be just as friendly. A little banter heare and there, perhaps some ribbing. However, competition also has its flaws. In can create strife amongst employees. It can also be detrimental to the mental health of the employees.
      In conclusion, competition creates a structure where employees can set goals for themselves and reach those goals quickly. It allows employees to strive for greatness instead of settling for average. Rather than being okay with simply stamping your time card, employees feel eager to come to work, reading to walk out feeling the best of the best.
