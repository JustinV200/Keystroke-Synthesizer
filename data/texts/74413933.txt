In this modern world, competition plays an important role in all industries. Even from schooling, people tend to compete each other for attaining success. They are taught in a way that only competition leads to success. 

The real competition here is cooperation. Without cooperation one can't lead to success. Because, getting commited to one thing will never bring success unless we cooperate and stick with the plan. Thus, it is not that easy to achieve success only by competing others. 

Competition gives you something to get boosted up always. It will be fun. It gives you energy. But cooperation leads you to success. By cooperating with others, you can attain everything at the earliest. And it helps you to reach the destination straight away with no breakouts. Competition without cooperation leads to wasting of time and energy. With cooperation, we can win the competitor at ease.

Competition leads to self doubt among people when they fail at first. It creates an illusion in their mind which questions their self esteem and finally they fail themselves thinking they can't continue doing what they started. It obviously reduces their strength and confidence level. 

In order to attain success, we need cooperation not competition. Competition makes a person greedy but cooperation leads him to success.
