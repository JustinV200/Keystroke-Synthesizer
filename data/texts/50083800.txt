
  I think images and impressions have a huge effect on people.  The effect can been seen the most with packages we buy from the store.  We look too much to  the outside of a package and not enough to what is inside.

  It may be shiny or have several colors and patterns that are visually stimulating, and it usually takes away from what we were looking at in the beginning and that being the inside of the package.
We seem to loose sight of issues of trust when getting tangled up in the loos of a package and can easily become victims to a lessor product because of that.

  I think if we paid much less attention to what was outside of the package versus what the actual package is and its value to us it would be beneficial for several reasons.
We are much more likely to be taken advantage of if we are not paying attention to what brought us to the package in the first place.  The quality of the contents of the package being my most important.

  Although I must admit I am the first one to let the shiney outside package confuse me into thinking I might want the shiner package even if it hasn't proven to be the better one for me.

   So  I would have to say yes, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people and in a relativly  negative way.
