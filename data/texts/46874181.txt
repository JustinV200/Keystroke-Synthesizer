                                            WHERE IS HAPPINESS?
According to me,happiness will come from human activites.Here i mentioned is when you do good and greet thing to others, happiness automatically will come to you ,instead of if we do any sorry things or makes the guilty situation means that sin affect us and we loose all our happiness because of their tears .

                    Charley chaplin here i mention him as a great example of great happiness collecter in the world ,you can thing he made us happy but you told he was a happines collecter? yes he did not make us only happy rather than he made him happy himself  with many sacrifice and with control of emotions.

So you people should aware of this dont seek hapiness from others and out living things ,the real happiness is sleeping into you soul you must kindle your happiness doing of satisfing your soul that will make you as a greatest happy man in the world.

                   At the same time dont be foolish to others hands, you should keep your happiness without bothar of others, at the same time you do not affected by others that also important to keep your happiness with yourself ,so, finally i conclude my paragraph with greatfull to get big dreams dont waiting to get happiness from others activity and their safezone, be free ,if you want to feel real happiness you satisfy your soul,be happy always,thank you.
