        Every individual has their own way of pursing happiness. It will differ from person to person. Every person has a few dreams about their life. They focused and put in constant effort to achieve the goal. A personal goal is to give happiness without any doubt. But people are differ on this point.
        Some people have the midset that they will achieve their goal regardless of what happens. They are willing to do anything for their goals. They can go into any extreme situations. They never thought about any other things than thier goal. These kind of people struggle a lot in their process of trying to achieve thier dreams. But once they reach the goal, they will be a huge success in life. Their goal takes them to an honourable place. But that happiness was temporary. They lose a lot in their process of achieving their goals. That will never comeback. They felt some kind of emptiness in their lives.
         Some other kinds of people also want to achieve their goals. But the difference between both of them is the way of process. These kind of people enjoy the process. They did not prioritise their own goals, rather than they will try to please every important person in thier life. This is the permanent happiness. Everyone have to enjoy the process of achieving thier goals and help to others happiness.
