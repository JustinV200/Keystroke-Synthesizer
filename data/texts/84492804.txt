Yes images and impressions have a great amount of effect on people. Most of the marketing industry runs by the popularity of the advertisers and by making memerable ads. As much it has its posive impacts on socity it can also be equally distructive and negative impacts can cost much for lot of people.

Advertisement are important in our current socity. We like to buy attractive thing now a days and good way to get coustomers is by creating an illution that the product or service is exclusive or glamerous. It is in a way a clever tatctics but there is a moral line in the seller's part. There is a very slime line between ripping some one off and efficient marketing.

Some of the worst part of advertising world is they creat this really high standard of life style which most of the people run behind but never can achive. Role of reality stars and public figure plays a big role in this. Most of the celebrities sign brand deal without fully reasearching the brands and by their infulence the brands have an opertunity to rip off people.

People most of the times buy productes just because their beloved entertainers or politicians support it. Some of the times it leaves the person with massive debts that could be avoided.
So there is responsibility for all the three side of the market now a days.

One of the seller to be reasonable and make sure they are marketing their product rightfully. and second is of the public figure who advertise the product that they are indeed telling the truth when they advertise. Third responsiblity is to the consumers which is us that we should check that the product is needed and affordable for us.
