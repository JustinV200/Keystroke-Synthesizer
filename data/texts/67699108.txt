COmpeititon is the law of nature is something a lot of people tend to live by. Competitoon breeds innovation, competition makes people push themselves hard, but maybe competition isn't best for everyone. In my opinion, cooperating tends to lead us to better restults in many areas in life and the more we cooperate and work together, the better off we can all be.

Cooperating towards a common goal can lead us into better and more ideal circumstances in most groups we may consider ourselves to be apart of. On a small scale, like a team at work, if you cooperate on a project, you can pool the skills of various different people and create a product or a result that is better than what one individual could have come up. The skills of each individual member can fill in the gaps another member may have, ensuring there are no weak points. On an even larger scale, such a global scale, if countries work togethger for  a common goal, we can achieve so much. For instance, take global warming and climate change. One country can do whatever they want to try to better the planet, but if other nations do not follow suit or cooperate, then everything that one country is doing will be more or less be totally counteracted by the inaction of the other nations. However, if we work together, we can solve the problem by utilizing the same methods.

Conversely, in certian spaces, specifically tech, competition can be better for success. If all tech firms did the same thing, we would never get technological advancements in the ways that we do. Competing with each other forces other companies to adapt and innovate on their products, which is better for consumers in the long run. 

So ultimnately, competition can be good us and can achieve some great successes, that is limited to only certain aspects of life. Only through cooperation on a large scale can we really achieve successes that will benefit all of us.
