          There is a popular saying or proverb called, "All that glitters are not gold." As per the saying, we people get attracted to everything we see without considering the reality and the ground truth behind the image, character or anything. We simply believe what is shown before us, what we get to see infront of our eyes, without analyzing the truth or background of the story behind that.
          In Social media, we get to see thousands and thousands of posts, images and videos which we tend to believe it as true and come to a judgement that this is true and this is false without proper knowledge. But in reality, people post those videos and images for likes and fame, and almost they are scripted by the way.
           That doesn't mean, we should not believe everything we see and hear. There should be proper analysis and examination before we keep our trust and belief on something. There should be a proper weighing scale between what is reality and what is fictional. The problem of current generation is confusing between these two areas. Bringing fictional things to reality and reality to fictional is impossible and therefore we end ourselves in trouble.
            To give this a solution, we should not believe everything straight away as soon as we see or hear something. So, we should not jump into one conclusion without proper investigation. Each one of us has our own eyes, ears, mouth and brain to see, to hear, to speak,to think and react. Hence, Think and React before stepping on to conclusion.
