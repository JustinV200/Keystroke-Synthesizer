The persuit of happiness. What does it take for one to be happy in life? Is it how much money you make? How many places you have traveled? How willing you are to help people? Everyone has their own beliefs in what it takes to be happy in life, there is no right or wrong. But, I believe there should be an equal balance between one focusing on their own personal goals and with being focused on the happiness of others.
I believe that we all, as individuals, have our own goals in what we want to acheive in life. We should push ourselves to become better, constantly growing and to reach those goals. Once those goals are acheived we would then be satisfied and happy that we grew and expanded our lives and pushed to acheieve what we truly wanted in life. And once those personal goals are acheived, we could always make new goals to reach for. Always striving to better ourselves. But, at the same time we should see the world as a whole and realize that we are dependant on others around us so we should also focus on helping the people in our lives be happy. People say "Birds of a feather, flock together" or "misery loves company".  There are many other saying such as these that show that who you surround yourself with can rub off on you and your attitude. If you're happy, you'll want to be around generally happy people. So, if you truly care about people in your life, why wouldn't you want to see them happy? And if there is anything you can do to help them reach their goals, then you should be there to support them in any way you possiblt can. 
So all in all, I believe that people should both focus on their own goals in persuit of their happiness, but also be there for the people in their lives that they love and care about. Those people then, in return, will be there to help you reach your goals in life and do what it takes for you to also be happy.
