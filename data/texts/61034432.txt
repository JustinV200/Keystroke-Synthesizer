If aliens invaded, would they destroy us because of our materialism?

Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic, and the aliens should allow us to live our materialistic lives.  Materialism is key to being human, and it is key to being alien as well.  In fact, it is only through materialism that the aliens can arrive to judge us.  Without the collection and assembly of resources, aliens would not have reached us before we blow ourselves up with nuclear weapons.

If we were not materialistic, the aliens would judge us as very different from themselves, chop us up, and use us as croutons on their alien salads.  Materialism is a sign of intelligence, and the driving force for progresss.  Who in their right mind, other than a defective alien race, would do something for nothing, day in and day out?  Stupid one cell organisms, who don't even know how to recognize a strand of DNA?

I myself am a materialist, and quite proud of it.  By spending 18 hours a day slaving over MTURK in my decrepid home shared by 27 feline devils, I'm able to earn 63 cents (which can provide me with a small bowl of porridge to fill my empty stomach, or possibly a dented can of Fancy Feast).

I would like to live a long and desparate life, and not be a crouton whose crumbs will be flossed out of alien teeth.  Only through materialism can this fate be avoided.
