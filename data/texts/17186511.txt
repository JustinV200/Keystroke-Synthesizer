In the world there are two types of people one type is focus on there own goals and make his and there sourunding happy and the another type is make others happy by giving or any other way by sharing there thoughts or money anything else

when you focus on your personal goals you will not familer to anyone just you known by your sourending only. in a meanwhile when you like for others happiness you will get actraction by others wecan get help from others for example we take mother treasa when she start to help others she get that happiness by by others.when you target on your personal goal means you will not get these kind of inner happy .
      when you find happyness from others its like fullfillthere dreams and make others happy to feel there happy.in a mean while personal goal happiness its always change when you reach the goal means with in a few days your goal will change then you rum for your next goal .in the happiness of others there is no goal change its ther dream to make others happy by anyway on my point of view happyness of others is always best then personal goal happiness .so that happiness comes when people focus on happiness of others is always best.
