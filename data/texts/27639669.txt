"Does this picture make me look  fat?", is a common question I hear from my friends. Before posting a picture of themselves on social media, they scrutinize every inch of it. It is because of events like this that I do believe images and impressions from the media today has too much of an effect on people.

The creation of photo shopping apps is an example of how images are effecting our society. People see their favorite actors, actresses, influencers, and musicians on the front page of magazines looking nearly perfect. Social media sites like Instagram highlight accounts of those with perfect bodies and faces. Seeing these people look so perfect makes ordinary people feel the need to look a certain way as well. Apps like Facetune and Photo Shop have skyrocketed in popularity because of people feeling the pressure to look like the perfect faces they see online.

The increase in normalizing plastic surgery is a great example of how images and impressions effect people. There was a time when plastic surgery was kept quiet and it was embarassing if people found out. Now, getting a nose job or breast augmentation is no big deal. People have become influenced to look like their favorite celebrities or influencers they see in images. When photo shopping is not enough, plastic surgery is a great option.

In conclusion, there are many examples in our society of things that have become normalized thanks to the pressures of imags in media. People feel the need to look a certain way, whether it is just for photos or for real life. The demand for filters, photo shopping apps and plastic surgery prove how vain our soceity has become. So the next time one of my friends asks me, "Does this picture make me look fat?", I can kindly remind them there is an app to help them achieve their ideal weight.
