Normally, people are so used to please someone else that we/they forget our/themselves, sadly this has become a normal and "necessary" thing in society, because if you don't feel that way and act for the happiness of other then everyone can see you as selfish and not considerate at all. 

Personally, I believe that in order to be way more happy, one should care more about your own happiness and focus on your goals, make your own decisions and face your own problems, before you can help anybody you must be at peace with yourself and in order to do that, you need to hug yourself and understand that putting yourself first is not selfish at all, we need to care for ourselves and heal what needs to be healed in order to be stable and look forward to other's happiness. 

Ultimately, this is a great point of meditation and surely is one subject we should dedicate enough time to make right what's been wrong for social pressure, we do not live in this world to get someone else's approval, we are here to figure out the meaning of life but life does not have just one purpose, life has different purposes and meanings for everyone, and maybe your purpose is to be happy and by focusing on other's happiness, you're missing your own path...

I don't think people has found the right time nor place in this life to develop a sense of belonging to themselves, so instead of growing up to hug ourselves, we prefer to fit somewhere else and change our own life in order to be part of something because we are group creatures and not have that sense of belonging sure drags us apart from our own happiness, that's the reason why a lot of people find their "happiness" through satisfying others, they are just receiving a placebo that gives them a temporary sense of peace, but if we only thought about being happy for ourselvesm we would have total peace all the time, and we would be able to help many other, this is also the problem of humanity, navity has made us so blind that we cannot take the right steps to have a future and evolve, go beyond and succeed.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read, I enjoyed expressing myself through these letters and sharing my mind with everyone.
