     Where does true happiness come from? Some believe it is achieved though one's own actions, doing what makes them happy. Others believe it is achieved though kind acts. I believe true happines comes from giving ones self to others. This may be in the form of being genorous or using one's time to help another.
     I believe true happiness is achieved through helping others because of my own life experiences and watching how happy other people who help others are. For example, many people love Christmas because they love to give gifts to their friends and families. It makes them feel good to see something they have done make their friends and family happy. I enjoy being able to help someone out when I can. Sometimes I pay for the person behind me in line or donate to a cause. Just doing small, kind acts can make a big difference in someone's life. 
     Some might say people are more happy that do things that make them happy, but I believe people are more happy when they know that there is someone that cares. Deep down I think a person would be happier having someone do a kind gesture for them than buying something nice for themselves. Because at the end of the day, I think people just want to feel connected. This is why I believe true happiness comes from helping others.
