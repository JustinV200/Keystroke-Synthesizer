     From a lame man's view, being materialistic is having much material things with no respect to the qualities but quantity.
     Modern society should only be criticized for being materialistic once it fails to tend to the needs of its people. Being materialistic gives most people happiness and joy and there shouldn't be any reason to be criticized for being happy and joyous.
     Possession of material things make the society look good and uptodate at large. All money being worked for can not be spent on food and things to drink only. One has to get those things for people to know how well off you are. They have to see and know how well you are living and you have to make yourself happy and comfortable.
     Some people do not really change after spending lots of money on the food they eat but the the possession of material things, you will get to know how of high status they are. With material things, we are able to differentiate celebrities from ordinary citizens. And material things also help in developing and growing a society. Come to think of it when a society has no other means of transportation other tahn a camel compare to a society where the youngest is driving the latest car, building masnsion and so on. Even if the road to such society is bad, possession of these material things will prompt them to see to such needs of the society hereby developing and growing the society.
    With these said, possession of material things should not be criticized so far the needs of the people of the society are met.
     Though no matter how good something is, those who will criticize it will surely do. But something we must know is that being maerialistic in modern society can never be avoided. What made modern society modern if not the possession of materialistic things, spending more money than before, acquiring assets, doing giveaways, giving to charities and spending at one's free will without the fear of being arrested or curbed.
