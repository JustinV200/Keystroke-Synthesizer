I think most of people who dont like materialist people are poor people, and i mean it both in fanantial way and emotionly. I think that there is nothing wrong to buy items or experiences that can make you feel good. 
One thing came to my mind right now,  I love buying little present for my partner. First of all it makes her super happy at the moment and the most important she always thinks of me whenever she nuses it. I love buhing her jewelary and expensive shoes and purses... why.. because every time she gets complements about it it makes mher feel god and most importantly she thinks about what a great guy I am haha. Than another thing - take your significant other to a play, cooking class, expensive restaurant- money well spend. She still brags about Hamilton play. 
I don't really understand people who buy art and decorthir houses like they are on MTV cribs. I asked so many of my friends about what the hell they were thinking doing that and the answer was oh everybody famous has it. I don't get it but i guess it makes them happy to look hip and cool. 
Another thing about materialist is that if you are smart it is a good investment. Kinda contridicts my point about buying art because if you buy great art of upcomming artist you might hit a jackpot.
So i think that if you can afford it and it brings you and people arround you joy - get it. Don't become a horderer though. Moderation is the key. If you feel the need to buy something super extravanant sleep on it and make sure that you still want it tomorrow. Or atleast make sure to keep a receipt. I also think that buying things that you can leave your children or loved ones later on is a smart decision. In this way it makes you happy and will bring your loved ones joy in the future and you will beremembered.
