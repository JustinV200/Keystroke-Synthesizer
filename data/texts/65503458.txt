First of all, happiness is not only a word its an emotion among people. Happiness lies among people who depends on their own or may be depends on others. In my point of view, people are more likely to be happy if they focus in their personal goals.
Why because, Some people have to focus on their personal goal to acheive to fulfill the people who depends them. If one will continuosly concentrate the mind and body to achieve what they want to be and they will definitely achieve the goal and thenonly they can focus on their own circle. If it happens, he will be happy. After that, he will satisfy their own people.
I believe that satisfaction and happiness comes from the achievement of own goal is more important than from other. On the other hand, Humanity is also a vital one. If one person can able to help others, who is financially poor and cannot able to satisfy their daily needs, you can definitely help them with your wealth. Not Everyone in this world depends on others. But few people do. So everyone can get happiness from helping others who is financially dependent. Aiming on others happiness is also a good one. I agree with them. Generally, a man should focus on his personal dream to get his happiness and also others.
