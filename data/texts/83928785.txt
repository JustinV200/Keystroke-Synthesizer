True happiness is something that many of us seek to find in our lives. But what is happiness and what does it mean to be truly happy? Does the pursuit of our own dreams lead to happiness or are we more likely to find happiness when we focus on the collective goals of others? This is a difficult question and one without an easy answer. 

I believe that the answer is both and that it comes down to the individual. For some of us, our personalities tend to be focused on the greater good. How can we be happy if those around us are suffering? How can I be happy as a mother if one of my children isn't doing well? How can I enjoy success when my neighbors are struggling? 

I speak from personal experience and my own personality in that I have found happiness and gratitude in being of service to others. I find my own happiness in seeing others do well. However, I realize that this argument for happiness is based entirely on my own unique personality. While there are others like me, it would be ignorant to say that everyone feels the way I do.

I know many people who are very driven. They have worked hard, made sacrifices, and are very successful both financially and in the business world. Many of these people are very generous with giving to charitable causes, but their happiness is not tied to the happiness of others. Satisfaction and happiness has come from reaching their goals and again, this is based on their own unique personalities.

In summary, I feel that some people are likely to be happy focusing on their personal goals and some people are likely to be happy when focusing on the happiness of others. I believe it is based on personality and life circumstances. And what a boring world this would be if we all had the same personality!
