There is always a saying" First impression is the best impression" . Now-a days people are often worried what others think about them. So they want to build an acceptable and interesting social image about themselves. People are happy when they are perceivesd as competent, moral and desirable.
Sometimes we try to create an  impression by saying or creating something but others perceive it in other way . In this situation it is better to remain silent. Impression or images are not the important factors. I does not determines our behavior. Only our actions that reflect our thought and decide what type of person we are. Only our true values will prove us to this world.
But on the other side think what happens if people don't bother about images? They  will stop grooming or cleaning themselves. They will become very rude and won' t be polite or kind to others.
