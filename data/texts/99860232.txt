On an indvidual basis, people should be criticized for engaging in overly materialistic/consumeristic behavior. It is plain to see that those living in wealthy, developed countries have been incentivized to act in this way and the example they've set has caused great damage to subsequent generations. Interpersonal relationships, community involvement, and general mental health have all been degraded by this worldview. It is incumbent upon all of us to "act locally, think globally" in regards to this issue. We must call out those who are the most egregious examples of this behavior and, in our own actions, endeavour to embody a more righteous way of living.

Young people, consciously or not, look to their predecessors for guidance on how to behave. In modern developed nations they see a venal and narcissistic class of people being consistently rewarded, while virtuous qualities such as cooperation and solidarity are disregarded. The more this culture is amplified and reproduced, the worse off the situation gets. We can often feel as though these larger issues are out of our hands, but in fact they are not. Rather than giving up and surrendering to this tide, now more than ever we should stand up against it and oppose it through our words and deeds.

It is our responsibility to both our society and species to combat materialistic consumerism. We are here to "keep the party going" so to speak, and the fetishistic idolatry of mammon and luxury is a direct threat to that struggle. We need to call this nonsense out more and more, for real, and establish a new kind of standard. I mean it's really starting to get out of hand.
