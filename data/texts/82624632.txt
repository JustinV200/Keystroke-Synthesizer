     Yes, materialism should be critized in modern society because individuals have become self absorbed in material items or beauty.  People should not hold value or become obsessed with material items or beauty; i.e. comparing your luxery items over another person, and letting that item hold true to your self worth.  People have a tendency to look at what others have, rather then looking at what they can do for another person.  Instead, people should  hold the true value of someone by their character, rather than what they have, how much something cost, and what someone looks like.

     Our society is focused on the next person or the wealth of that person.  They would rather go broke to be someone they are not.  For example, John has bought a houseboat with twin turbo engines, two story high, marble floors, and etc; Mike the next door neighbor will go out and purchase a houseboat with extras twin turbo engines, two story high with a roof top deck and attached sliding board, and etc.  It is more than keeping up with the Joness but rather, keeping up with materialistic things to out-better the other person.  The material value has over compensated how we look at our wants and needs.  

     Materialistic individuals rather focus on how much something cost and that cost may out-weight their actual income.  They would rather spend more on items and break their bank account to achieve higher standards in living.  Individuals who look at value with materials are usually not the happiest individuals internally.  Externally, they seem like they have it all; from wealth to physical appearance, but deep down inside, they are missing something that truely makes them happy.  When we become obsessed with items or beauty, we loss value in who we are.
