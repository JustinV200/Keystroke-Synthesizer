          When it comes to criticizing modern society for being materialistic, there are many factors that need to be considered, the main factor being social status. First off, it is very easy to see how different social classes could have very different view of materialism. Someone from a lower working-class society could feel that an expensive car is materialistic where as someone from a higher class simply sees it as a necessity. In this situation, if a working-class person was to embellish and buy the expensive car, he may be considered materialistic and superficial among his equal peers.

           I do not feel that people should be criticized for living the way that they would like to live. The idea of purchasing items to "keep up with the Joneses" could be the motivation that some people need to push themselves every day. Even though I don't feel people should be criticized for thier motivation, I do not agree with it. I feel that having a "I must have the best of the best" mindset can only lead to feelings of never being satisfied. When people start to feel this way, they can end up with feelings of emptiness and depression. Some may deny that this will happen, but it has been proven true many times.

         Although I feel that each person should live their lives the way they see fit, it is important that we are there for our friends and family to try and help them see that constantly chasing the next best thing may not be a healthy way to live. That we should try and remeber that the things that bring value in life, are the things that can not be measured by how much they cost, that the valuable things in life are usually free.
