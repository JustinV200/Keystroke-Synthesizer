First let us know What is Materialism?  Materialism is giving much importance to money and wants to possess a lot of material things. Now let us discuss should moden society be criticized for being materialistic?
According to me materialism should be criticized because now-a-days people are spending money on unreasonable and unnecessarily things just for the sake of doing. People are not aware of the "want" and "need".They don't know the difference between the want and the need? Now-a days windowshopping has become very common among people. They do this all for the sake of fun and leisure. 
On the other hand materialism also has some positive effect also .It contributes to the personal fulfillment and betterment of society. It also gives the opportunity to always have the latest things. Materialism makes us fulfilled, connected and happy. On the other hand it also has some negative effects also . Many studies have found that people with high levels of materialism have less positive emotions, high level of depression and anxiety. 
There is no doubt we all live in a materialistic world. Without this it is somewhat impossible to survive. Now we all have a doubt that how to handle this? There is a limit to everything in this world . We all should know the difference between the want and the need ? There  is more thing to value in this  universe. So do the things for the purpose.
