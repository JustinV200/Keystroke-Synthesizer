I truly do believe there is too much emphasis on impressions of people and social media. It's become a home for bullying. Not everyone can make a positive impression - you may be having an off day, may be sick, or possibly tired. Should you be judged for that one time you made an off impression? No. 

But social media will do that. They villify and single out people for the wrong dress code, a funny look, or an off remark statement. This has caused many a person and celebrity to be "cancelled" or "memed". The emphasis on looks and clothing is way too much these days, and needs to be addressed. The stigma of looks has caused so many people to become bullied, feel bullied, and end up committing suicide. Suicides have increased among four key age groups since 2011 - between 2011 and 2020, especially among young men.

It could be stated that this timeframe was when social media had come onto the scene and started. The advent of influencers and the like have caused many people to feel down on themselves, to feel less than, which has driven depression and suicide rates among teens. These teens feel they need to mimic and emulate their favorite influencers and entertainers, which simply may not be possible. Advertisements make things seem and look easy - but the reality of it is, these "influencers" and "entertainers" have a direct pass to this lifestyle, one that most of us simply never will.
