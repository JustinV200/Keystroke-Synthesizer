In corporate America, the drive to be the best and to climb the ladder is evident. Coworkers are constantly competeing over who will get the promotion, who will be the to preformer. It starts in school, competing over class rank, GPA, and who is working the hardest. Working together and coorperation, can lead to more success and bringing people together instead of staging them against each other. 

Cutting others down doesn't raise you up. When people come together and work towards a common goal, they can be more productive, and more creative. If one coworker, suggests and idea it can give someone else another idea and snowball from there. As the new generations are coming into the workforce it's creating a shift from super competive to be more team orieneted and collaborative.

Some companies are changing their methods and are encorgaging group working. Adding open tables for workstations and lounge areas instead of cubicals and are some ways they are enabling employees to come together rather than working in isolation. Special days for team bonding and team building are also ways compaines are bringing team closers. 

In conclusion, collabration will achieve more succuess than competition. Some companies are starting to reliaze this and are changing their methods, but will the mega competitors be able to conform to work with others? Or will they cause problems is the workplace?
