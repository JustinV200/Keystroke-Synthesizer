We  can not trust our eyes always. Things are not always as they appear. We may think something is a certain way but in reality that is not what exactly we think.  In advertising company they using these strategy for their business. They make their product amazingly to look but its content  looks very small. So we automatically attracted to its appearance. Its not only suitable for products also it will suitable for all things and peoples.

And in medid field we can see many celebraties and public figures. We can see only their appearance but we actually do not know the real them. We can easily judge them when they present outside just looking at their appearance and behavior. But who knows their action and behavior all are already planned. They make their action just to get attention from people. But we do not know anything abouy that we just like them follow thwm and criticize them without knowing reality.

Now a days people focus their eyes on fake. They do not mind about reality they just believe what they see and hear. But in reality behind everything they see there is another story the real one. Some people know about the fact eventhough they just want to follow everyone and do not make any changes about reality. Everyone accepting the fake world and moving on.
