They say you should not judge a book by its cover.  We do this all the time, however.   Even as children, we assumed the cereal in the brightly-colored box with fun characters on it would be tasty.  As adults, we see what people post on FaceBook and assume it's a fair representation of their lives.  On both counts, we're wrong.

First impressions are often misleading.  People often put their best face forward.  People show the world what they want others to see.  We should not assume those first glimpses tell the whole story, but that's often what we do.

Just like cereal manufacturers design packaging to make their food appear tastier and more nutritious than it actually is, entertainers, politicians, and other public figures dress and talk and present themselves in such a way that they may make themselves appear smarter, more talented, richer, or more important than they really are.  Some actually hire public relations consultants or experts in creating a brand to help them do this.

If we want to know what lies within the package, we need to read the label.  If we want to know the real abilities and character of public figures, we need to watch what they do and how they behave.  We need to pay attention to how they treat others and the things on which they spend their money.  Only then can we form a real, meaningful impression of something or something.
