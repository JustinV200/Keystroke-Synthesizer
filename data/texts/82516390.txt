Have you noticed that everywhere you look there are blaring images and flashing sounds or did I mean blaring sounds and flashing images? Either way, the world is full of noises and chaos, all demanding you turn your attention to the newest advertising. The newest gadget, the latest trend, the freshest fashion, the coolest cars, or what have you. Yet, they seem to work, more money is spent on these things. 

Advertisers have figured out that blaring and flashing gets people to turn and pay attention, to fork over hard earned cash and buy the latest thing. However, the wear and tear comes not from the checkbook (though that does hurt) the real damage is done to the soul. Our lives weren't meant to be shouted at constantly, our weary hearts wasn't meant to absorb so much noise. We are lost in a sea of discontent and of ever increasing anxiety. Why? Because the noise is too much and the allure of the next thing keeps us weary and drained. We never can be the poster children, we never can be the TV models, we will always be ourselves and adverstising has told us, that is not enough. We need help, we need hope, we need a new solution. 

Maybe we should slow down. Maybe we need a reset. Maybe we need the forest, the ocean, the wind in our hair, the sun on our backs. Maybe what we really need is not more, it's less. We need a break, we need a rest, we need to disconnect. Not in the sense of escaping or a vacation but a hardwire, soul saving reset. We need contentment and peace. Even if we just had one day a week in which we could just unplug from it all, tell ourselves to slow down, rest, and recharge. This would do the world a whole lot of good and our souls even moreso. 

The images and impressions may not do much in terms of specific sales but they do something towards our over-all desire for more. It does something for our overall discontent and this is the problem.
