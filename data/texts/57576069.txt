MAN MADE MATERIALISM

The Topic Materialism is referring to the possession of valuable show-off objects which People do not really need at that point of their lives.They begin to buy costly things for the purpose of show-off which everyone has atleast donce once in their lives. Not the modern society and the upcoming generations are to be blamed for this because coporates have created this urge of materializing object and portray them as standard or status in the society.A study in The United States of America has reported that materialism has been ruining People's Relationship  and makes a person feel relatively less satisfied with themselves.

For Example A leading Fruit Named Technological company has made it products to be materialistic and has created a scenario that people with possessions of their company products are little a bit higher standard whereas everyone else are a bit lower in their standards 

Only the Modern Society could  not be blamed for this because coporates have virtually deployed their marketing strategies into someone (almost everyone with the materialistic) minds and have been making things happen around the world. So the criticizism should not only be against the modern society rather than it should be against all the people who made possessions to look as a criteria to be filled or satisfied rather than his or her own needs and satisfactory levels and approach of towards life.
