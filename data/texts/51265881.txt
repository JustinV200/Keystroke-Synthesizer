  Everyone is materialistic in some sense, they need things to survive, shelter, clothing, food and water. It all depends on the luxuries or "the wants" of the person and how influential they are on their mental wellbeing and value of status. I think modern society should be criticized to some degree for being too materialistic because of how heavy handed our capitalism is engrained in us. Social media is a vehicle for material goods and services that are most of the time fake, embellished or an outright scam. 
  I think if we went back to a barter system it would help civilized society a lot. We all have value in our skills and experiences and those should be prioritized over our physicial body and socioeconomical status. I think the influencer genre has ruined honest reviews since people are basically bribed with product to make good content for a product that otherwise might not be worth it.
  Too many celebrities make a cash grab by releasing sub par skin care and make up lines that are the same as other brands with a new label put on and with a much higher price tag and short supply so it sells out on purpose
