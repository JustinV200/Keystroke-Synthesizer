Materialism is something normal and inherent to the human being, since we work so hard in order to spend whatwe have and that makes us happy or at least takes away a little bit of the stress we have from life.

At the same time, it is understand that people can feel better about themselves by spending what they want or having properties, because socially that translates into economic health and sucess. As human being are so sociable we like to be seen as a succesful person and this is the easiestway to achieve that social approval. Many times also by the very nature of humans, we can fall into the mistake of thinking that we are better than others because we have more money or more properties, being of a higher social status.

Historically, there has always been a fight to have more than other. You must have a balance between materialism and a full spiritual life so as not to alienate other people from our social circle because of our lifestyle, not to be selfish or believe that is the most important thing, since the most important thing is that even having everything what we have to continue being a correct personwho does not think he is better than others.
