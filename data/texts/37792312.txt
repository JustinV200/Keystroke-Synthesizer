  Each human i believe is built with their own individual thoughts and so what makes one happy isnt necessary guaranteed to make another happy.Some people laugh at jokes while some have rather dry senses of humors.Some find love stories to be sad and cry the whole movie through.Others are untouched by the same exact story.
 
   This supports my belief for saying that some people are made happy by others happiness and good fortunes even when their own arent in good shape,These type of people seem to put the needs of others before their own.no matter what they would rather do for snother rather than to do for themselves.Other people are totally opposite and they care about nothing except for themsekves.It doesnt matter the worsest situation they would rather themselves to benefit or profit before the poorest person .These perople are known as greey and have no empathy for anyone other than themselves.They can even be your mother,father sister or your own brother.

   I believe in finding my happiness through myself first and then through the empathy i have for thy neighbor.it doesnt matter if i have everything as as i have what i need then i am always rooting for the nex
