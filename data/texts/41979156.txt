What is sucess:
   In life there are so many person do not know about what is success.  They assume that be a winner and the students be like be a topper in the class, and also dome of the workers, Managers, other workers did not really know about the single word is called success.  

   Success from the societies point of view is like ear more money.  But in my point of view about success is sharing and caring others and also to be useful to others especially those who need help.  God should create people for help each other in this society.

    Somehow success is not what you gain but also success is about what you give to other or your loved ones honestly.  There are so many good things will happen when we are in honest state.  Being happiness is the greatest success thing.  That is why I am happy today.  I need money but I do not need a lot of money.  Some people really don't understand about the other side of money.  This is how we are good being help to others.  Getting success in a good competition is always a healthy competition of law.  We should enjoy with what we had.

     The way of being success is making others happy and support others.  We should also a good friend of at least one person in our life.
