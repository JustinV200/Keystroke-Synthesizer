     First of all " The best things in the life are not things ".   Telling people to be less or not materialistic is like telling people that they shold not enjoy or eat fatty foods . In the practical world many peoples just learn to control their desires and not to removing the underlying desires. This is one of the flow of the society we are living in.

      The society we are living in just wanting us to live luxury and it works we live in a place that only if we continues to spend . Our society places more value on how much we have on our own and also materialism than on acheivements and people ourselves. But most of the people are here are so much materialistic.

      But as my view things are created to be used nso that people will do anything to hang on to them . but people they are beautiful human being they are born to love and meant to be loved . But people in the society were circled in the things and also in the confusion.  So please clear in the point " Things were replaceable, but people aren't ". So please concentrate on people more than things in this modern world. 

Being in or out of modern society its upto to the people's mind we are not able to blame the society. Thank you for giving me the time for expressing my thoughts. Have a great day and beautiful life.
