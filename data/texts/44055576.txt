  The question is whether or not competition or cooperation will garner more success.

 Well, I believe in both, and it will simply depend on the ultimate goal. Are you looking to acquire great wealth? Competing, and outsmarting your competitor will accomplish this. If  you are looking to help your fellow humans, cooperation is key here. We all need to communicate with each other, establish needs and abilities, a give and take is the only way to create a decent world.
 In the business world where you are trying to promote yourself, make a good living and still have the respect of others you will need a combination of both. Yes, you must be a fierce competitor to gain that sought after job, that does not mean you tromp on everyone in your way. A helping hand offered and / or accepted will strengthen any desire for respected leadership. Establish the job sought, recognize the potential adversaries, set your plan in motion; compete! Allow your talent to shine, ask advice, recognize that qualities of others and accepting you are both needed to make any job a success; cooperate.
 In daily life without healthy competition, we stagnate. Without cooperation? We are dead in the water.  
Don't you enjoy your beautiful garden? How about your neighbor's? A good basketball game?  Simple things.
Smile and push forward, hand in hand!      Success!
