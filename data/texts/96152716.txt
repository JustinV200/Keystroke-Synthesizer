    Really, I need this new outfit. I also need these new shoes. I want this new couch. I want to change the style of decor in my house. I want, I want, I want. This is something I know we all say to ourselves each and every day. We are always thinking it whether it be something as simple as a coffee or as big as maybe buying a new home. Materialism can be found anywhere and everywhere.
    Today our lives revolve around it whether some of us want to admit it or not. I like to think that I'm not materialistic but I know if I didn't have some of the things that I have I wouldn't be very happy. There are times I want to just go blow money on stupid things because I feel like I need them but in reality I just want them because I like them or I saw someone else having them. I have been told that if I could just be happy with the things I have then I wouldn't get so down about the things I don't. This is not true in my eyes. 
   Everywhere we look we are inundated with images of beauty and things we are told we need to have and that makes it hard not to always want something. Getting new things makes me happy and if I have the money and can afford to buy the things I want then that's what I will do. My happiness is my own. 
   So if you are considered to be materialistic so what. If you buying things makes you happy then by all means do it. Its your happiness not theres.
