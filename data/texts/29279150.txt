In today's society, money and goods are the most prized possessions.  Go to any public sppace, and you will see fancy cars and trucks, people dressed in fashionbable clothes, and people eating expensive food.  Fancy houses, luxury vacations and curated experienes are ever present in this country. We consider this to be normal and most people cannot imagine any other way.

However, this does not have to be the way of the future. Society can change in the future just as it has changed in the past.  For example, Inca society in Bolivia and Peru was just the opposite of what we see today.  In that society, everyone was given a job producing food, goods, or services and the result of their labor was stored and then distributed to every person in the society.  Everyone shared in all of the things that they produced.  

Today this seems like a silly idea to us.Some would call it socialism.  But if you examine the buildings and roads they left behind, they are some of the most fantastically produced specimens on the planet.  The alpace wool they produced for clothes was and is still the highest quality and most expensive wool available today.  The agricultural terraces and walls were built to withstand earthquakes and are still standing 600 years later, when most of the buildings we have built during that time seldom last more than 100 years.

Our society today could learn alot from this past Inca society and the things they produced.  While the modern concept is that oure way of doing things is the best possible and most efficient way of operating, that is a false perception.  The fact is unless we are willing to change and try a new system then nothing ever will change and we will be married to our current system whether it is the best or not.  The abilty to change starts in our minds and then flows to our hands and then to our society.
