     Yes, I think people are very happy when they prove their self or achive something and shows their level to others that will make them very happy. A person without aim may not get interest in life this is my oppinion. Each one in this world have a dream or aim but it was undesirable but when they get succeed to their aims they become happy. When we see a person who achieve something will share his or her happiness with others make everyone happy. 
     We can see lot of peoples are trying hard to prove them self but If they fail because of their situation wiil make them a unsuccessful person in the society. But thier family members are other persons who are welwisher of his or her will make them happy with thier possitive support. That will make them to get focus on thier goals.
     I think Happiness of their own are long term happiness whenever they remember the situation that will make them happy but If they happy because of others will not give a long term happiness like that. I will happy whenever I see others happiness but I think that will not give a satifaction to me.
