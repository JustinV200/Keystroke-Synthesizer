Yes image and expression have too much effect on people.speaking in words have less effect than looking an content in image.it stores in people's minds.An image will attracts even common people.in my point of view eyes speaks lot more than speaking.Expressing our feeling in words is less effective than writing a letter.our loved one will remember every thing by seeing our images.Even if we think about our childhood days we cannot remember anything but if we look our photographs took in our past will make us remember everthing of our childhood.This show that image is more effective than speaking.We cannot remember every word spoken by a person but we can remember a person by looking into their image one.Even for some people who have never seen their parents,like whose parents died in their childhood has an advantage to look at them by a photograph of parent.Indeed picture and articulation affect people.Speking in words have less impact than looking a substance.in any event,for certain individuals who have never seen their folks,similar to whose guardians kicked the bucket in their young life enjoys a benefit to check out at them by a photo of their parent. we can't recall each word expressed by an individual yet we can recollect an individual by investigating their picture once.
