           Fashion, money, cars,  the new necesseties of today. Welcome to 2022, where if you dont look it, then you dont have it. That concept has people feeling like everything they own has to be name brand or "foreign", And if they dont, then they'll be perceived as "broke". Also, some people believe if you "dont have it", as long as you look like you do everyone else will believe it. The way others see them have way too much impsct on people and their decisions.
           How many of you knows someone who spends their whole check buying the latest shoes, or expensive name brand clothes consitantly? Then the first thing they do is grab their phone to show everyone on social media, head to the mall just to "walk around". People feel a need to potray this image of wealth just to be accepted by society. 
           Images and impressions have entirely too much of an effect on people today. I feel like we should learn how to live true to ourselves, and stop worrying about what the next person has to say. You dont need a foreign 2022, or a named brand bag just to be accepted. We also need to stop judging people based off of what they have. What you own shouldnt change how anyone feels about you.
