Materialism is common in today's society. We all engage in consumer habits such as shopping especially during holidays and special events. The United States is one of the leading consumer-driven economies in the world. Even though rapid consumption culture is popular, it has many negative effects on society. 

Consumerism and materialism focus heavily on ego gratification and make our lives less meaningful. Although shopping and consumer culture may spike our dopamine levels, ultimately they fail to fulfill us in the long run. Shopping is known to be addictive and just like any addiction, its feel good chemicals are temporary. We feel more empty, depressed and continue our search to find fulfillment when the high wears off.

Also, modern society is built on the materialistic pursuit of money. Our economy is based on a capitalistic free market that allows anyone to sell consumer goods (as long as they are legal). The focus is on more and more consumption. This is harmful because it creates a cycle of dependency on external factors. We can't build healthy self-esteem while we are in this cycle. 

In conclusion, today's society heavily pushes consumerism and is too materialistic. This affects members of society negatively. We become less focused on meaningful pursuits and dependent on a never-ending chase.
