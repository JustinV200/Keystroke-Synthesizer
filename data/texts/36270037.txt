    Are we too materialistic? " Yes" would be the answer the author of this article says. I think along the same lines. 
    People seem to feel that the more things you have, the happier you will be. It seems to me that the more you have the more you want. People who have very little are happy that way. The people who have a lot sometime are not happy. They look to see what the next guy has and does whatever to have it too. What happens if you get everything there is to get and you're still not happy?
    I think if you really want something and are willing to work for it then you are entitled to it and any happiness it might bring. If you continue to buy things and don't feel any happiness about it you should give it away to someone who would really like it but can't afford to pay. 
    I've been around families who had very little money and relied on the kindness of others to get by. They always seemed so greatful for what others did for them. I've also been around families who could have anything they wanted and were not happy with any of it.
    In the end I guess it doesn't matter what you think about my stuff or what I think about yours.
