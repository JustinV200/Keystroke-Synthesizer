Most of us hear about materialism and how it's bad and ruins things like Christmas etc. Materialism can definetly be bad if you take it too far, but in general it's not really a bad thing. People need to always check themselves and make sure they are not going overboard or ever putting material first before people. 
Having possestions is a good thing and can help you live an easy and more effective life. having more types of tools can help one get the job done safer, faster, and with more quality . having several vehicles can serve as a backup if one breaks or you can lend them out to friends and family who are less forntunet then you when they need a vehicle to use. you can also do greater deeds of kindness with the more items you have by gifting them to people when you want to buy new items, giving them to the needy or have fun with your new object by using it for good.
Some arguments against buying lots of items is that you will get too sucked into the world and it's materialness but so long as you keep God and people before objects, you can enjoy buying alot of stuff and actually do good with it all too, you just need to always check your priorities and make sure that you do not ever value an object over a person or God.
