     Images and impressions in advertising presentations have a big effect on people.  In this fast-paced world, there is little time for deep reflection or consideration.  We see the effect of the "shiny object" in everything from grocery store shelves to media to politics.
     When shopping for groceries, we know that merchandisers pay more to have their products displayed at eye level. They want to capture the attention of buyers with colorful and clever packages and encourage impulsive behaviors by grabbing attention.  Buyers may not actually look for the best price or a product which satisfies their needs better, but be swayed by clever advertising.
     On television or the internet, advertisers understand that they must grab attention of viewers quickly.  The images may be shocking, fast-paced, and colorful accompanied with true or untrue sound bites which will impress viewers emotionally.  The unrelenting barrage of images and sounds meets the desire for entertainment and often precludes anaylsis by the viewer.
     In public political appearances we see the effect of imaging widely employed. A certain demographic may be arrayed behind the speaker, suggesting that many in this group offer their support.  Flags are prominently displayed, evoking an emotional patriotic response.  People in supportive gear like caps or tee-shirts are featured and signage is carefully designed to convey a specific message.  Viewers might not get an accurate impression but be swayed by emotional rhetoric enhanced with imagery.
    These are just  few exanples of how images and impressions can sway public opinion. Until people become savvy consumers, advertisers will use carefully chosen devices to effect buyers nd consumers of their products.
