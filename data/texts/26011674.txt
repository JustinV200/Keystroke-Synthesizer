     Happiness is achieved when you find satisfaction in something that you are doing.  A person can be happy under different circumstances. It depends on what is important in that moment.  If someone is family oriented and a spouse and or children are present, seeing their loved ones happy makes them happy.  Some people persue a lifetime goal of trying to be the best at everything and are only happy when those goals are met but may find it difficult to push past dissapointment and may spend time unsatisfied with themselves until the next successful moment.  In general I believe that it is personal goals that may also lead a person to focus on the happiness of others as well.

     When personal goals are met and a person finds themselves pleased with their life goals there has to be more to life than just living selfishly and it is important to do what feels right to help see the people in their lives are also doing well. It is easy to get carried away with your own career and have a family to support thus working harder to make more money. If the time is not properly shared with your loved ones the only happy person will be the one persuing the career. There has to be a balance to be happy in life the focus has to be somewhere in the middle.

     When a person finds the happines they are looking for and they have learned some lessons in life to balance their wants and needs of themselves and the people they love and cherish, a person can experience happiness. Learning a place of peace within oneself and being satisfied with what you are doing can help achieve this happiness.
