We are a very materialistic society. And I'm sure it's not only Americans. It's any country that is not a third world nation. 

We thrive on capitalism, as it takes capital to produce and sell goods. Another point is that consumerism is what keeps our economy thriving. We spend money on goods. That money is rotated to manufacturing facilities, trucking companies and retail outlets. This keeps people employed. 

And the more we spend, the more Uncle Sam gets it in revenue through sales tax and income tax from employed people. 

Sometimes we are too consumed with material things. We work harder to be able to buy things at the expense of our families. Sometimes family members would rather have quality time with their loved ones than the biggest house, newest car, or cell phones. The old adage, "money can't buy happiness" is mostly true. 

But given the choice between living large or having very little, most people would probably rather "have it all" than to live a meager lifestyle. We just cannot give up our comforts. 

Money does make the world go round and more money that is put into the economy, the better off we are. We just need to know when to slow down and take a break from buying things.

So should modern society be critized for being materialistic? That depends on your values and goals. While some people thrive on having material things other people live for adventures. But even adventures usually cost money.
