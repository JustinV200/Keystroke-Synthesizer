Materialism is something that everyone loathes. Materialism is the act of aquiring things and spending money on things that you think make you happy. Many people think that people now a days are too materalistic and do not care about things that actually matter. 

The rich and the sad are usually the worst when it comes to being materialistic. They think that buying things will make them happy, when truly they need to find out what the reason for their sadness is. Being rich helps you buy all the unnecessary items. You can't buy things when you are poor! 
Most people spend their time and money collecting more and more things that they don't need. Buying things can make you happier, for a short time. Eventually you will have a house full of items, but does any of it spark joy? Did you just buy it because you were sad? Many people will buy many things, which they eventually get rid of, just to go out and buy more useless things. 

Convience helps with buying more things. What is easier than browsing the internet when you are boared and saying" wow, thats cute" and you buy it. Next thing you know Amazon is knocking on your door with the package in 2 days or so.
Materialism, man..   

I am the worst writer ever. I failed English 9 in high school and had to take it again when I was a senior with a bunch of 9th graders. I understand why she failed me. LOL
