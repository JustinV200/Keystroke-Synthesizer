                                                           The happiness of dreams


Introduction:
     
     We are very happy when what we desire comes in our dreams whether it happens in reality or not.

position:

     The joys of dreams that have happened in my life.

Reasons and evidence:

     There are many things I want to achieve in my life. When I was in college I was very happy when I saw my friend's family. Because they have their own house which is very big and they go out once a month and are happy. We are in a rented house and we are indire financial straits. 

     I am very sad that my parents are not able to take me anywhere because I have so many longings in my heart. One day I was sleeping at night when I had a dream. I am in a very big palace. My parents fulfill all my needs and wants. We go to many tourist attractions. I am very happy in the dream even if it doesn't happen in reality.

     I shared my dreams with my parents. They were very happy to hear what I had to say and were waiting to see when this would happen. Then they were very sad to see me and were very sad that we could not do anything for you as you.

Conclusion:

     I thought not to upset my parents in any way. I studied very well and I got a good job. We bought the big house I wanted. I took my parents to that house on their wedding day as a surprise. My parents were very happy. We must always dreams. There is nothing we can't achieve if we put our minds to it. If we dream with the thought that it would be good if it happened to us without being jealous of others, We can achieve our dreams very happily. We will definitely acheve it in our life.
