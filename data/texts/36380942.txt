In modern world, competition between one people and another or one company with another results in succession and development of the particular individual person or company. Many people focus only on their self success and development rather than focusing on others. 

But competition between others alone cannot help to achieve more success. cooperation among people is much more important. In early days, in our childhood we are more exposed to harsh competition by our parents and teachers, which also helps us in achieving self development and preparing for competition in adulthood. 

But cooperation among particular people results in more lasting achievement than the individual victory. for example, people in particluar company, focusing only on their particluar target and success , results in loss of success in overall achievement of that company. In sports like soccer, where a group of 11 people must have to work unitely in order to win the match rather than performing for the self interest. conclusively, cooperation is much more important than the self succession.

Cooperation among people helps in improving their leadership skills, decision making ability, trust building among individuals and communication skills. cooperation leds to more exposure to various fields where cooperative learning is more effective than the competitive learning.
