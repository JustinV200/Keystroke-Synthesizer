Competition versus cooperation; which takes the feat over the other? Cooperation allows for a greater means to reach success as it fosters positive relationships, and a more positive working environment while competition can breed hostile work environments that ultimately do not produce successful results.

Intense competition can have the opposite impact on productivity. Fostering an environment of constant rivalry can create animosity between coworkers in which less is produced overall. Additionally, animosity between coworkers creates a negative working space in which individuals may began despising what they do regularly. The goal should be to create an environment where individuals get along with one another, thus these relationships can foster growth. 

However, it may be true limited competition can be a good motivator. You do not want individuals to be complacent where they are. Complacency does not breed growth nor is productive. So small amounts of competition can help stimulate a workplace when things are at a standstill. Again this cannot be taken too far where the competition leads to hostility amongst coworkers when pitted against one another.

All in all, cooperation and competition have a place in achieving success. However, cooperation can have a stronger pull in sucess when pitted against competition. Cooperation helps build strong relationships in which you can go to your resources for assistance to meet an end product. Competition can cause unnecessary rivalry between individuals that can limit success.
