Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic.  While on the surface, materialism may have negative connotations, it's actually a driving force behind good buisness.  Materialism drives a cyclical relationship between businesses, their employees, and their customers.  The drive to earn money, spend money, and aquire posessions drives businesses to innovate; drives employees to work harder to earn more; drives consumers to buy more.

In all aspects, we rely on materialism to survive.  Personally, I will surf Amazon regularly to buy that one gadget I just can't live without.  And I'm not the only one - our shared materialism has meant Amazon now employs over a million workers world wide.  That's a million workers that have health benefits, a retirement plan, food on the table, and clothes on their backs because I MUST HAVE the newest device that helps me put sunscreen on my wiggling toddler.

Because my customers want the goods we manufacture, I'm able to employ nearly 100 people.  Because my employees want to buy a new car, new clothes, or a new house, they come to work every day and do their best to continue to make a good wage. Materialism has a negative connotation, but, along with capitalism, is needed.

Too much of anything is a bad thing.  With materialism, if it's unchecked, there are detrimental results.  We can spend too much money, putting us into a bad situation financially, unable to pay for necessities.  We can put the focus on material goods over care and empathy for those around us.  While that is a risk we take, materialism is also necessary to continue to feed a strong economy.
