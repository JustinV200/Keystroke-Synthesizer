I'm going to share my view on materialism with you today. While I'm not a writer I, I hope I come across. In todays world and I think so much focus is on the materials we possess and the things that we are able to maintain. 

I believe that having certain materials is a status symbol and something that most people want to flaunt. People want to be seen having nice cars, nice homes, nice clothing, nice decor and so many other things. We care so much about how people view us that we can become completely consumed by this. 

I understand the urge to focus on material things, but I don't think they bring happiness, but I certainly believe they help! Having the money to buy the things you want, makes life a little more enjoyable. Having the money to pay your bills and provide for your family makes life less stressful. 

I think it's in our nature to never really be sastified with what we have. We have the urge to want more and more. We obtain something and then we want something more. I don't think people do this knowingly, but I do feel it's something everyone does. We fulfill one desire and then almost immediately will find something else that we must have. 

I don't feel that people should be criticized for being materialistic. Everyone has been at some point in time or another whether they realize it or not. Things we can buy, make us happy and make life a little easier or less stressful!
