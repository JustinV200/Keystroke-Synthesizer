No one likes to be labeled as materialistic, but in essence most are molded by sociatal values that gear toward materialism. It comes to a basic search for comfort that most have, but that comfort that comes from possessions and the means to aquire them is misguided. Hence, modern society should be criticized for its materialism. 

Materialism is rooted in selfishness and that is bound to destroy a society rather than to make it progress. Working for money, either for survival or to get rich will always appeal to base instincts. So also the greed comes into the picture as a motivating factor in most. And many ills will come from that, like theft and all kind of violence against others only to acquire desired things or the means to aquire them. 

Nevertheless, some may openly come in defense of materialism; it is increasingly not taboo. For instance, people make social experiments for laughs but what they capture is really not funny. If that means anything in this day, it can be said that people have "no soul." But materialism can also often be found in those that try to expose the materialism of others without trying to "change the world." So, materialism is endemic and the cure is really to stop the lies and the propaganda rooted in theories and let people connect with their spiritual dimension. 

The world is walking in darkness and until people can "see" that and act unpon that, there will be no change. What is evil will be lauded and what is good will be despised. And Jesus is the voice that needs to be heard and heeded in this matter�not the caricature present in most people's minds and associated with religion, but the truth.
