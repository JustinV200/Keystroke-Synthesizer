Modern society should be criticized for being so materialistic.  I feel there is too much emphasis on what we have rather than who we have in our lives.  The focus shifted from family to fortune somewhere along the way, and I feel it is important to shift that focus back to family and working together as a society.

We, as a society, put an extreme amount of pressure on ourselves and others to measure our value by our physical possessions.  Our real value comes from within and those around us. The love we carry in our hearts for others, and the love they give us in return is much more valuable than anything money can buy.  I would gladly trade my physical possessions for the loved ones I have lost. Would you?

If we were to put the entire population standing side by side wearing the exact same gown, with no make up, jewelry, handbags, shoes, or fake hair, could you tell the difference between the wealthy and not wealthy?  Could you actually consider yourself so different than the person standing next to you?  I would say the answer is no. The amount of money or material possessions you own does not change who you are in your heart. Loving yourself and others just as we all are is priceless and selfless. Never forget, we all started out helpless in this life.                                                                                                                  

Humble and kind is what we should all aspire to be. It is ok to treasure material things, but do not let it define who you really are. Enjoy the moments, not the momentos.
