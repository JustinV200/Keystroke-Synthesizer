According to me, being materialistic is somewhat important for the life being happiness for the day to day life. But it is not only the form of person to live a satisfied life.  I need to enjoy at the moment of my life, but I didnot always be materialistic person.

Everyone needs are different from others. For our needs and to lead a happy life only, we are doing a job and earning money. But when we need achieve our long term goal such as buying a home, to be a well settled person in the society, we need to sacrifice some of our happiness but not want to sacrifice all the enjoyment of our life. Then after all our commitments have finished, when we recall our life, we just feel sad for being like that person. Because we are having only one life to live, so we need to live the life satisfied and happily.

But if we only live the life for being happy at the moment and enjoying all the moments in our life, we cannot attain our long term goal, it remains for the same long after. It brings only the happiness for short term. Because of  being like this person, we doesnot have any savings to lead the future life.
