Focusing on the happiness of others is detrimental to your own mental health. Happiness is something to be cultivated through pursuing goals. The key word is cultivated. Happiness should not be chased. 

The reason why the happiness of others should only be considered but not focused on is because this is an easy way to lose your sense of self.  It becomes easier for people to take advantage of you, and if your sense of self is degraded, it becomes difficult to actually have sustainable happiness.

Happiness/Joy can be cultivated through achieving and working on non-rigid goals. Yes, you should hold yourself to standards, but the goals should be flexible to fit with an ever-changing life and society. You should always be forgiving towards yourself as well. A person should be able to listen to themselves, their bodies, their minds. A person should try to objectively look at the life being built and see what it needs to grow and flourish. Unfortunately, that level of self reflection is really hard to acheive. 

Our society and culture is always screaming unhealthy things at us, and it is really hard to take that step back and see what you need.  There's too much of  "Lose weight!  Buy this! Eat this! You need more stuff!"  Without taking a step back and seeing your life objectively, true happiness may be out of reach for many people. It is not a good idea to pour all your energy into other people because the sense of self will be diminished, and no happiness will come from that.  So, in conclusion, you are more likely to be happy if you are goal oriented and not focused on other people's happiness.
