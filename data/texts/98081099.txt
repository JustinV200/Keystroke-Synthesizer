Negative light of materialism
                                                    I think it is negative because it brings people the competitive, manipulative and selfish characters. Which is not appreciated by other peoples. Some people even become so objective. First, to get comfortable and popular. Second, to secure their life in thoughts of fear of future. Some people run for money without giving importance to family, friends, etc.,
