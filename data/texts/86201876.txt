Since the very beginning of societies, people have understood the importance of cooperation. Aside from there being safety in numbers, there was the undeniable fact that many hands make light work. Villiages, cities, towns and even nations formed through the cooperation of its citizens. Can you imagine the great wonders of the world, the pyramids, the Colleseum or the Sphinx, having been built without the combined efforts of many people? 

The world moves forward through cooperation. We make our greatest strides in humanity when we collaborate with others instead of competing against each other. Science, technology, medicine and the arts all are at their best when people work together toward a common goal. 

A very good example of this is the Covid 19 pandemic. When everyone worked together, we were able to create vaccines and treatments in an amazing quick amount of time. Imagine how many more lives would have been lost without the combined efforts of the scientsts from several different companies, countries and backgrounds. 

Some would argue that the human drive for competion is the real reason for success. That without the need to compete, people become complacent, lazy. Certainly some people do things to "win". We compete for fun. Football games are often called rivalries. It's all about the win. But one quarterback does not win the game alone. Tom Brady, as much as people think he is the stuff of sports legend, doesn't go out there and play alone. He cooperates with a team. And not just the players, but the coaches, staff and even the fans play a role in every Superbowl ring he owns. 

No man is an island. Even the most reclusive hermit lives in a country that is kept safe through the cooperation of the rest of people there. We do best and do greater things together.
