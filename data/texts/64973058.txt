 This is a question that can be seen from different sides without a doubt. The way that I see it, there are both good and bad ways that this can be viewed by each different invidual. As each person will look at things in a different mindset, depending on their specific situation. 
 People can be happy focusing on their own personal goals as it can be motivating to see progress. Getting further towards your goals is always a positive but falling behind your anticipated schedule can also be a bad thing. That could cause a person to not try as hard to succeed or even give up altogether. 
 Focusing on the happiness of others is also a double edged sword.  As doing this can give a person joy, but at the same time it can bring them a downward look upon themselves. The happiness can give a person joy as watching others experience happiness can make a person feel better and look at life a different way. But it can also make someone see things in a way that could have a negative effect. That could happen because they end up wanting the happiness that others have and wish it for themselves. 
 While both things can possibly happen, it mainly depends on each persons outlook and where they stand on each specific situation. As no two people are exactly and have the exact same mindset as all of our situations are different in their own way. People can also do both things at the same time. But its mainly about the person and how they look at things that makes the difference.
