I think modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic, but it also can depend on the level of materialism by the person. I don't believe there is anything wrong with enjoying yourself and buying things that make you happy or simply something you want as long as you can afford it. 
Material positions can make someone happy or provide a boost that someone might need. Someone might be depressed, or they've felt down in the dumps for a while, but they decide to go out and buy themselves a new outfit, a video game, or even something small like a book. That might put them in a better mood and help them get going again, get out of their rut and feel better. 
But on the other hand, there can be down sides to materialism because you can go too far with spending money, especially if you don't have a lot of it. Some people have spent money that they didn't have in the first place, only to drive themselves into debt or bankruptcy. That could ruin someone's life and would be especially detrimental if they have a family. But overall, I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying being a little materialistic in moderation or as long as you know your limits.
