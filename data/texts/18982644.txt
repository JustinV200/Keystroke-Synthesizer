Happiness, a complete sense of being relaxed, to feel free and have no worries in the world. Everyone wants to be happy, everyone wants to make their dreams come true, but how can they achieve it? Should they focus on themselves, or should they focus on others happiness first? The answer is simple, to be able to be happy people need to focus on themselves first.

By focusing on your own goals and dreams that make you happy, not only you can leave a worry free life, but also you would be increasing your self-steam and self-worth, and be in better health. For example, spending time with your family makes you happy, then by doing this you would be strengthening your relationships with your family members; or maybe watching TV makes you happy, then by doing this you would feel more relaxed and it will help your health in long term. But like with everything in life, extremes are not good. You should chase your happiness as long as it is within moral and legal limits.    

But some people may ask isn't this selfish, to focus only on yourself? While it might be selfish, if you don't take care of yourself first how are you going to be able to help others. Putting others happiness first might lead to resentment. You don't want to realize in the future that you have lost yourself, that any good emotions that you had and good intentions of helping others being happy, have turned into bitterness. Also, you don't want to overdo it and reach a state of being unhealthy. 

In the ultimate goal of finding happiness, you should focus on yourself first, and along the way you will see that if you are happy you will be able to make others happy easier. And who knows, just you being happy will make others feel happy too.
