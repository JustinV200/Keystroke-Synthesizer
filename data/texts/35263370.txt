      Is packaging more important than product? Many things account for making us buy things. Advertisements, packaging, word of mouth. What drives a person to make a purchase?
      We are bombarded by advertisements all day long. TV, magazines and social media ads are constantly being viewed. These advertisements often cause us to purchase things we might not have otherwise. After seeing the ad repeatedly when we go to the store and notice it on a shelf, our mind is drawn back to those commercials. That person seemed to really enjoy the product we think. And into out cart it goes.
      It's not just the ads that make us purchase an item though. Packaging can also play a huge roll in what we buy. That brightly colored box that catches our eye. Or maybe it's the marketing scheme of  tying in an item to a tv or movie franchise. Those Yoda shaped chicken nuggets or that Surfer Boy pizza box that somehow end up in your freezer, not because they taste better than the non franchised version but because we want a piece of our favorite story for ourselves.
      Word of mouth is the best reason for getting a  product. Or is it? Once upon a time people would have just talked up a product because they liked it. Nowadays, however, are they saying a product is good because they really liked it or are they getting a kick back from the company. Someone you follow on social media said this product was amazing but did they mean it or were they sponsered? Did they get paid? Did they have a code that will make them money on their next purchase? 
      Unfortunately the only way to know if something is really good or not is to actually try it for yourself. Try not to be taken in by flashy ads or pretty packaging and if you are, next time  grab a generic version and see if it lives up to the brand name product.
