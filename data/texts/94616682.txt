         I think images and impressions have too much effect on people. We are too hasty to just believe what we are shown instead of doing our own research. Even when we find out about the stuff behind the scenes, our brains tend to react more strongly to image instead. We look less at what really is and more at what we see. This has an effect on people that is pretty negative and can be really bad for society and us as a species. 
        Science has proven that we react more strongly to image, and that it has more of an impact on people than words do. Even when the words and images convey the same emotions as each other, the images have more of an impact. This means that when someone has formed an image of someone or something in their head, just finding out it isn't true by words is not going to have much of an impact. What this means for us is that brands and famous people and people running for office can make a persona based on images and what they want us to know about them and then we usually believe it. 
          To end on, I think that images have too much of an impression on people. I think that we as a society need to be more choosy about doing research on people and brands and not just taking them at face value. I think that people puttin gout an image of themselves or their brand that is not true to who they are should be considered false advertising and not be allowed. However, it is not up to other people to govern. We could take steps to make sure that the images and impressions have less of an effect on us, but it is very easy to just take the first image or impression as what is fact.
