I believe that society has created a pressure among the general population to strive for perfection. Many advertisements push for anti-aging products, weight loss products, and nearly every person in a commercial is beautiful with perfect skin and an ideal Body Mass Index. This pressure from social media causes many Americans to start on the journey for perfection.

Many people enjoy watching films but how many really notice the subliminal messages in them? Do we notice that most of the actors and actresses have the perfect dress size? The perfect smile? Acne free skin? How easily can people be sold any product that promises to help them maintain a youthful appearance? Now while I understand there are some people out there that may accept aging with grace and not feel the need to go to such extremes with their appearance, many of us are still susceptible to other subliminal marketing schemes. For example, you may choose a new brand of energy drink because you see an actor's face on the label promoting the brand. 

This craze for perfection has finally started to surface with its harmful effects. The latest trend I can think of is with the company Victoria's Secret. For years I would watch the fashion show every December and be in awe how many of these high paid models would look like perfection strutting down the catwalk. How was it possible or fair that these models could look so perfect while I was nowhere near that? I would then start to look in a mirror and inspect my imperfections.  This past year, Victoria's secret stopped their annual winter fashion show. Now, through what I believe is a result of a push from the public to see normalcy being presented, the major brand is having oversized models in their advertisements. While it may appear that this fashion giant is making strides in the right direction, I still believe there is a lot to overcome to ensure people realize that no one is perfect. Imperfections are normal and acceptable.
