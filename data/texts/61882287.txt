Yeah, I agree the point that images and impressions have a much effect on people because it makes an image that a person with have high image and status outsmarts their bad character if they had and make them look good and a person with low image and status are considered very bad even if they have a good and valuable character it was not been respected, this is because of some people made it a common character. First it need to be neglected by people, they should get aware of it that appearence and character are two different thing and it could vary if one is good or bad thus it is a bad behavior and it could lead to some major problems, so it need to rectified from people's mindset and people's judgemental behavior thus it could lead people get aware then they could get the mindset that to judge a good and bad one that they could be uniform and think uniform. Thus as a conclusion that most people are bad in their mindset that it need to be rectified to get the world in a pretty good manner thus they need to rectified by all people to lead a good life.
