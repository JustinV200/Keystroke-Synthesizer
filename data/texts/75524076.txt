Happiness is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. An elusive goal at the edge of our reach, yet so far from our grasp. We wrestle with thoughts of 'if only I had' or 'if only I wasn't dealing with' to seek to uncover the answer of why we are unhappy. Thinking if we could change one thing, anything, then perhaps the door to happiness would be unlocked and all would fall into place. What if the answer where not a thing, but rather a focus? On this there are two schools of thought. One suggests happiness is brought about by an internal focus on pursuing our personal dreams and goals. Another offers that an external focus on what we can do for others, is the way we tap into our our own happiness. While I find both bring a measure of joy, the internal focus is the one I feel brings about the deepest and most abiding sense of happiness.

Take a moment and think about where you are in your life. You may think of family, friends, career, and your hobbies. Now think about the next year, five years, or even ten years. Maybe you have some plans for the future coming to mind. How many of those are your personal goals? Are any of those your dreams? Often times we get caught up in our daily lives, moving from one routine to another, and we forget what makes us happy. It takes time and effort to know yourself.
