As said nowadays around us everything is advertised. the answer for the question do images and imporessions have too much of an effect on people? in my opinion is true nowadays.in ancient days the first language of communications is through sign and symbols. form ancient to now symbols, images, signs, impressions all had created too much effect on people. as said in the paragraph clever advertisements create favorable impressions because they focus more on people who are the basement for their advertisements. so they will focus more on their impressions like stores, colorful packages, themes and so on rather than content of their products or anything........
                      these advertisers are more clever by making their product more impressed with images and so on things to attract peoples. the basic concept these advertisers use is images and impressions  have too much effect on people.
                       as said in the media theser entertainers, politicians and other public figures appear with impressed rather thans howing their ablilities. all around us appearance are mistaken for reality. this lines means the people who have more effects on impressions on images are mistaken with reality. these people get confused that is what is reality and what are all the images........
