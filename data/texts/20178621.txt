Therefore, materialism should be criticized in some  following  reasons
1. we always consider ourselves materialistism gives happiness but thats was wrong, we have to understand that the key of happiness is love.The most beautiful emotion in the world,love can change anything for an example an evil can change as an angle , love has that much power to change anybody.Love pour happiness, peacefullness and fullfillness.
2.Another key of happiness is sharing, sharing is also consider as another form of love. In many research proved that sharing is truly powerful way to happiness, if you share anything with others that are very special to them. If  may be you are in a need to buy some material, but unfortunately you can't buy it .if you got that thing from someone, you feel like the happiest person.
