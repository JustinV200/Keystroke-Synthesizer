In modern times compared to historical events and those first grocery markets to advertise product to consumers.
Over time, this has gotten out of control as a 2 second advertisment can get enough of the consumer's attention to want to go out an purchase that food item or get that new upgraded phone etc.
There are several reasons why ads have taken over our minds. Competition for profit is the main reason quality of the product become of less focus and more focus is placed in marketing of that product.


Now why whould they do such a low down thing as that? It's because the companies that can pull it off are so huge as in they have franchises world wide wouldn't really take much of a hit in the pockets if one out of  one million of their stores had to shut down because the quality was poor. They have their human ethics deparments to insure that they don't break any violations and their research team to figure out how to get that logo as glamourous and appealing as possibly every where that it possibly can dumping out millions and millions of cash in marketing and in return recieve that ten fold in profit. It can be a called successful branding.

Products are not the only thing that can create sucessful branding generating profits. Public figures, politicians, celebrities all are just product of profit. If they have the skills to get millions attention then investors will see those millions of people as millions of potential buyers which is why the would invest in a person to gain access to their fan base for profit gain.

All of this information I have reviewed from different podcasts, documentaries and some of the things I learned when I took a course on capitalism in college.
