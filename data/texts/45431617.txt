       I think people are very happy when they achieve thier goals or focus on their own goals in their life and I think that is permanent because when ever they look back their achievements or when ever they told others of their achievements they feel very happy and that makes everyone happy. I think now a days people are very innocent and make everyones happy. But it is not at all permanent it was just temperary.
        If people achieve something to prove their own self to others will make people happy only who are all sorround him or her but that happiness will be going to take by one person who is responsible for the achievement or who is the participants of that achievements. whenever he or she remember his or her achievement that make a positive attitudes to him or her. I definitely support the happiness of their own achievements.
      I know one friend. he is very attractive and very knowledged and talented person. he recently achieve some good things and make everyones happy. In this moment I want to tell is, I can share my happiness of his achievement but I cannot carry this happiness to a long time because it was not my achievement. I think focus on their own goals are permanent happiness.
