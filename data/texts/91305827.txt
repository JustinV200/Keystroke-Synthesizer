Materilisim is necessary depending on the person and should not be critized. This is because if the person likes to buy stuff because he/she think that they will need it in the future then it is necessary and other people do not have the right to critize them. But if the person only buys stuff just to show off to people and will never use it that is when I think people can critize him/her because he/she is being wasteful when they could use that money for something useful like charity. I get that some people want to buy stuff just to show off their wealth but if they don't use it at all after 2 months or try to throw it away and buy a new one they should donate it to chairty instead. Then that way even though they bought it to show their wealth since they donated it to chairty it will be harder for people to critize them and it will be a win win situation since this person can buy something new without being reprimanded and they were able to help someone in the process. So,  I would say that mordern society should be only critized depending on the situation of why that materialistic item was bought for or if they later donate it to chairity when not needed anymore or just throw it away. If they just throw it away then that is when they should be critizied but if they give it to chairty that is when they should be appluded and thanked.
