Images and impressions can be deceiving, and they often are just that. Images are used to often deceive us in a way that will give us a favorable impression and in turn, lead us to buy what the image is promoting or watch what the image is promoting(like a movie poster promoting a movie). Impressions given by the media, for example, on people may be at least partially inaccurate because they want us to believe something or think about the person a certain way. This is why we need to stop letting us be so easily affected by just images.
The fact images can be used to deceive us so easily is why it's important to not be affected just by them but to also rely on descriptions or words. Yes, images are a great tool and can help us in our decisions, but as stated before, we can't rely solely on them. It's also important to remember we never truly know someone or something until we have gotten to know them in person(and even then, we may not truly know them). 
Think about it. You see a fat, juicy burger with fresh, sparkling veggies on an advertisement for McDonalds. You order that item because of that image. However, when you open the container, it looks more like a pancake. This is just one, simple example. Now, think about how many times the media portrayed someone to be fun, happy, a good person, but then news is released about allegations that were kept private in order to protect their public image. 
Images and impressions can be at least partially inaccurate and can be used to deceive us in order to draw us in. It's important to be cautious, do our research, and realize it may not always be what it seems. There's nothing more annoying than a tasty burger not living up to your expectations or your role model not being who you thought they were.
