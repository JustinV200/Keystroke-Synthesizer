   Are we more successful when we are competing or working as a team? I would like to take a look at both scenarios and guage each. Can we enjoy success if we achieve it as a team? Can we fully cooperate to that achievement or will we end up arguing amoungst ourselves? 
   When we build teams and cooperate with each other to achieve a task we are building trust and friendships. A hive like mind forcing us to look at the task from multiple angles and consider multiple opinions. If you are lacking in a skill or understanding one of your teammates may be able to pick up lacking. If we become competetive with our team members though, it could create a problem that stops us from achieving said task. As a team that cooperates and builds together, we can celebrate our task and each other. 
   If we are competetive and working on the task solo, we are driven by the idea of achievement over others. Even in small rivalries between friends we are likely to be incredibly competetive. This drive then forces us to work harder and what we would perceive as better. It would seem as though these drives could also lead to our failure. Causing us to overlook small obstacles or even misunderstand something like instructions. If we have a lack of skill or understanding alone, we are set for failure as there is no one to lean on. If we do reach achievement we are left to celebrate alone and only celebrating ourselves.
   While there are pros and cons to each side, it would seem as though cooperation and team work will lead to success more often. Having mutiple opinions, views and minds working on one task would lead to a better understanding and better feeling of accomplishment. The entire task would rest on one persons understanding and skill or lack there of. The best argument for working competetively and solo would be the sense of victory. Due to all these reasons I would personally prefer being cooperative and working as a team.
