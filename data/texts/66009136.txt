The world in general is a competitive place. It's ingrained into us from a young age that we need to be competitive to get ahead. We are taught that competitiveness is a healthy, fun and natural way to act. Competitiveness pushes us forward when we are young to do the best we can in school and athletics. It also motivates us when we are older to do better with our career and can help attract romantic partners. Competition teaches us that no matter how well we think we are doing there is always someone doing better that could pass you up.

Cooperation is a skill and tool that most people undervalue. Being cooperative teaches us how to build relationships and work in a team enviornment. Being able to work well in teams teaches us about ourselves which can lead to self improvement. Cooperation with others can teach us diversity and leadership plus create a sense of community. Learning these things can greatly benefit society and help you grow as a person emotionally. 

Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? After looking at each side closely, I'd say it is an equal collaboration of both. It seems that they are closely intertwined with each other in order to acheive sucess. Bottomline, to truly be successful you can't have one without the other!
