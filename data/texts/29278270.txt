As a whole, I completely agree that what is presented to us as a society is absolutely glamorized and made to look and act as beautiful, intriguing and - well, really, whatever brings in the big bucks.

Take the Disney Princess Franchise, for instance. I once watched a really interesting video on YouTube about what exactly makes a Disney Princess qualified to be this pronounced royalty.

It all boiled down to one thing;
Her Marketability.
Yep, her ability to bring in the most money because her outfit or sidekick is so iconic and so instantly recognizable is what makes a Disney Princess so omnipresent.

How disappointing, but honestly, how unsurprising. So Beauty (Belle) is a Disney Princess not because she's a strong, smart woman who teaches us what its like to see inner beauty - but because her golden dress and updo are so iconic as well as her friendly, adorable sidekicks - they've proven quite profitable in every way past their original debut.

Is it addressed that she is subjected to basically torture (no food? no friends? no going out? what?!) until she falls in love [ahem, definitely not love] with her captor? Nah. Glamorize it so we can make all the money! Make sure we can profit from the baby teacup, too. A lot.
And lets make sure we confuse kids about the giggling feather duster and her ENTIRELY WAY TOO AGRESSIVE suitor of a candlestick man.
"No" means, "no," LUMIERE.

I would like to take the time, however, to commend Disney for taking their power and using it to promote diversity and equality. I probably have rose colored glasses on, as most of us do with something so many of us grew up loving, but I am seeing Disney use their Mammoth status to help while they drown in their billions.

I wish more of society would take their lead and use their pull for good. Power and responsibility are definitely synonymous.
