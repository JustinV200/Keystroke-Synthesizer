What you see is not what you get when it comes to media.  So many people have become victims to social media, all forms of entertainment, advertisements and even word-of-mouth from family and friends, to the point where you don't know what or who to believe any longer.

Entertainers give you the impression that they're living their best lives and don't have a worry in the world until you see or hear something negative in the news or on social media that paints a different picture; this is when they want to play victim of just being human and making mistakes.  Same thing goes for people you know personally.  The only thing you ever see on their social media pages are the goods and not the bads.  Recently, I feel as if things are starting to come  clearer to people now and they see that everyone is not thin, tall, have abs of steel and perfectly made.  If so, this world wouldn't have an envious person in it, mostly big egos.  

Doctors feed on this type of negativity by perfoming the surgeries that are available to men and women that want to try and get that actor or performers body, nose or even eye color they think will make them happy.  Once they get the first one and see it wasn't enough, they're back in the doctor's office for more spending money they don't have and need to use for bills or keep in savings.  

It all goes back to a saying that my mom and grandparent's use to tell me growing up. It was either, "everything that look good aint good for you" or "looks can be deceiving." As a youngster I didn't understand why this was said, but now that I'm older I understand what they meant COMPLETELY! I just wish everyone else that felt bad about themselves did.
