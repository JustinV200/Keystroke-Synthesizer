I guess to answer the question of whether one would be happier focusing on themselves or focusing on others, you would have to look into the distinct personalities of each person. There is no clear cut answer for this as everyone is different and holds their own beliefs, character traits, and personal goals. However, if I am speaking from personal experience, I believe that happiness comes mostly in solitude. Unlike many others, I prefer being alone because my happiness comes from within. I can always find something to do that makes me happy, and it is always what I want to do, without the added worry of whether whoever I'm with will share the same views on the chosen activity.

I cannot speak for other people. I'm aware there are billions of people in the world that prefer being around others and thrive most when they are with friends and loved ones. But that is not me. Everyone is different. Everyone has different goals. Different aspirations. Different thought processes. Different personalities. One person's opinion is no better than the person next to them. And don't get me wrong: When I buy a gift for someone and I see their eyes light up was they open it, I feel as warm and fuzzy as the next person. But if I had to choose whether to focus on my own happiness or the happiness of others, my own happiness makes me the happiest. Does that make me a selfish person? Maybe. But it's me. People can't change, and to be honest, I wouldn't want to. 

There is a social stigma around people who are more shy and withdrawn as opposed to those who are confident and outgoing. We are frequently called "weird" or "strange" or even "creepy" just because our best friends are Me, Myself, and I instead of Karen, Judy, and Chad. But as long as you focus on what makes YOU the happiest, whether it be buying a gift for yourself or someone else, then anything anyone else says or thinks is irrelevent.
