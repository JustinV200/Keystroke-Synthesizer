I have struggled with materialism through the years. Combined with ADHD and a generally messy demenor means that I tend to buy multiple of the same thing when I can't find what item I was looking for. With a disposible income and Amazon, I now have probably 7 or 8 pairs of scissors scattered around the house. 

This wouldn't have been something that I even really thought about until I lost my job in July of 2022. I was working at a tech company and was laid off from my position as an instructional designer... I was thrust into a position of making my own destiny and finally getting a chance to work on my art full time for a while and see if I can make that my main business. I started looking around at all the material items I had on hand.

And through the years I had aquired all I needed to be self sustatinable. Many of the materials I bought in a consumerist materialistic fervor were just what I needed to get off the ground with my new company, and even though I had seen buying multiples as a negitive, I now had all the items I could ever want to produce more items. I feel as if i am able to really seize the means of production, becuase I have become the producer of my work. I'm proud of myself, and though I can't be as materialistic now due to not having as much income, I have decided that I have everything I need and materialism needs to come in waves to really be useful. I think it will destroy the fabric of everything we love down to microplastics in the sea, but at least I don't need to buy any more scissors.
