Yes images and impressions was always  plays a important roles in people's life. Because from our childhood we always see the world from this way. The product we consume the object we use always we buy on a impression depended. Because we think that the cool way but we never think about what content that have. The media also work that way they also project news or entertainment oriented this way so people blindly trust this or like this.The color of the packages was attract the people to buy the thing more than use of it.
More than a impression we was always want to search the content because the impression was faded when i get into a long period but the content or usage of the particular thing was always gives us a useful thing. Sometimes the reality was failed due to this appearances concern. So that will become a habit to lose the importance of reality when we always concern about the appearance or impression. Impression also a important thing in this generation but it was not only a important the reality was far better than the impression. People also know that the reality was more important than a apperance but we always fool by this society when it comes to impressions.
The celebrities we follow, the influencers we like, the politicans we trust will use this tricks to fool us  if we don't be carful about the reality  because appearance or impression will help to easily make us get rid from reality. People must be think about the development of the society and improvement of the surroundings more than a impression and appearance. I agree that thepeople too much concern about image and impressions now a days. But we must need to never get away from the reality because of this. We want to think about the quality of the content than the image or impression of it. But time will change the things the people concern about the impression or images that will change everything the way we see.
