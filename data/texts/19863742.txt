              In my opinion for meterialism , all societies have always been materialistic. The history of civilization is effectively summarized as the maker of more and better stuf. There's nothing superficial about that. In fact, no longer having to devote every waking hour to sustenance and survival allows us all much time to contemplate our philosophical and spiritual interests.

               Society was superficial and materialistic , becauseit has lost its moorings. it has lost its sense of god and has filled up this yearning with. material goods . then there are those  who just simply desire only material good. only god can fill up this emptiness. it is because they lack the virtues. wealth , honors. power cannot fulfill us because I made for the eternal realities. material good draw us away from this. we all naturally desire immortality , a desire that cannot be frustrated but can be frustrated by materialism. i think people who are this materialistic are superficial , lack in virtue and ruled by pride.

              There will never be enough for a truly materialistic person. things are being updated almost hourly and it is impossible to keep up. materialistic feel a sense of panic and failure it they can't keep up with their friends and acquaintances and if they can't outdo them they think they lose face.
