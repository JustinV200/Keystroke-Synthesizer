     People approach achieving a goal in a variety of different ways. Some people like to work independently while others thrive in a group setting. No matter which way people prefer to take on a task, there is a divide between what can be accomplished working competitively or cooperatively. Even though people are often driven to win and have a competitive spirit, more can be done in the long run if people work together and cooperate.
     When people work individually and try to out do others, it might seem that they have an advantage because they are driven to win. But actually, those individuals miss out on the opportunity for input and encouragement from others. When you're working on your own, you don't have any other perspectives and don't have the ability to divide tasks among those who are the most adept at the different things needed to make something succssful. But if a group works cooperatively, each individual can bring their strengths to the project and allow everyone to work in ways that are most effective for them.
     Working cooperatively doesn't have to mean working constantly with others. Some people work better on their own so these individuals can be given specific tasks as part of the cooperative approach of the group, but work on them by themselves. Groups can meet up periodically to share progress and brainstorm on next steps. So even introverts can accomplish more when working cooperatively with others. 
     Whether your next project is personal or professional, consider adding a cooperative component to it. Other individuals can bring perspectives, support and encouragement that can bring a dynamic approach to a project and make it more successful. Cooperation will result in a better outcome than competition.
