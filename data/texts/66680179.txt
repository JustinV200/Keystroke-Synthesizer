In my opinion I believe that people achieve success by cooperation when it is compared with achievment by competition. When people cooperate in order to accomplish a goal then both people win or achieve as the case may be.

When two people or teams compete against each other ther must always be a winner and a loser, however when they all work together everyone can succeed making it the best option for everyone involved. Why would someone want to pit people against each other in order to achieve a goal knowing that there has to be a loser when if we cooperate everyone can get the job done quicker, at least that is my thought process.

I have worked in places that do competitions with their employess in things like how much they sell and it just leads to employees being bitter with each other and I personally did not enjoy working in the stressful environment that it created. You see this especially when you look at places whose employees work off of commission, just thinking back to working at a place like that gives me anxiety. 

In contrast I have worked at places where we all worked together, be it working on the same thing at the same time or creating an assembly line type to get everything complete, regardles, we all cooperated to achieve or daily and weekly goals and that felt so much better.
