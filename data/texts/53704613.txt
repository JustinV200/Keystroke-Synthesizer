     It is often said to no judge a book by it cover but it is almost impossible to live up to thought even when it comes to the simpliest of things. Images, impressions, colors patterns anything you can think of have an effect on people on ways they might not even be aware of. Some are very subtle as well. There could be a number of reasons different studies can have a different anwser to the quetion to why that is but the reality is, what we see is what we determine reality to be.
     Imagine you're a hiring manger and two people come in to interview. With out realizing you are already forming an opinion on these people with out even talking to them just but what they are wearing. That same thing happens every time you are looking for something new at a store looking for an item. If one package is bland and the other package has a fine design and color your eyes are more drawn to it. More often then not the products in the box preform the same but what we see is how they look on the oustide. Regular men do it every day the pick a woman based of their looks with out knowing anything abou her, many applications were based off that same idea, example tinder. 
     We can't do anything in the day with out being effected by the image of someting. We turn on netflix and pick what to watch based off the pictures in the front. Every day is literally judging a book by its cover. Companies especially use this they do studies to see what people would go towards more so they get that product instead. Some of the choices we make essentially really were not ours to make because we saw something and we thought we knew what it was. What we see becomes what we know even if it's not right.
