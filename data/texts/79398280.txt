I do think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. I think that we are too into stuff. We want to consume, consume, consume but we are not as focused on helping others as we should be. If we all spent the money we spend on things on other people, we would all be a lot happier. 
Jesus wanted us to help others and not be focused on ourselves. By spending our money and time on others we can stray from a materialistic world. We are very materialistic and we work so we can buy more stuff and not work to better society.
We also are addicted to spending money. We spend and spend without thought. We spend to feel a rush of happiness but that quickly wears off. For example, when we go shopping at the mall and spend our money, we feel very happy. We love the rush of new things. We are addicted to new things because we think material desires are what will make us truly happy. But, we will not be fulfilled by stuff, we will be fulfilled by serving others. We should be more selfless and more concerned with helping build a better country and world.
