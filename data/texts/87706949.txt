I do not believe that images such as those found all around us in advertisements have much of an effect on people. I suppose they could, if someone is very naive and has never encountered anything like that before. But, living in the modern world and being surrounded by advertisements, the images that we see are easily tuned out and have very little impact on us, if any at all.

I can give an example by appealing to something we have all experienced in the form of internet advertisements. Most advertisements these days will say the word "advertisement", or "paid promotion", or something like that next to them. Even when the words are not there, you can usually tell very easily if something is an ad. IT just looks different. People who speak in ads have an odd way of speaking, for example, they might recommend an operating system to eachother or something that people never actually do in real life.

When I see an ad like this, I recognize it as such immediately and feel instantly annoyed. I ignore the content. I feel hostile to the content. If it is an ad for something I already am using, I will stop buying said product or use it less. I actually could save money on GEICO, maybe, but I refuse to used it because I will not pay people to annoy me. 

Advertisers who attempt to hijack our minds and get us to respond to an image in a natural way, while really using it to sell something, are not going to be successful because it just doesn't work, we recognize what they are trying to do and it backfires.

So, overall, I do not think images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.
