materialism is very sensitive topic and we are not willing to face this issue. This makes 
 a few people talk and face the topic and this should not be the case. material issue is ideal and it will save us great deal. the issue with morden society is failure to identify the rightful position  of material things, and how they will really have a rightful place to make the society look well and balanced.we all need material things in order to transact and do great things for ourseves and the society. sometimes most of us make a mistake to put material things before anything else. to prosper in life one need to be well rounded by that I mean that we should balance social life and material life. materials are good but they should not make us become  selfish and pleasure loving forgeting how to help others. we should not let material things come between us and family and even friends. sometimes money can not provide all that we need in order to be happy. the society sometimes also fails to undestand that materials are good to sustain the society but sometimes we feel that materials are evil and condemn it forgeting that materials helps us to buy things we need and do things that are important in life.
