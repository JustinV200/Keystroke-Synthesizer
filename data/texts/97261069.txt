I would have to agree that modern society is too materialistic. I see it everyday on social media. It seems these days that all people want to do is acquire material things and show them to the world to try to brag or boast. In the next paragraph, I will answer whether or not modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. 

In my opinion, modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. I believe that everyone should be able to express themselves how they see fit. Even though I am not materialstic and I believe that society is, I cannot tell them how they should behave. In my home country, we were taught to value family and the people who love us. But that is not the case for many others. In today's TV and on social media, all you see is people boasting about their possessions and I think that is the reason society has become so materialistic. But at the same time, I feel that they should not be criticized because that is how the new generation is growing up and they don't know any better.

In conclusion, I do agree with the prompt about society being materialistic. But, I do not agree that modern society should be criticized. Other than being criticized we can take the time out to teach them that there is more to life that gaining material things.
