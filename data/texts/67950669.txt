I believe that appearances are important, because the expression is, act like you belong, and you will.  Nobody wants to look bad, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's any substance to what they are putting out.  It might be nonsense.  However, there is a value to having name recognition, and sometimes that alone is enough to sell a product.  Sometimes just being popular is enough, regardless of what the product might be.  

Now, on the other hand, sometimes, there is a legitimate background and basis for what this person might be trying to sell.  If I see an old football player, who's been beaten up over the years is trying to sell a painkiller of whatever kind, that person lends credibility to what they're trying to sell.  I think well, I know this guy has taken his lumps over the years, if it works for him, maybe it will work for me.  

A recognizable face is valuable.  No matter what it is.  That's why companies have spokespeople.  It works.  If the product turns out to be bad, then the first thing people are going to think about is the spokesperson, not the product, at least initially.  They take a lot of pressure off of the company.  

A great commercial or a clever ad are remembered, for good or for bad.  So, therefore, a great ad campaign will stick with people, they will remember it.  Sometimes the product isn't even mentioned in the advertisement, but yet we still understand the deeper meaning and it goes without saying.  To me, those are some of the best ads.  They don't treat you like an idiot, they treat you like you're intelligent.  You either get it or you don't.  The perception is that if we think it might be a great product, then it probably is.  Whether it's an actor, an athlete, a politician, you have to take it with a grain of salt and determine for yourself how sincere you think that person might be, if they actually might know something about the product, if they actually believe in the product, and if it's worth purchasing.
