Happiness lies along people when they are single or may be with others. Everyone needs happiness in this world. The only thing is they got it from achievement of something they want to be. Whatever they want, if they acheive their own goals they will be definitely happy.
First of all, a person is more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. As a person, Self confidence and Self motivation is very important. I believe that achieving personal goals will give happiness. 
Why because, if a single man starts to focus on his goal he wish to be and keep on trying without any hesitation and continous effort he will acheive the goal succesfully. So, Once he achieves the goal he will be happy. He manage his own circle and will start to satisfy those people. By doing this the surroundings will be happier then. Otherwise, he cant focus or happy with anything. In this competitive world, no one is depending on others. So, Everyone should have a goal and focus on their own goals. Through this they can help others. Humanity is also important. If a person earns more than enough they can give to others. But everyone should help others whatever they can able to give who are financially helpless.
