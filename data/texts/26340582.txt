     Materialism in the modern world; a goal for some, and a cause for criticism from others. We are taught from a young age to work hard to be able to live comfortably and provide for our families, but at the same time we are condemned if we cross that imaginary line of becoming too materialistic. Is there reason behind these opinions, or are those of us that are less forunate just jealous of the success of others? I, for one, believe that while comfort is a necessity of life, there is a point where materialism can be taken too far.
     While the majority of us strive to earn more than just a livable wage and be able to afford a few comforts in life, where do we draw the line between a reasonable amount of possessions, and becoming overly materialistic? While some may argue that there is no limit to what is reasonable, I think that there is a point where it becomes irresponsible. If someone who has an excess of resources spends their money frivolously and unnecessarily, it takes away from someone who is in need. The money spent on frivolity could go towards someone who is less fortunate, in the form of donations to charity, buying items for a food pantry, or helping a neighbor with their bills. I believe that anyone who has the opportunity or potential to help those in need, as long as they themselves would not suffer because of it, it is their responsibility to do so. To think or act otherwise, would be selfish.
     In closing, while people are free to do what they want with their money, I believe that materialism is a cause of global pain that could be easily mitigated. If we have the opportunity to help those in need before being greedy for our own materialitic gain, I believe we should do everything in our power to do so, even when not required.
