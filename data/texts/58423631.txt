As a society should we be criticized for the way we have become a materialistic species. We thrive on "stuff". More and more we just keep looking to buy more stuff. We have to have the newest iphone, the fanciest car, the biggest tv. Should we be criticized for this or is it just who we have become as humans.
 I have grown to realize that spending my hard earned money on things just because it's the coolest thing at present won't make me feel any better. Should I be criticized for doing it though. I believe that, yes, I should, It's ridiculous that we spend, spend, spend. 
 I think that it's absolutely insane that there are people in my country that on one end of the spectrum are spending enough to feed close to a million people on something like a car when on the other end of the spectrum there are people eating out of dumpsters and sleeping in tents under bridges.
  A person could say that it's not one persons responsibilty to take care of another and I agree but I can't help but think I am right for criticizing this absurdity.
 So, do I think modern society should be criticized for being so materialistic, yes, I certainly do, how can you think it's perfectly fine for someone to be hungry in America in this day and age? Just do this, search on google the number of homeless in California and Wahington Dc and then  search and find out the amount of money Wal-Mart and Amazon take in one Black Friday and tell me if you don't feel like criticizing materialisim a little bit.
