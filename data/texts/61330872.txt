This is a tough question to answer and it will depend on several things going on in each individuals life. For me personally I feel that there needs to be a proper mix of each in order to properly be happy in life. The differences of making yourself happy versus making others happy is great. The feelings for me at least are stronger when I can make someone elses day and see them happy. I do like to make myself happy by doing things that I enjoy as well. Happiness comes in many forms.

When making others happy due to your actions it can make you feel great to know that  you made someones day. Something as simple as making someone smile can both brighten their day and yours at the same time. Likewise the more people would do this for each other the more happy everyone in the world would be. Doing things for others is what us humans are supposed to be doing anyways as that is the way we had to love more thousands of years before we could be so independent. We are at our core social creatures and doing things for others is one way that we can continue making others and ourselves happy.

While making others happy is great there must be some time set aside for ourselves in order to have some personal time.We need this time by ourselves because if we dont have anytime to ourselves we dont get much done in terms of personal care. There is something special about learning to enjoy yourself by yourself. Once you learn this doing some activities alone allows you to really clear you mind and enjoy yourself with no other distractions.

So whether you view focusing on yourself or focusing on the happiness of others as more important, either way doing more of them will make you happier in general. We as humans enjoy watching others be happy which in turn makes us happy and makes everyone enjoy life a little bit more.
