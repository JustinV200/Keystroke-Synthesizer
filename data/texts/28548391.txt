Images and impressions have a lot of effects on people. It's all about money and marketing, using big names to promote a certain prduct in order to convince the masses that a product is good. A lot of them don't really have that ability.

A lot of times we don't know any background about a product, but we get sucked into purchasing a product because of the name pushing the product and we believe them because of their like, instead of the seeing what the products can actually do. We believe if they're promoting it then there has to be some truth to whatever they are promoting especially if its skincare for example, if a celebrity is endorsing the product and they already have beautiful skin then we believe it will work without even thinking how long have they been using the product, what are the instructions, will it work on my skin type. so, the way things are packaged, the media and the person pushing the product is more impotant then what the product can actually do. Why? because them pushing the product with names and colorful packaging will boost more sales regardless if the product does what it's meant to do. This is false advertising.

We need to focus more on what products are all about and foucs on the product and not the name, or media pushing the product, maybe then these companies will be forced to work on quality products that will actually work and not just something they can push because of the likes behind the products. That first starts with us asking questions about what can the products do, who will it work for and the actual research behind a product, using regular everyday people who have used the product push the and promote the product. We need to stop believing what we see or believing others ability without knowing what they are about.
