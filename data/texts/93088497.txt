Is modern society too materialistic? Is materialism bad? The answer is yes to both questions. Materialism is a falsehood. Pursuing it is denying the Truth of our life. Truth is eternal, mattter changes forms endlessly. Pursuing matter is like a dog chasing its tail. The correct path is to turn back from materialism and dive within ourselves to find the Truth that never changes, that wasn't born and will never die.

So what is this Truth within us that is eternal and unchanging? It is consciousness. We all have it. Indeed, we are all IT. No one can deny that they are conscious. And what is consciousness? It is our constant subjective experience. No one can observe it. It is the observer itself. You can't get behind consciousness. Max Planck the Father of Quantum Physics agrees. Consciousness is the deepest possible state of our Being. It is the true Deep State. And since consciousness is not material it is eternal. It survives when our material bodies die. 

Materialists claim that consciousness arises in our brains. But that is a lie. They can't explain it. Because they can't observe it. You can't explain what you can't possibly see, can you? They call Consciousness the "Hard Problem" because they are unable to explain. Yet they have faith that someday they will be able to do so. But consciousness lies beyond the comprehension of the scientific materialists because it does not belong in the observable world that the scientific method is limited to. Yet it exists. Only the insane would deny they are conscious.

So in conclusion: the supernatural is real. It is the most indisputable reality. Therefore materialism is foolish. Because it is not fundamental, Consciousness is. Our core reality is subjective not objective. And only the subjective-minded can attain the Truth of our existence. These truths can lead us out of the false paths of materialism and atheism.
