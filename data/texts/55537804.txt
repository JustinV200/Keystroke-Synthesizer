When society starts to value materials, owning them and procuring them over the lives of their fellow humans, then yes we should be criticized. Criticizing members of society can be a necessity so they realize where their priorities lay. 

If a local school board wants to raise taxes to pay for a high school that is unsafe for the staff and children that go there, they put up a measure.  The local tax payers need to review why the tax is necessary, and vote.  Some tax payers will complain that they don't even have children, or others will say the tax is too high. Meanwhile, the staff and students are in a 60 year old building full of mold and asbestos.  The welfare of these staff members and students should come before the extra few dollars a month that will go towards something the tax payers might not really need but rather, want.  

The hope is that if you do not call out society members is that they will realize it on their own.  That will come too little and late.  Besides putting other people before your materialistic needs, the other thing to take into account is the environment.  How much waste is being put out there because you have to have the new phone every year? Even though there isn't much of a change from year to year.   

I work hard, just as most people do, and I want to buy all types of things that I don't need and might not last long. People in society should be able to spend their money how they decide. This is a good counterpoint. In America, we have a terrible capitalistic economy. Buy, buy, buy, is the motto. Got to have the brand new thing, or buy from this brand to be the cool kid. 

Modern society should be critized for putting themselves, as an individual in front of other members of society and the environment. They should think clearly and ethical when making purchases.
