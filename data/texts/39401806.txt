Personal happiness can be acquired by a person acquiring their needs and achieving their goals. Can you be happy if your neighbor buys a car you ever dreamt of in life and gets the happiness he desires? Definately no. You can satisfy yourself by having what you have and what you plan to have.

In this life people persue different goals and have their reasons as to why they are doing the same. We have interests in different feilds and each and every person aims at getting to his or her dreams. Top muscians once had a dream, top business people once had a desire and everyone at the top of his field. Imagine the joy a person gets when he becomes the best musician in the world. He will definately be the happiest person in the world for achieving such a dream. Someone who had a dream to be the top musician can not have the happiness he desires because his or her friend becomes the greatest musician. It only takes an individual to persue something and this will bring the ultimate happiness when someone looks back and says he is proud of the process and what he has attained.

It just takes an individual alone to be happy in life. You can never be happy because of the accomplishment of another person. Focusing  on someone else happiness will never make anyone happy as you may be suffering while others are happy and enjoying life. Everyone needs to go out and work their dreams and this will certainly bring the happiness and comfort in life. Something that you have not worked for can not be sweet enough as compared to what you have worked for.
