Some people believe that they can only be happy by pleasing others. They will go to great lengths to help someone. Yet when they are alone or to themselves they are often sad and miserable. 

I beleive that in order to be happy you must first be happy with yourself. If you are only happy helping others you are not truly happy, you are simply covering up what is going on inside. 

If you help someone and are happy because of it, what happens when you or that person leaves. Do you lose interest in things and/or look for the next person to helpand make happy. If the answer to that question is yes, chances are you are only happy for a short time, you are not paying attention to your own needs or you are ignoring them.

I have fallen under this myself. I very much enjoy helping others. I have been in some type of customer service job for the majority of my working career. I often ignored my own happiness. 

A big clue for me that took years for me to see and understand was that even in a room full of people I knew, enjoyed being around, and cared for, I still felt alone on the inside. Even though I was outwardly showing enjoyment to the people around me, inwardly I was screaming for help looking for that connection that would finally help me.

I have since begun to focus more on myself. Caring for myself by respecting my own wants and needs first before those of others. When I do this and I am happy with myself and who I am I can now help others in a better way because it is coming from a person who is happy with themself and not just because they are helping someone else.

While you may be happy for short periods of time when you help others to be happy, if that is your only source of happiness then there are missing pieces to the puzzle that you must find so you are first happy with yourself. 

By putting yourself first you are puttin you best self forward. In doing so you are in a better position to help and be happy with others.
