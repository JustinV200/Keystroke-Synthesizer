Happiness is diffult to quantify. Some may be happy with less, and others require more to be happy. One aspect of happiness that is true for everyone is that happiness can only be achieved when we our content with our lives and we have reached fulfillment. We feel fulfilled when we work towards dreams and personal goals. Different societies have different feelings about happiness. In more individualist societies, indiviual happiness is more valued, like in the United States.  Collectivist societies value the needs of the group more, such as in Asian countries.

If we do not strive towards dreams and goals, we feel regret and aimless. Not feeling fulfilled can cause depression, and happiness will never be reached.

Helping others can make someone feel good and proud of themselves, but not necessarily make someone truly happy unless their dream is to make others happy. A lot of people go through life helping other people, without making themselves happy first. People may spend so much time making others happy that they don't make enough time for themselves.

On our way to achieving dreams and goals, we can unexpectedly find happiness. Perhaps we came across something we never knew we enjoyed. Although this is true, we still still have to reach dreams and goals tough these dreams and goals may be ever changing.

So, to be truly happy in life we must continue to strive for self improvement. Constanly working towards goals will make us content. When we are happy with ourselves, we can then help others and improve humanity.
