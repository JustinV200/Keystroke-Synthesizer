Across all cultures of life, we can see that people develop in different ways but the main thing that can't be disputed is the fact that we can only help others when we develop ourselves. Happiness is derived from satisfaction and contentment with life, and the root of this satisfcation comes when are able to create personal goals. 

There are many types of personal goals as goals may pertain to financial wealth or personal growth. Regardless, goals will result in some type of empowerment of self. Through this empowerment, people are able to source more happiness and in effect influence their lives for the better. For example, someone who has been stuck in a job that they don't like would quit and create a goal of finding a better job. Had they been focused on the happiness of others, like the boss of said job, they would have stuck to the job and continued to be unhappy. Not only does this unhappiness lead to destruction in well being, but also could result in bad work quality.

In conclusion, happiness is derived when we focus on ourselves and create goals that enhance ourselves. The effects of focusing on personal goals will result in overall net positive gains within the community.
