"V-I-C-T-O-R-Y, victory, victory, that's our cry. Go team." This is a cheer that takes me back to my high school years. Every one wants to succeed. Everyone wants victory. The question is what's the best way to achieve success and to thereby avoid failure? People can achieve success both by cooperation and by competition. However, I believe more people achieve success by cooperation. 

Take someone who is going to the gym for instance. If they have a  workout buddy or go to the gym with someone else, I believe they may be more apt to stay at the gym longer, try new equipment at the gym, and are more likely to take a class. Thus a person woud achieve significant more all over success. Whereas if someone goes to the gym just for competition. They may workout harder for a short amount of time, run faster, lift heavier weights, et cetera, but when the competition is over they are likely to quit their workout. Thus a person will not work out as long if they are competiing as they would if they were there copperating with a workout partner. 

However some people depending on their personality and if they are especially competitive may achieve more success by competition than by coperation. 

As an introvert, I don't often do things in cooperation with others. I make my own competion with my own goals. I guess the most important thing, to me, would be not how I acheive the sucess, alough I am a bit competitive, but the fact that I do achieve whatever goal I have set for myself. 

So with this example in mind I am going to say people achieve sucess more by cooperation than by competition, whether these successes are financial, health-wise, relationship-wise, pertaining to skills or involving ideas.
