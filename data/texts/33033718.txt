As of my experience, people achieve more success by competition more than cooperation.Both competition and cooperation is needed for everyone at everytime. But only one among them will be the best and it it competition. Cooperation will make you to to interact and work with other people in a group to achieve the goal, but competition will make you to think about your positive and negative things and help you to analyse it, work according to it and the result will be successful.

Competitions with others will make you to work hard and it will help you to work smartly.  You will always give your 100 percent effort while having competition with others, you'll become better and improve yourself if you focus on competitions. It will improve your self competitions. You will never stay the same and will move forward step by step and achieve all the goals one by one.

Cooperation helps you to work with others and develop relationship with them. It has nothing to do with success. In groups, you need to focus on group work only and it will not help you to become a successful person. So, in my opinion competition is the only key to achieve more success.
