Not much is know in the very distant past as far as what was the main deciding factor for a enduring accomplisment, was it a cooperative action or purely competive? but we know in some cases the accomplishment held true. i can say with some certainty that that when im try my hardest to accomplish a set goal. I like to find all my options and a lot of times i need anothers cooperation even if it mean ill be working alone for the most part to accomplish my goals. I feel that i only resort to being a competive indivisual if all of my resources are no longer relevent. Some would agure that being competive  to a leads to a better viewing of showing ones cooperation but, I feel that could potentially steer the task off course so, being more of a cooprative persom from the start and show you dont like to quit at trying and succeeding, it can a have a great value to the ultimatium is becoming a constant so, all in all, I would say with  a moderate level of truth being a cooraptive indivisual is resonably more structured way to follow through with required task to succeed.
