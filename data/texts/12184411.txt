Should modern society be criticized for being too materialistic? People seem to have a love hate realtionship with materialism. Often times, we try to emulate the celebrity style only to find it unaffordable and unrealistic. People often go into debt trying to keep up with the latest trends. This can lead to feelings of unworthiness. Materialism can be ok in moderation and if you stick to certain guidelines.

The first guideline is to set a budget and stick to it. It is not bad to want nice items but be sure you can afford it. Nothing is worse than getting evicted from your apartment because you spent the rent money on shoes. Consider setting aside $20 a paycheck or doing odd jobs for extra income to pay for your wants but never go into debt. If you are already in debt because of materialism, develop a plan to get out quick and stick to it. 


The next guideline is to put your future first. Saving money for your future should  come before any short term purchase. Also, think abut the enviroment. All of these throwaway items end up in landfills and pollute the earth. A good tip is to look for free or used items that will keep waste out of dumps and be friendly on your wallet.

Finally, be happy with yourself. All the posessions in the world won't satisy you if you are miserable. Write down and identify a want vs a need. Ask yourself why you want the items. What purpose do they serve in your life? And don't try to copy influencers or famous people. What you see is all fiction. Their job is to make you desire a product. An influencer is nothing more than a commerical. don't make your mental health suffer because you feel that you can't compete.       

Modern society shouldn't be criticized for being too materialistic but we should learn from it and try to change our ways for the next generation.
