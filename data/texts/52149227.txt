     Persuing dreams and goals makes people happy. Another way to make yourself happy is to make other people happy. However selfless this may be, focusing on yourself will make you happier in general. People are more happy if they focus on their own personal goals.
     When you focus on your own goals, you know exactly what you will make you happy and satisfy your goals. If you are focused on making others happy, you do not know what will actually make them happy. This ambiguity could end up leaving everyone unsatisfied, which is why it is best to focus on your own goals. Knowing what you want and going for it full force will make you happier. 
    You have no control on what others want or need. You only have control over yorself. Trying to make others happy, can cause a sense of lacking control, which can lead to unrest and unhappiness. While it is quite kind to want others to be happy, putting oneself first is best for each person in the long term. Sometimes focusing too much on other people can cause one to lose a sense of self as well, which is another reason to focus more on your own happiness rather than other people's happiness. 
    Yes, it may seem selfish to focus on your own happiness over others. However, each person focusing on his or her own happiness is the most likely way for more people to be more happy. Happiness can be contagious as well. If you are happy, the people around you will be happier also. In conclusion, people are more likely to be happy if they mind their own business and focus on their own goals and ambitions.
