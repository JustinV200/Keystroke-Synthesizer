The year is 2022. Celebrities are iconically publisizing their lives in courthouses. The youth are infatuated with the idea of going viral. Politicians say one thing in the media and do the opposite behind closed doors. Yet the lives we see socially, are not the lives actually lived. More often than not, people are just wearing a hat that fits rather than the one they would choose. We tend to hide behind a facade of perception. There is no such thing as absolute reality. It is actually only what you make it.

The reason that people are so intrigued by the need to "fake til you make it", is because of how the media represents the way we should live. The inticing commercials and ads dominate the majority of our lives whether we engage or not. The fact that corporations use the human mind against us, is ironically facinating. They take our weakness and manipulate us into believing we are not good enough. I say, enough is enough. 

We need to accept who we are without falsifying our livelihoods. Government officials need to accept responisbility for those they represent and take accountibilty for any wrong doings, so things can be recitified. Celbrities need to acknowledge the many different lifestyles that they represent. Fame should come with heroism, rather than meaningless and often reckless  acts of attention. We must be mindful of our own perceptions so we do not get caught up in the hype.
