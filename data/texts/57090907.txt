    I believe that images and impressions do in fact have too much effect on people. It's very easy to get swept up in colors, flashy packaging and the outside the seller or person wants us to see they are represented as, when in fact often times things are not only different from how they appear, they are nothig like what is being perveyed.
     For example, many name brand produts in a store have bright, catchy colors and slogans on them. Its really easy to want to purchase those items compared to the let's say "off brand" items that are the same thing, have the same ingredients and serve the exact same purpose as the name brand items, but we tend to see them as less than or not as good as the name brand items becasue of the flashy packaging and bright colors and catchy slogans.
     In contrast to my previous point, there are somenamee brands that are far superior than their off brand counterparts, and that kind of makes the bright colors and flashy packaging irrelevant to the arguement. Some off brands even have packaging almost identical to their name brands so they product is pretty much equally as flashy as the name brand, but that doesn't mean it is as good as the name brand.
    In conclusion, I think regardless of the bright colors and flashy packaging, it really depends on the product itself. We just have to go by trial and error to see if what we are getting is influenced by images and impressions.
