I strongly believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on themselves. This is for several reasons. People nowadays have their priorities all in the wrong places. They try not putting themself first and this leaves them banking on the other person being happy without allowing themself any happiness leftover. People might think that they are happy when other people are happy but this feeling is without a doubt only temporary. When people are more focused on the happiness of others, it automatically leaves all of their happiness out of the door.

When observing Maslow's hierarchy of needs, two of the top levels are achieving esteem and also achieving self-actualization. This is naturally impossible because both of these ideas have to come from within your own self. When you work on your own personal goals, this maximizes the potential that you will be happy. There is no way to actually be completely happy just if someone else is happy. The only reason they are happy in the first place if because they valued themself over every single other person.

In today's society, it has somehow become a negative connotation to put yourself first. I also need to preface this by saying not to be completely careless towards other people. However, when dealing with your own happiness, it is the most important to start and prioritize your own success and your own goals over anyone else to fully maximize your potential.
