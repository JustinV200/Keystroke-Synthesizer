Cooperation between people has been an essential element of success for people since the beginning of time. People are meant to be communal and humans rely on one another for survival. Back in the days of the caveman basic security and safety from predators was a primary concern. Humans are safter if they work together and help one another and look out for each other. 

In more modern times people have needed to work together to make our greatest creations. More things can be invented and manufactured when people work together cooperatively. Everyone benefits from increased innovation of products and services.

Success can be measured by basic survival in which case the cooperation of humans is needed to survive things like predators and war. Success can also be measured by the aquisition of things and these things are most likely made and thought of by people that worked together. 
When humans compete with one another the division that exists creates negative feelings like competition and jealously. These emotions are counter productive to getting important things done that lead to success. If our relationships are more cooperative they will be less stressful and leave us free to achieve things with our time and mental energy.
