Chris Rock once joked that when you go on a first date "you're not meeting a person, you're meeting their representative."  The point is that deception is there from the start. Your date is hoping that "their representative" will be mistaken for themselves; that appearence is mistaken for reality.

This, of course, is not restricted to dating. We�see it in advertising, media, politics, and in almost every space where one is trying to make a good impression. If successful, at the end of the day, appearence becomes reality. It is not what you are that counts, but what you appear to be. 

Is this harmful? Do mere appearences have too much power, too much of an effect on people?  The obvious answer is yes. Appearences hide reality just as a package hides its contents. Mistaking reality for something it is not will inevitably result in reality coming back to bite us.

But what is the counter argument to this? It is the postmodern notion that we make our own reality. Reality is simply what we say it is. This belief can indeed take someone a long way. If you say you are a great businessperson, people will often want to believe you. They are attracted to success. And confident, unequivical statements often result in followers.

There is saying among con-men that postulates; "You can't fool an honest person." This means that the rubes want to be convinced. They want to believe that the pyramid sceme is a real wealth-creating venture. Why? Self-interest. It will make them successful as well.

And this example summarizes our dilemma. A pyramid sceme can indeed last a long time. As long as people are putting money in, it will appear to be successful. But it is not actually creating wealth. Thus it inevitably fails. But that only affects those who are left holding the bag. 

Those at the top of the pyramid may very well walk away richer than when they started. Unless they are bought to justice, they may continue with their appearences. So while reality inevitably bites, it doesn't bite equally.
