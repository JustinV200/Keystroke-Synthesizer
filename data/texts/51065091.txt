Optics are the strongest tools when trying to convince others that your position is the correct view, selling others on a product and/or motivating people to take actions. While good optics can be pleasing and make things easier to consume, too often they are used in nefarious ways.

For decades, or even centuries, beauty has been used to either gain profits or anothers time. From the use of designs to draw someones eyes to a certain product in a marketplace to the use of beautiful women to catch someones attention, one needs to be aware that you're being slightly deceived for anothers end goal.

In modern days, both have been used in the media to influence voters to believe lies or distort reality. This is a tactic used by all sides to draw your eyes in. The framing of the beautiful woman on your television screen is no accident. The use of makeup to make the anchor look almost unreal, almost angelic, is to trick you into thinking that they are of superior stock. When you combine this with the repeating of a position or a lie, it plants seeds of their truth in ones head. Repetition is key to convincing someone of a "truth".

Some would argue that it's just to make things more pleasing and that there is no deceit going on. They will also argue that if there is a lack of visual appeal, the information will have little to no appeal to a broader audience. It could be argued that having an unprofessional look would have the reverse effect and repel the desired audience.

Simply put, beauty sells and the market is more than willing to use every tool available. Regardless of gender, the fast majority of news anchors have at least a base level of a pleasing look. Any visual flaw one of them have is minimalised throught the use of makeup, camera angles, lighting and attire. This is no accident because everyone knows that this occurs. Combine a "perfect" package with half-truths and you have a dangerous weapon.
