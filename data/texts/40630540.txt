Around us, appearances are often mistaken for reality.  Ads for products and services, politicians, celebrities, media and public figures work to create favorable impressions that may be far distant from reality.  Many times, these images and impressions are created to cause the viewers to have a greater positive impression of what we think we see rather than what actually is.
  A well-known public servant appears to be an expert at creating false illusion, and conveying his opinions and wishes to certain members of the public.  These illusions have created a division of disagreement and hatred of others in a country unmatched by anyone else in recent years, all to the detriment of everyone.  While this country is known for its free speech and right to disagree, many outrageous statements and encouragements of rebellion can be very harmful,  even deadly, and this person's claims of being "right in all matters" is false and ridiculous, and, more importantly, serves to harm and divide.
  It's up to all of us to search and fact check the truth when faced with these types of situations.  We must consult and honor different valid sources to arrive at the real truth, not just someone's statements, personal judgements and outrageous viewpoints of their own "truth".  We are responsible to work and uncover true reality to serve the greater good of people, their country, and the world.  It's completely unacceptable to allow ourselves to be swayed by any one person's views, without checking their personal motives and gain.  I encourage you to search, and find the true reality!
