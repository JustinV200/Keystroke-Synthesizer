Images and impressions have tons of an effect on people for various reasons. One reason images and impression has tons of an effevt on a person is because that person can or is looking up to that person for example a role model or someone that they look up to when it comes to cooking or a public figure. In commercials or advertisments the company or the promotion team would get the consumer's attention by gaining traffic instead of showing the product and what it stands for.

In today's day of age, impressions and images can be decieving to some people and the team or the group does not try hard enough or put effort to really show or explain what are they promoting to the cosumer. People love to see what is the next big thing or what is the latest thing out instead of looking at other options because today's society is evolving and growing more into the digital phase. A person can also be influenced or inspired by the images to look like that person instead of being their true self.

A person loves being complimented by another and certain people love attention. Tons of people look up to role models or people that are big and want to be just like them. That's where I feel like some people don't have the ability to think for they selves and that's what holds some people back from being great. That's another major factor how images and impressions can effect other people. 

I can also say that it can effect a person's day as well. Their condifene won't be up to par because they worry about how good they should look or what that other peson is going to say. People should not let that bother them at all and should not be afraid to be their true selves. 
This is how images and impressions have tons of an effect on people. Some people are living up to unrealistic expectations on they selves.
