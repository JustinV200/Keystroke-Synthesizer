Materialism is a part of our every day lives, whether we want to believe it or not. Turn on the TV for even ten minutes and you will see advertisement after advertisement for all the newest and greatest items that one can possess. In fact, it is impossible to not be surrounded, and even indulge in materialism. Communication and survival make it impossible to not be materialistic. For this rreason, our society should not be criticized for being materialistic.

In our society, it is very difficult to do any task without a smart phone. A Smart phone is one of the items that many people criticize others for and many are called materialistic based off of the type of smart phone they have. However, in order to hold a job or to communicate with people around you or that you love, you need to have one. There are no longer any pay phones that are working. Many employment places post schedules and communicate through email or private apps. This is one exampl of how our society relies on materialistic items for communication.

Our society also relies on materials for surival. Think about it. You need a warm place to sleep. That requires some type of bedding, some type of blanket, something to sleep in, and a roof. All of those things are materials. We require food, which would mean something to eat it with, and somewhere to store it. We require clothing, which again is materials. Even the most simplistic family or person would need to aquire these items. However, many people are criticized for the love of these items. It is built into our very nature to want to have these things for surivial.

Unfortunately, the word materialistic has recieved a bad nap. For the reasons that I listed above, it is obvious how being materialistic is not a bad thing, but instead, a requirement for communication and surival.
