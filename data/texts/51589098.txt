My name is Andrew Furry. And I have an issue to present to you people; that is, the issue of false posturing in the advertisments of goods and services. The issue of things being not as they may appear when shown on a box or magazine advertisment, the issue, my friends, of some kinds of images and impressions having an effect on the people of my generation.

All around us, we are bombarded by the media. We are shown images of the rich and famous and the hedonistic lives that they lead. Always close beside these wealthy influencers are the products that they shill. Light beers, skin creams, cars, credit cards, and expensive under-shorts. The average consumer can not get away from these things without completely cutting themselves away from the internet, radio, printed press, or TV.

We see the effects. Families that can't afford a house buying a car that will be repossessed. Debt from credit cards and fancy schools. Drawers upon drawers of beauty products that will never see a second use. The media's sales tactics work.

Yes, you may say. But people have free will; it is their choice to buy into these poor purchases. Indeed, I say, man does have free will, however a contstant attack will break the mightiest of fortresses. 

All that I have left to say is this: we must be ever on the watch. Corperations and their shills in the media will stop at nothing, nothing, until they have every last penny that you have earned.
