Materialism is often seen in a bad light. People who engage highly in materialism are often viewed as shallow. While I can understand why that is so, it is my belief that what should be criticized is bad intent with material possessions that are acquired, as opposed to materialism itself. I think that what matters significantly more than making purchases is the reasoning behind the purchases being made. Just as there are materialistic people who can be manipulative, self-absorbed or evil, there are people who engage in materialistic behaviors for the benefit of other people. 

For example, consider a woman who is always going on shopping sprees. She is constantly buying bags, shoes, purses and jewelry. On the surface level, this woman may be perceived to be lacking in depth and frivolous with money. However, it is quite possible that this person likes to treat her loved ones to nice things. She could be a highly caring and generous person with a lot of depth who shows her love through buying people fancy items. On the contrary, another person could be very materialistic and instead of spending money out of kindness, makes purchases on guns with the intent to harm innocent people.
 
In conclusion, I don't think modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. After all, money has to be spent by everyone in order for us to have the things we need to survive. I believe that what should be criticized intsead is the immoral abuse of materialism. There are people with kind hearts who desire to have money and buy things in order to give to others. They use money as a tool to enrich the lives of others in positive ways. On the contrary, there are people who are constantly buying things in the spirit of selfishness or hate for others. Materialism can be positive or negative, depending on the character of the person engaging in it.
