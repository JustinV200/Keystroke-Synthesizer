Materialism, is it a good thing or a bad thing?  Can we have too much of a good thing?  It depends on the mindset of the reason for obtaining the material things.

Material item, can indeed, make us happy.  The feeling of a new car or piece of clothing can give a rush of happiness or excitement.  How long does this feeling last?  That would be the main thing to consider.   Buying stuff can be likened to using drugs. It gives a high for a short time.  It does not sustain happiness and the consequence of it may even bring sadness.

Buying a new car is for sure exciting but what happens when the payments can no longer be made and there is a threat of repossession?  That would bring on the feeling of defeat, saddness and sometimes depression.  Maybe the true happiness is knowing you CAN buy things within the means of your income and with no reprocussions of losing said things.  That is only for them to say, it is not for society to judge and criticize how one spends their money.

Understandably, there are those who can spend and spend without thinking about it, but are they really happy?  Is it the amount of things that make them happy and if it was all taken away would they still be able to find happiness in anything?  Only they know and it is up to them how they want to feel.

It is best to focus on our individual lives and not try to judge and speak out on others lives.  No one is perfect and we have no idea what is actually the reason behind what people spend their money on.  As the old saying goes, "worry about your own doorstep before you start sweeping off others".
