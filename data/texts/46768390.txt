Happines is a very subjective term as it can vary from each person on this planet since we do not share the same outlook on life. Some people might find happiness in something that we night find stupid or unimportnat. It all depends on how one perceives their individual reality and how willing they are to protect what makes them happy. 

Some people believe that they can only be happy if they pursue their own personal goals and look after themselves to their hearts' content. They don't need to look after others or share their happiness with other people in order to feel happiness. This is why they might be looked down upon by society. Society loves charismatic people that can put themselves out there with other people.

On the other hand there are people that only find happiness by serving others. They don't care about their personal happiness or personal gains. They feel happy by serving others and making others feel happy. One such example was mother Teresa. She never pursued her own happiness. She devoted her entire life to the happiness of others. All she wantedwas to see other people happy, because that's what made her happy as well.

I believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals over the happiness of others. The world is filled with many different people. You can't please everyone no matter how good that sounds. If there's someone that's really grateful for what you've done for them, there wil be someone else looking for the ulterior motive for why you've helped them. It's impossible to please everyone. And it can backfire and take your happiness away sometimes. So I believe it's best to not take others' matters into your own hands because more often than not, things get dirty.
