People achieve more success by cooperation rather than competition because cooperating with the colleague helps us with so many things such as sharing knowledge and helps to increase production and innovative.  cooperation with others helps us to increase the level of understanding of other person ideas.

But most of the people are basically competitive in nature. competition motivates people or teams to be better, stronger, smarter and faster. mostly competitive people are more self oriented which they like to compete with others. but it will not be effective on overall production of the particular organisation.

People with competitive mindset can achieve more success in school and colleges because they like to compare themselves with much more intelliegent kids. so there will be only learning among themselves. Therfore it results in healthy competition. But it is not suitable for industrial sectors.

people with cooperation achieves more success than the competiton because more than one or two minds of the people are working together than competiting between themselves. for example, a group of people playing soccer. all the members in the team should be cooperative  than being competitive between themselves in order to win the game. likewise so many examples are there. 

Always people with cooperation achieve more success.
