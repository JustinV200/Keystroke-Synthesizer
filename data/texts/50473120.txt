          Happiness definately comes from focussing on your own goals. The only person that can make you happy is you. If you set goals for yourself and achieve these goals , hapiness is the reward. These goals don't have to be big. They just have to be for you personally. One persons goals are completeley different than any one elses. Not everyone starts at the same spot in life , so they wont reach goals at the same time. And you may not have the same goals as anyone else, and that is perfectly ok. Everyones happy doesn't look the same.   
        Some people may say that you can achieve happiness from others, From doing things for others, from helping others, from money, or the perfect job, from the perfect house... But you can't actually be happy for someone else if helping or doing for others isnt what makes you happyor having all of the material things that society says we should have to make us happy. It all has to start with you. You know what makes you happy. You can definatelly make other people happy. And for some people making other people happy does make them happy, but not everyone. Some people are happy by making others miserable. 
     We are human. We are all made differently. You can make everyone in the world happy but if your not happy then whats the point. You can make yourself happy and other people happy at the same time , If you surround yourself with people who are like you. Thats how we become friends, Having things in common. But true happiness comes down to you and only you. You are the only one who can make YOU truley happy. Your goals, your life, your happy.
