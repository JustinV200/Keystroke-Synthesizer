Images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. A lot of things that are advertised are not exactly what you get when you purchase the item for yourself. This is all too common in our society, and people need to learn how to not be tricked.
All the time on TV, we see commericals for food, clothing, alcoholic drinks, and things of that nature. The commercials include people having or consuming said product, while having a good time with others and being successful in what they are doing. This creates a favorable image of the product and makes it seem like it will improve your life in the same fashion. In reality, eating fast food will not inherently increase the amount of friends you have or make you more popular. Fast food is more likely to increase you cholestrol or clog your arteries. But fast food is not advertised in this way. Some may ask, why would fast food companies promote their foods as super fatty and unhealthy and make them unappealing to the public. To that, I would say that both companies need to be more responsible with their advertising and people need to do more research themselves in order to not be tricked by this. It would take the cooperation of both to create a more reality based advertisement.
There are steps that can be taken as a consumer to not be tricked by the false advertisements you see on TV. You can do research on the product to make sure that you understand the good and bad of it without the window dressing of seeing it on TV. Asking experts and others more knowledgabel than you is another way to get the full truth. It would be nice to see a whole societal change towards more of a truth based advertisement sphere. That would be the most ideal scenario for consumers and would keep them safe from inaccurate product performance.
