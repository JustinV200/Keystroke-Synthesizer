Cooperation and competition have been around for a long time. There are some people that likes competition with others, while other people like to cooperate with others. To get a job done successfully, it really takes people cooperating well with others. Competition can be vicious and can be hard for some people to lose. We cannot always be winners on everything we try and do. 

Cooperation has both give and take efforts. We must be able to listen to others reasoning and explanations and try to accept there decisions on things. We must also be able to explain our own reasonings in order to help better our group. Cooperation takes getting along with others and trying to be as respectful as we can be when others may say things we may not always agree with.

Competition can be good for one and can be bad for others. Some people think that everything they do must be competitive like with others and they want to be the best and win every time. There are times our best may not be good enough. Whether we are first or last in competitions does not make us a good or bad person. 

It takes many types of people in this world to either be cooperative with others or continually wanting to be competitive with others. I think our life and work environment would be better off if we could cooperate and work together. Cooperation, not competition is what would make this world a better place.
