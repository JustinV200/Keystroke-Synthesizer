I never do an effort to do image and impressions on people in my normal life. But when it comes from my carrier side definitly I do some effort to made my image and impressions. because If I am in  the state similar to my daily life They never recognize my effort because they have a belief one person who has a knowledge means they sholud made an effort to show to his/her higher officials. So I am also made some image and impression to show off my talents. but I did not anything over I just show want I am do.
In current trends one who all around us appearances are mistaken for reality. Clever advertisements create favourable impressions but say little or nothing about the products they promote. In stores,c olorful packages are often better tahn their contents. And in the media how certain entertainers politicians and other public figures apparence is more important than their abilities. All too often what we think we see becaomes far important.         
I agree with that above, in current situation people from all working areas are now workes on their own to made a good image and impression among people to ensure their sales rate percentage.
