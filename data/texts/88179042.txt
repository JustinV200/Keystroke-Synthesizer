The saying goes that "money can't buy happiness." However, at least according to my experience, it's much easier to achieve happiness without the constant pressure of financial burden. My position is that a certain amount of materialism is unavoidable in today's society, but as with all things, should be approached with moderation.

One of the biggest stressors on people in today's society is dealing with finances. One of the leading reasons for divorce is finances, or difficulty in dealing with money management. I personally feel that acquiring more money, at least in my case, is more about living comfortably and providing for my family than acquiring more stuff. To me, materialism is most insidious when one becomes addicted to the pursuit of more and more things, that aren't necessary to one's daily life. Another danger is in pursuing material things as a status symbol or a way to keep up with others.

A counter to this argument might be that people in extreme poverty manage to find happiness, whether through religion or through relationships. I would argue that a person in that situation would find their life significantly improved with the acquisition of basic necessities, and the ability to live comfortably and help others live comfortably as well. 

In conclusion, materialism in today's society is unavoidable. As long as that materialism is used to provide for one's family to live comfortably, and not in the meaningless pursuit of useless things, I think materialism can be a healthy part of a modern life.
