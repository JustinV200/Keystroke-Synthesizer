Modern society should not be criticized for not being materialistic. 
Materialism is the love of money and spending it for pleasure and leasure. In the modern world people have become materialistic and it is a symbol of status in the society. I believe materilism has made people to be more creative to raise their bar and   maintain a certain class that is deemed to be superior than the common majority of the population.

The conservative members of the society however tend to believe that materialism is deviating from the enshrined cultural values and beliefs. I  tend to disagree with this ideology because the modern world is changing and it demands for change of the way of life, this compels the population to adjust to suite the current trends. 
Technological advancement is a example of  inevitable change in our modern society that dictates continuous adoption of new trends. This comes with a necessary cost that    an individual has to meet in ordere to remain relevant. Secondly, humans tend to be associated with the latest fashion designs such as clothing and they end up spending alot of money to satisfy their needs to keep up with the modern fashion trends and remain relevant in their social class.

I therefore conclude that being materialistc is the way of life and it is inevitable in the modern society.
