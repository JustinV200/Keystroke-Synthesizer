Some people think that happiness is depend on pursing things, some think as happiness lies within money but few people consider their happiness as others happiness.  Happiness comes from making other people happy.  Eventhough our own goal is important for us to create our identity but making others happy makes our own soul happy. By making our envrionment filled with happines ultimately  lead to fullfill our won happiness.
     
     Happiness lies within the hand of ourself. If  we fulfill our happiness it does not have any kick in our life but fulfilling other people happiness makes ourself a worthable person.  Fullfilling our happiness only lost for few years but fullfing others happiness last for whole life.  It added value to our society. People around us give more respect to those people who values the happiness of others.  

    Great leaders consider the happiness of the nation as a happiness of themselves. They did not think about their own happiness so that we called them as leader. If they were think about their own happiness they will not consider as a leader in our history. Improvement of human society will automatically increase the happiness of the nation.
