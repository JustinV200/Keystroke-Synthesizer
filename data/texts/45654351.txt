Is what you see, really what you get?  Are you drawn in by that bright shiny package in the store?  That celebrity that seems to have it all?  The perfect figure, the right amount of money, the right car, house or clothes?  Are you buying into the whole package that advertisers are trying to sell us to keep us buying more and more products that don't really do the things they advertise?  

It is time to step back and think for yourself what you want and need, not what the world or at least the advertisers are telling you will make you happy.  Do you really need that new pair of expensive tennis shoes? Are they really going to make you faster on the basketball court or help you jump higher?  If they do, then buy them, but let it be your choice, not some gimmick that is promised that will leave you disappointed after you spent your money.

But, all my friends have it and I need it to be cool.  Is it a need or is it a want?  A need is something that you have to have for survival, a want is something that you desire but is not necessary.  Be clear in your mind which it is, a need or a want, before you purchase an item.  That way, you won't be disappointed when it doesn't live up to the advertized line that was fed you.  You need to take control of what you consume and use, don't let others make up your mind for you.

Stop being a follower and become the leader!  You decide what you use and how you use.  You study and research the product and determine if it will fulfill the job you have for it in your life.  If it doesn't check all the boxes you have made, then pass it by!  This will empower you to be in control of your life and not be controlled by the things that are constantly shoved at up by the media or advertizers.  Once you realize this simple truth, you really will be free and feel that you are making your own choices.
