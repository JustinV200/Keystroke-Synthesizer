Being materialistic has had advantages and disadvantages for society. It's brought progress, but has reached a point where the disadvantages probably outweigh the advantages. Our desire for goods and posessions is causing widespread destruction. It's caused the extinction of numerous animal species and may cause the extinction of the human race. 

Materialism has driven humans to innovate, to make existing goods ever better, and to produce goods that have improved the quality of people's lives in many ways. Our lives have been enriched through the beauty, fun, entertainment, and meaning that the objects in our lives provide. The production of enjoyable objects also provides people with purpose and a source of income. When I think about the joy that objects can bring, I think about my parents who both enjoy collecting various things. My mother enjoys collecting dishes, dolls, and figurines. My father enjoys collecting diecast cars. It's not just the objects themselves that give my parents pleasure. The outings to find the objects are fun for them, and it gives them something to strengthen their bond.

As enriching as objects can be for people, materialism has reached a point where it's now causing more harm than good. We are depleting resources in our drive to produce the objects we desire. We are destroying the habitat of animals. We are polluting the environment. The destruction of habitat and the pollution is decimating animal populations, and has completely wiped out some specifies. Materialism has added to global warming. We must reduce our materialism if we are to save ourselves and prevent greater and greater destruction of plant and animal life.
