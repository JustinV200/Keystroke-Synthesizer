People who are living in a society wants the others to respect them. They want the others to think good about them. They are ready to do anything for that. They are investing more money on lot of things to get fame infront of others. In this modern world, the society likes these kind of people only and want to live in their shadows to get rich along with them. The technology also developed a lot, anything can be easily achieved with the help of it. Inventions are helpful for doing the tasks easily without the usage of human power, it has negative effects too.

Those who have money are getting these modern materials with the help of money. It results in the reduced body activities and they are getting many health problems in the young age itself. They should do the required activities of their own instead of seeking help from materials. They are depending on vehiches even though the distance is walkable. They are spending for these activities and then spending in health recovery processes as a result.

In my opinion, this modern society must be criticized for being materialistic. These things should get stopped for the sake of future generatiions.
