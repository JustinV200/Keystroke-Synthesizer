    The question asked here is do images and impressions have too much effect on people. I would suggest that the asnswer is they affect people as mush as they are supposed to. People have evolved as social animals that use the behaviors of those they see around them to decide how to behave for themselves.
    As children, we look to our guardians to see how to take care of ourselves. Most of us needed to be shown how to bathe and brush our teeth. Not only for our health, but so that we will be accepted by others. We also look to others to figure out manners and courtesy and the rules of social interactions. It is natural that this behavior of learning to be a part of the group by doing the sames things should continue into adulthood. Everyone does these thing no matter who you are. 
     These things said, everyone also has different combination of images and impressions they have learned from. This means that everyone has a different viewpoint on what others are doing also. This also means that some people will decide that others are doing things wrong. For example, suggesting that people are putting too much stock in one aspect of their life or another because it does not seem important to themself. 
     We all think that some thing or another is more important than it really is to somebody else.  The point is about what is making the individual happy and feel included in the group they want to be included with. People associating themselves with others by way of what those others are doing is one of the most natural things people do.
