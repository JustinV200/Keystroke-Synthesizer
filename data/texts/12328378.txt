Happiness in itself is something very personal. What makes one person happy may not make another person happy. Do people tend to find happiness through more selfish goals or selfless acts and pursuits? That's a question that is important and tells us a lot about an individual and society in itself. 

Thinking about your own life, I'm sure there are examples of both that you have witnessed. You've known people who are very selfless. Maybe a mother or a close family friend. They would do anything for anyone else and seem to find a sense of peace and happiness in that. By contrast you probably also had a friend who was just all about having fun and pursuing their own goals. They focused only on doing things that made them happy in life. It's very likely you've come across both of these types of people so that you can look at them and compare who seems more happy out of them. 

People who pursue their own long term goals in order to achieve happiness are people who would not find happiness in focusing on other people. And people who want to focus on the happiness of others also would not find happiness in just focusing only on their own goals. It really comes down to each person and how their perceive things in life.

There is no right answer when it comes to happiness. Each person finds happiness through different acts and pursuits so every case is unique to the individual. Happiness itself is universal. It's a feeling that is achieved by doing something that makes you personally happy, but the way you go about getting that feeling is never the same for any two people. It's impossible to say if either of these types of people are happier. The feelings of happiness they have are in theory the same, just the way they go about achieving that sense of feeling is really all that is different.
