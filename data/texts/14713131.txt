           Success in a competitive world. In our lives we feel that we sometimes have to compete to accomplish something in life, while that may be true, it should not cost us our dignity. There's alot of hate, competitions, rivalries, etc. Everyone wants to succeed especially in a work place. People want positions, GOOD positions, and to be promoted. Those who thrive and work their place up succeed, if you don't work, you don't get paid. In a game, if you don't run, you don't get to the finish line.

There is a limit in competitions and when it blows over there will be those who win or lose. There is a difference between competition in a work place and in a game. In a game, you compete with the other players and whoever wins succeeds. Try again and you might get a chance to win too. In a work place its all different. At work you compete to get promoted and there will always be someone who wants to replace you and take over your spot and that is someone whom you will have to face everyday and thats where hatred might be build up in the coworkers and that will bring consequences in a work place and can lead to failure. 

Cooperation is part of respect. At work or in play there is always a leader or a boss whom we have to follow the rules or instructions from in which we have to respect and in by doing so, we are cooperating. So as long as there is respect, there is cooperation. When in a group and everyone cooperates, great things can be achieved and maybe keep everyone happy. Working together and coming to an agreedment and mutual respect I believe anyone can succeed in the long run. Like in court when you go for jury duty, you don't compete, all the jurors have to cooperate to reach an agreement to help the Judge before a final judgement on a case. Cooperation in a competitive world will always win.
