Modern society is complex and ever changing, with different views and opinions and goals amongst different people. It is common today to see social media influencers, friends, family, and coworkers embrace different lifestyles than ones own lifestyle. Two of those lifestyles; being minimalistic or a maximalist, although being polar opposite of each other, should never be criticized in modern society.
Society has evolved and moved forward in so many aspects, and while society still struggles with prejuidice and judgement, it is important to always remember that everyone lives their own unique life and what makes one person happy may not make a different person happy. For instance, if you were to have a minimalist move into the same house as a maximalist, there may be some conflict in living choices. The minimalist will enjoy having few materialistic items, having open space and no clutter, while the maximalist will enjoy having materialistic items and showcasing them throughout their living space. Respecting eachothers lifestyle is important to continue to evolve into the best variation possible for modern society.
It is understandable to see celebrities and their showcase of materialistic items while others in the average working class struggle to make ends meet and feel that life is unfair and that the celebreties wealth should be less or shared. It becomes easy to criticize those that are materialistic when someone feels they do not have their needs met. However, the best way to move past the criticizism is to put oneself into the celebreties shoes or the shoes of the materialist person to see how they would live when they had the ability to purchase the materialistic items.
Modern society is full of unique individuals where different lifestyles make different people happy. Criticising a lifesyle that is simply different than ones own lifestyle is not a healthy way to keep society moving into the right direction.
