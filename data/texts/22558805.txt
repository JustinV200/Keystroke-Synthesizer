I believe images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. In sports for example, it can be "better" to show off rather than score. To make an opponent miss a tackle, but not gain any more yards. To make a defender fall down, but ultimately miss the shot. To pass the puck between your legs to your teammate, but miss the pass. Many fans of sports rave about the play, and will watch reruns laughing with their friends about how cool the player is, but the player in fact didn't help the team win during those plays. 

In the media, clips of political advertisements are used to pursuade voters to vote a particular way, but those advertisements do not tell the whole story. For example, they can be taken out of context. They can be used to smear a candidate. They can be used to impact the way a bill is viewed by voters when it comes to vote for it in congress. But most voters don't know what's in the entire bill. They only hear what the media wants them to hear. 

These impressions can make people think a certain way when they don't know the whole story. When they think it's cool to just make the highlight reel, but not do what's best for the team. That a clip that's posted to social media is all the information they need to hear about a subject. That being cool or winning an argument is more important than being knowledgeable or hard working. Because those things aren't going to land on TikTok. Those things are boring. Those things don't drive up views and gain followers.

They just change the world.
