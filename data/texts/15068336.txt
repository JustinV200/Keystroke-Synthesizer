 I think the power of sight is the most dominant in the human body hence most people are drawn to what they see. Prior to believing anything most people would like to see first. Its most times difficult to convince people on how something could be beneficial to the without physical proof hence the use of advertisements in the media by entertainers, politicians etc.
This is ironic because most times , especially after the purpose of the advertiser has been achieved, they end up not satisfying their audience as Americans have experienced in the political sector. This, sadly might continue till people begin to look beyond what they see.

Sight is a blessing that's turning to be kind of a curse too that we humans must learn to control instead of letting it control us. Most sages in stories are blind, ironically, but with so much wisdom. People (who can see) come to meet these sages for direction in life. Imagining  asking a blind man for advice! Recalling this made me say that sight can be a blessing as well as a curse. When humans learn to criticize what they see, then will we truly accept sight as a blessing. I hope this eventually happens.
