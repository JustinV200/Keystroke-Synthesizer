Happiness is the word that come from the mind and it is how the people rae happy in the world. It describes their mind , if they are happy in the life means all the things come with happy mood and entire life goes with it.
               The happy minded people can make others to happy, sometimes the happy mood come frome single smile. The people are restrcted to smile with others , they think that if others will not smile means it will be great insult. That is the main thing to decreased the smile on the people face. Sometime the happiness come from the work space or in the society , If the people attained their goal in life means there havey the happiness. Sometimes it will be in the happy people around them . in some family all are found to be happy , that is like the mind of the people . they did not bothered of anything and anyone . They enjoying their life moments only. They can find the happy mood in every area.
    In my opinion the happy mood come from our mind only. We can select the reason to be happy. If we are bothered of something means it will not happy at all.   The main thing that people could take all the things as much as good as possible. The it will be happy always .    In some cases the people take difficukties and suffer about the things and it cause to damage all the mood and they will be tensed all the time. Stay happy and careful always then the life will go smoothly.
