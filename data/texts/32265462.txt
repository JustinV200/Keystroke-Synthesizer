In today's world, it is often easy for social media influences to use their fame and fortune to manipulate others to beleive their own beliefs. Often, politicians, celebrities or name brands will reach out to these influencers in an effort to increase their own fame and/or company revenue.

Are these influncers causing more harm then good when it comes to our youth? Many will argue that these influences can be dangerous - as they have the ability to shape young minds or "brainwash" them into doing or thinking things that they shouldn't. Recently, these social media influencers have been using Tik-Tok as their ideal platform to encourage the youth to try harmful and often, fatal activties. Playing it off to be cool for the viewers to do such things such as ingest tide detergent pods.

How far is too far? I, for one think social media and influencers need to be heavily moderated, even if it means limiting their freedoms and amendments to speak their minds on these platforms. If you aren't using your freedom of speech for good - then, you should be deprived of such privelages.

I hope that parents and legal guardians are keeping a close eye on their kids and teens - to ensure that they remain safe and healthy while watching what they see influencers do on social media platforms. We need to work together to make the world a safer place for the next generation (not a dangerous one).
