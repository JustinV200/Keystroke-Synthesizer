The pursuit of happiness is a daily struggle we all face on a daily basis. Happiness can be found in helping others, reaching your goals/dreams or a mixture of both. My happiness can be found when I am with my family and achieveing my goals of one day becoming a role model in today's society. 
The reason for this happiness is based on what I have seen in my life not only in my country of origin Brazil but, also in America as well. The USA has brought me a good majority of happiness because of family. Family is an influential factor in everyone's life whether positive or negative. Life throws us curve balls whether a family is broken or not it stills plays a major role.
The pursuit of happiness is dependent on one's lifestyle and values. For instance: my child produces alot of happiness in my life and causes me to fight harder for my dreams/goals in life. Wanting something for myself and especially my family is extremely important for me.
To conclude, my happiness is a reflection on my how I view my life as a whole and all individuals should find what makes them happy. Regardless of societal pressures and influences. So I am not confident into determing how others view happiness but, for me happiness is found in helping others which essentially helps me focus on my personal goals.
