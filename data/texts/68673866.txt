Happiness is a goal that everyone has. I think happiness depends on a lot of things. Everyone is different and has had different experiences. 

I think people would be happiest focusing on their own goals. Most people put themselves first not other people.

We are only in this world for a short time. We only live once. I think we should grab all the gusto we can get. Everyone can focus on their own happiness. Who wants to sacrifice themselves for other people. 

I know there are some wonderful people like Mother Theresa who spent her own life doing for others, There are many dedicated doctors and nurses who worked during the two year covid period. These people are saints and should have our deepest admiration. There are also the Ukrainian fighters who are putting themselves at risk for their country that we all hold in high regard.

The truth is most of us aren't that self sacrificing and tend to look out for number one.
Still, we are all entitled to be happy and most of us are not dedicated to other people. Our instinct is to survive. As a kid, my theme song was Let the Good Times Roll. It still is. I am a boomer - a spoiled group and an american - a priveledged person.
