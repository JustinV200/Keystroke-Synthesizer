I believe that competition is healthy, but it has its limits, so I can't say it leads to more success. Personally, I'm more in favor of competition because I'm a competitive person, but I do agree that people who compete with others versus cooperation, can sometimes lead to people putting their self-interest above all else. Competition can produce great results when individual task are present, but I don't support it during team settings where some might be tempted to chase their own goals. I once dealt with this when my company recently gave bonuses to en entire team that performed well, but one of the members in the group was openly complaining about doing the majority of the work, but everyone was paid the same bonus money. You can avoid issues like these when you build a workplace culture that doesn't solely focus on individual accomplishments. I also understand how competitive people would prefer competition, even in team settings because they might see this as a way to motivate people to do better to recieve better rewards or praise, but this could lead to negative problems arising if everyone doesn't have the same competitive nature, which may cause some to not be motivated enough to produce the desired results expected of everyone in the group. In my opinion, I believe in the perfect world you want a little of both because competition has always been a great motivator, but you still need to work cooperation into the mix because individual accomplishments can be great self victories, but rarely are we in individual settings in public and relying on cooperation is usually key in most situations that we face in life.
