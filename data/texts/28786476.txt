"I see it, I like it, I want it, I get it." Those are lyrics to a hit pop song that came out a few years ago by Ariana Grande. This song highlights how much this world cares about materialistic things more and more. Most people are out to get the newest, the best, latest thing out there and it something I believe the modern society we live in today should be criticized for.

There are three reasons why I believe this. The first reason is because people will start to prioritize how they can make more money so they can get the newest thing and relationships and how we treat those around us will suffer. Not only will people who are materialistic judge others for not having as much as them but all their relationships will decline. They will be spending more time at work and less time with family. The second reason I believe that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic is the amount of waste that will produce. It costs so much to make things, and then they come in packages that creates garbage and waste and then if it's not the best thing anymore they will have to dispose of it. It's just all so unnesessary. The last and final reason is people will look to materials to make them happy. I believe this is arguably the most important reason I've stated so far. If people need more and more materials they will need that to be happy and if something happens and they can't buy the things they want to it can lead to depression. 

Some people may not think the same thing that I do and that is fine. Maybe they think that it makes them feel important. But if you really sit down and think about what is important in life, materials is not it. They are meaninless and are not there for you. The people around you and the experiences you have in your life, that is what matters!
