Actually for me, materialism is the thing that human likes nowadays, because money is the ultimate thing in our day to day life. Without money money we cant live or lead our regular life. Our whole life is fully filled with money. Our society see us only if we have money and stuff with us. They will respect us only when we have money.

If we have money our life will be more happy and meaningful. In olden days we beleive in spiritual world. but in modern world we see only money as god. Money is always seen as god.

Our society criticize to be materialism and people dont like to follow materialism in this modern life style. We need to be materialism for ourself, for our family members, friends and for the society we live. If we spend more money, we are critized by our people around us. They use to talk good infront of us and use to talk about ourself bad when we are not with him. this is our society. 

If we are good and take care of materialism, we can keep our family , friends and our society very happy and peaceful forever. Everyone should think of materialism in their life but not to be and follw that culture. We can get the knowledge from materialism.
It makes us hapy life if it is limited.

Spend money for good things and do good for people, people will talk about us but we should follow the modern society with spending less money and happy life. Our modern society is now following new culture called materialism. There is not feeling or love in their life. One and only thing which is going in everyone mind is money. Money is always ultimate. but we cant buy everything by money, thats love and happiness. If we spread love, we can lead a peaceful and happy life.
