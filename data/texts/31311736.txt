Happiness is subjective. Trying to understand what makes others happy can be a dauting task and this why people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals and dreams.

An individual is in total control of their happiness by pursuing their dreams and personal goals. If they have the ambition and drive to pursue their goals and dreams they will attain them and be rewarded with happiness . The individual knows what makes them happy and knows how they are feeling at any given moment throughout their life and cange the trajectory of the current situation.
 
The premise that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others is flawed. An individual who gives his spare change to a homeless person on the street is doing it because they feel sorry for them and obligated to do so. Compassion would be a better description of why someone gives their change away. Perhaps, for a moment, this act makes them feel happy but does it really change the situation for the homeless person who now has some spare change in his pocket? Did this act of generosity makes this person happy? Most likely not, so why do they feel happy about this random, fleeting, interaction with a stranger? We as individuals do not know what makes another person happy unless we have intimate knowledge into that persons mind.  We assume we know based on what we think we know. 

We live life one time. Focusing on what we are in control of and have the ability to change in our own lives is what will lead to happiness. Live life to its fullest, pursue your dreams and goals then you'll be rewarded with the happiness that comes with it.
