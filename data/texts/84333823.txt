We have all heard the saying that two minds are better than one.  Under the majority of circumstances, I believe this statement to be very valid.  To answer the question on whether people acheive more success by cooperation or by competition can be in the eye of the beholder and vary greatly depending on how one views success along with the surroundings and characteristics of each indiviual or group.  

I agree with the statement that two minds are better than one and for the majoriy of siutations and circumstances believe that people will acheive more success by cooperation that competition.  When people cooperatwe and share views and ideas with eachother there is more knowledge in the group and people can learn from one another.  The more people you have together, the more brain power you have, the more strenght you have, and the possibilities are endless.  

When people cooperate, tasks can be completed faster.  If we were all in competition with each other all the time, we wouldn't be as advanced in the world today as we are.  The world is made up of all of us and by working together better acheivements come about.

However, many people have opposing views from one another and trying to cooperate with one another can bring on negative arguments and physical wars which can also slow down progress and advancements.

In conclusion, success can vary greatly depending on ones views and thoughts.  There will always be those times that we want and feel we can acieve more by doing something ourselves, but in the big picture if we do not all cooperate with each other for most things, then we wouldn't be able to achieve things on our own. We all learn from eachother and teach one another new and exicting things and only together can we make the world a better place.
