What makes people happy?  This is a tough question and can be answered in many different ways, depending on who you ask.  I would like to suggest that true happiness is attained not by focusing on ones self, but by striving to make a difference and improve the life of others.

For example, look at how you feel when you give someone a gift that they have really been wanting.  The joy on their face warms the heart.   Why else would parents go above and beyond their means to give their children so many gifts on holidays or special occassions.  It has become somewhat common in society today to "pay it forward".   This is seen in simple everyday gestures such as paying for the car behind you in the drive through.  The person paying it forward doesn't get anything for doing this except the knowledge that they made someone else happy.  This knowledge, in turn, gives them happiness.  That feeling of joy and happiness is good for the soul.  It connects us as people and allows us to share a common thread.   That thread allows for the happiness to spread and evokes a spirit of respect and love in the community in which we live.   

There are those who will argue that focusing on achieving your own goals is what will lead to happiness, but that feeling is fleeting and cannot be shared with others.  I might be happy that you were able to accomplish running a marathon but that happiness is fleeting and doesn't have the same depth as that feeling on Christmas morning when my kids open their presents.  

This feeling of happiness cannot be attained by simply focusing on your own goals and needs.  We can take pride in our accomplishments and share them with those around us, but they do not bring the true happienss we all seek.  We need to be able to share a part of ourself with those around us, this is the key to true happiness.  The true gift of joy and happiness is in the giving, not receiving.
