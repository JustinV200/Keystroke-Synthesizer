Now a days advertisements are really influence the people. Advertisement is one of the important factor to buy a product. People really like the advertisement but they not really like the product. Peoples does not realise the reality they are living in a imgination world of advertisement. People really not need of some product but they buy the product because of the advertisement. Advertisement decide the need of the peoples. That is the business strategy of the corporates and the multi national companies. They underestimates the peoples.

                        How advertisement influence the peoples the answer is the persons shown in the advertisement. Companies knows that celebrities, public figures and some imortant persns are the model of advertisement and peoples like them very much. This is the reason for peoples buying a product without any need. They only like the person shown in the advertisement not the product. They buy it because the celebrity shown the advertisement they really like a lot of them.

                               Peoples do not think about what they want or what they need. Peoples only follow the advdertisements and the celebrities. Now a days we want to realise the reality to live peacefully. We want konw about that what we need. Live in the reality not in the imagination world. Live for ourselves not for the public figures. Do not be attracted to advertisements.
