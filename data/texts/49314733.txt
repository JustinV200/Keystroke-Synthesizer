Materiliasm over the years has been viewed typically as a bad thing. Someone might call you materialistic and you would associate that with bad meaning, however aren't we all materialistic? Do we all not consume the materialistic items this world has to offer? I don't think materiliasim is all bad, however it has just been used as a negative word in songs, media, etc.

Capitalism and materialism essentially go hand and hand and lets face it we all contribute to capitalism. Whether its purchasing clothes, food, or whatever it is you are contributing to capitalism and materilism. Even if you are purchasing organically safe products that is still considered to be materialistic. Many of us probably work for a company that promotes materialism so why do we view it as such a bad thing? 

I think people have got the wrong idea of what materialism means and I think a lot of it has to do with the way the word has been used as an isult throughout the years. When I hear that word the first thing I think of is the popular 80s Madonna song Material Girl in which she goes on to list all the ways we are living in a material world. This isn't a bad thing. Materialism and over consumption are two completely different things and once we understand that we can take back the negative meaning of the word.
