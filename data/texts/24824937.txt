Images and impressions have a huge impact on everyday life. Through instagram, facebook, tik tok, and other social media, you're bombarded with these constantly. If you have a smart phone, you can't avoid it. As a result, images and impressions have way too much of an effect on people.

If you open your phone to any social media site you're either going to see an ad making a product look good or someone living their best life. While it looks great, it can really lead to a lot of resentment, jealousy, and "keeping up with the Jones'". There are multiple aspiring instagram models or social media influencers who are willing to do anything and everything to try and make it big. Unfortunately these jobs are tough to get and can really make someone's life look a lot better than it really is. These jobs make look glamerous but studies have shown there's a lot of mental health problems that come with it and it's not entirely healthy to try and become one.

As you can see, images and impressions have way too much of an effect on people. It's unavoidable nowadays and as long as these things look glamerous and fun, it won't stop. It's important to be able to unplug a bit and live your life the way you want to live it. It doesn't have to meet anyone online's standards.
