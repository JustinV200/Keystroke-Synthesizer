Materialism

People fond in buying , owning and acquiring the properties. It is the important ingredients of happiness. Their quality, range everything decided by possessions. If they addict for that it can turn in a really negative part of life. It will affect the family, friends and all.

Some times we may say materialism is correct. Because for buying or owning the properties they are working hard and they are trying to achieve their goal. It will bring happiness , proud and joy. If we give proper important to materialism life is in our hand.
Negative 
But some times being materialistic is bad. because it leads to the mental pressure for others. it will create difference in the way people treat other human beings. The materialistic people hardly treat others. So, it is important for people to follow the equality among all. The problem occurs when material take a more important place than family , it will destroy our life . If we notice the richest person in the world , they are depressed and unhappy. because they could not spend time with their family.
