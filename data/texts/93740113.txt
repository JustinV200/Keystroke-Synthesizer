How people think of appearances compared to reality.
People always see the outer look instead of looking the internal quality or quantity. It makes easier to promote the product or thing easily when an individual looks or purchases the item. Like the same people also getting recognised by their appearances instead of their abilities.
Basically in a store when we go we look only the items which is colorful first and then only we think about the remaining things because they attract our attension. In the same way people also being popular depending upon their appearances when compared to their reality. so people believe that people or things are getting promoted only by their outlook not with the ability.
Always people get attracted with the colour, oulook and design of product packed or person instead of abilities. So everyone need to check the product features or the ability of individual to decide about their original standards.
Finally i want to say that products should be identified with their quality and quantity and the same way person should be identified with their abilities and behaviours. Since every product has its own features and every individual has their own capabilities. No one in this world is unique.
