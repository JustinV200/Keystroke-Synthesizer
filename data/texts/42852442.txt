Materialism is an issue that has been growing a lot in recent years. As people stayed home during the COVID-19 pandemic, they became more attached to their "stuff". Most people do not spend more time producing than acquiring more things. Society should be criticized for being too materialistic. 

There has been a culture shift in recent years that has made people more materialistic. People tend to simply look out for themselves, which eventually makes them materialistic. It becomes almost like a game to see who can get the most stuff. This extends even to younger people as well. Children often fight over who has the newest and coolest toys. This means that the problem of materialism will not be going away any time soon. The only way to stop it from happening would be to teach the value of togetherness to the younger generation. 

The argument against society being materialistic is that most people spend their time producing more stuff. It is find it hard to believe that's the case. Most people are not producing anything. Unless you're a farmer or something similar, you are probably not producing much. A lot of people probably do consume a lot, but it is nowhere near the amount of things that they keep. This means that the problem of materialism will just keep growing.

Society will only become more materialistic in the years to come. The problem needs to be addressed by parents or it will only get worse. Sadly, it seems like the chances of that happening are slim. Maybe once people start seeing the outcome of their materialism, things will start to change. Until then, society will just become more and more greedy.
