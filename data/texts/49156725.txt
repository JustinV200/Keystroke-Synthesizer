       Most people would scoff at the idea of needing to "have it all" in order to be satisfied in today's day and age. Most people talk about wanting to feel at peace and at one with themselves. Basically people just want to be happy, but what makes a person happy? Is it inner peace or is it material possessions? I believe people are inherently selfish and greedy. No one wants to admit they would take the twenty dollars they watched the person in front of them drop, but a majority would most likely do it. All you have to do is look to today's societal norms. 

        Everywhere you look, materialism is rampant. Online is a prime example of this. All social media is clustered with ads trying to sell you more, and people showing off their latest buy from Amazon. Corporations are using digital tools to learn preferenses and keep you buying forever.  You might try to escape with a nice quiet movie and tea, but then commercials pop up on your screen and remind you, you're never free. I made a comment to my mother about needing clips for my fingers to eat chips, so they wouldn't get cheese on them. A day later a social media platform I was using, displayed a product exactly like the idea I had in my mind.

 Do people really want to be happy? Do they want to "have it all"? What makes a person happy? Is it inner peace or is it just having a piece of the pie? It is very scary to know we are feeding this monster by our very own ideas and desires of each other and ourselves. We can't escape ourselves. I do believe people are selfish and greedy. Of corse people are inherely materialistic. If they weren't, there wouldn't be so much to possess.
