 Materialism is essential in a capitalist modern society because most people spend their lives acquiring material in exchange for their time.Furthermore, is impossible for the humans in general not to be materialistic due to the inherent greed and desire for more and so there's no need to criticize anyone for being materialistic.

 If you ask anyone what they want ,90 percent of the time they will say money or something that can be bought with it.In our mordern capitalist society we are but wage slaves,which means that we are slaves to our own needs and often desire for material.Let's face it,there is almost nothing we can't get if we have the money so materialism is commonly associated with money.

 Some people may disagree and say that "money or material can't buy happiness".I would ask them to take a look at previously poverty stricken families who received donations and were able to acquire more money by other forms of aid.You will find that the money brought them great happiness indeed.

 As I mentioned earlier,greed is inherent in humans.In fact our capitalist society is a the biggest catalyst for our greed which makes us much more materialistic then we would have been otherwise.Everything from our basic neccessities to our recreational wants requires material:there is just no way out of this cycle of greed and materialism.

 I would like to conclude that there is no justification behind criticizing modern society for being materialistic.The inherent human greed was fueled by our capilatistic society resulting in the society becoming more materialistic.
