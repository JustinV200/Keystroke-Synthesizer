Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? Absolutely they do. These days we are all bombarded daily with content and ads telling us what we should look like, that we need to change, eat, not eat, etc. They tell us what our skin should look like, what our weight should be, change all of these things about yourself to fit into this little perfect bubble over here because someone somewhere decided that that's what perfect is, and it's really disgusting that this is what the majority is tricked into believeing.

Growing up in the 80's, we of course had no cell phones, no social media. We lived life outside and in the trees, in the dirt, and away from this constant reminder that weren't "good enough" according to whomever makes up all these ridiculous rules. Kids these days only know this way of life of phones and social media and constant bombardment of ads and all of these influencers shoving products down their throats all the time. All they see is people their age doing all of these things, and travelling, and spending money and being told you have to look like this and have this, and so many of them can't see how fake it all is. They can't see that all of these photos are heavily photoshopped including these "travel locations" and these "perfect" bodies and makeup on the girls, and how these influencers that tell you that you have to have money and things to be worth anything. 

I feel very lucky to have grown up without all of this constant, in your face being told that "hey, you're just not good enough".  These things were still around back in the day as well as they always have been, but at least we can p
