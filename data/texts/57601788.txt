    "Happiness comes from the core" is what my grandma used to say. Focusing on your own dreams and goals is what will make you happy. While it is true that helping others can make you feel happier and be a better person, it is hard to be a helpful person if you cant find your own happiness to even get out of bed in the morning.
    First of all, think about how much a doctor helps people throughout their lives and you must think "well helping people like that must make him happy", well the doctor had to find his own happiness in medicine and go to college as well as medical school and take up residency which means he has already worked on himself and made it to be a doctor to help said people all day. Pursuing your goals or dream can give you a feeling of accomplishment, we all know that it is great feeling to achieve. Even knowing you have a ways to go but are still sticking with it can be a confidence boost and overall help achieve more goals.
    On the other hand,  focusing on the happiness of others can get you stuck in a loop of ups and downs because you cant help everybody and not everybody wants to be helped. Even if you believe you are happier helping others you can't be happy not puting yourself first. You have goals and dreams equal to that of others remember that!
    In conclusion, Pursuing your goals and dreams can make you an overall better person, a more helpfull person, and even a happier person. So i guess happiness does come from the core.
