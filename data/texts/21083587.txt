I don't believe there can really be a subjective comparision of cooraperation and competition.  People general respond differntly to challenges, and how they approach the completion of goals as well as the stakes involved.  

Those who gravitate to competition, in my experience, tend emphasis on "winning".  They are wired in to gage their worth in how their accomplishments campare to others.  They tend to take more responsiblilty upon themselves, while at the same time may be little sceptical of the motivations of others who offer help. For many like this, the feel of being a failure can be more of motivator than to potential pride of winning.  This can be much more stressful, but when it results in a "win" then elation can feel much more earned.  There is also the sensee of contral one feels when competing.  There is no one to blame for failures other than one's self.  

Cooraperation, on the other hand, has it's own benefits and roadblocks.  One has to give up a certain amout of autonomy.  The pride of a successful completion is spread around to everyone in the group, while the sting of failure can be muted.  Blame can be passed around.  The stakes just aren't as high.  But the benefits, which can be.  Having others to bouce ideas off of and testing one others approach can be extremely helpful to avoid pitfalls, which can lead to a much more effiecient procedure.  There is also much greater oppertunity to specializing.  Team members can focus on the aspects of the task on which the are most proficiant at, instead of trying to be a master at everything, which is jsut not stastainable.  Often the success of any cooraperation may not be as intense as a single competition, but be more rewarding because it is shared, and enjoyed with your team members.
