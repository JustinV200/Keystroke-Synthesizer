I was a teenager in 1980s, and I sang and danced to Madonna's "Material Girl" on many occasions. What I visualized in my mind at the time, probably because of the song's video clip on MTV as well, was a girl with lots of tacky jewelry, latest fashion (which translates to trashy these days) clothes, converse shoes, sporting a really puffy hair. 

Metarialism is beyond Madonna's song, it is beyond owning what is on trend. It is also owning for the sake of owning. Not for survival, not for well-being, not even for prestige. It is owning for the sake of owning, because that gives us some kind of fullfilment. The feeling of ownership fills something in us. 

Here I ask myself, what does it fill? I think it fills what humans have lost with modernization, urbanisation and technology. There was nothing more important than spring solstice in Europe after a harsh winter that, the start of spring became a celebration of survival. There is nothing to celebrate anymore when winter ends, my kids will not die during winter, even if they get sick they will survive. One can talk about so many examples from very different cultures such as this one, when people were highly affected by nature, when people were, in fact, a part of nature and their survival but also happiness and well-being depended on it. 

People are good at filling what is lost with something else. Materialism, I believe, filled up the emptiness when the sense of naure left us. One can write about the negative effects of materialism pages and pages, and probably those arguments would make a lot of sense even if they were not completely correct. It does not change the fact that, materialism is a need, it needs to fill space in us which was left empty when we lost the sense of nature.
