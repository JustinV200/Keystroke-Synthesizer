  I believe it's a good mix of both. As in most things in life, finding happiness is not black or white. If it were then we would all be happy. I personally feel I currently need to focus more on the "focus on personal goals" part first. After I've filled that cup a little I think I, as well as others, will benifit more from the "focus on others happiness" part. I tend to try so hard to help others and please others and make their lives easier at the expense of my own, hurting my happiness scale. 
  Hitting personal goals,no matter how small, help my overall mental health which helps me tip the happiness scale in my favor even for just a little while. Some days showering; washing my hair, good scrub down of my body, and fix my hair is all I can muster so those three little things bring me happiness. "I did it!" is a pretty great feeling. Every little or big personal goal brings me some happiness most of the time which gives me some happiness to share. When my happiness cup has enough in it to share and I help others filltheir happiness cups it inturn fills mine up a little too. 
  So my answer is both. Start with yourself and then branch out to others' and the beautiful cycle of happiness will have such a great chance of continuing. Happiness can seem so rare somedays I think any tool is worth trying to get some.
