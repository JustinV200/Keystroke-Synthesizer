Cooperating with one another is a sign of an advanced society. In every endeavor, whether it be a sporting event or an attempt to cure a disease, groups of people working toward a common goal far outweighs the results of individual effort.

I feel that joining together with my fellows in the accomplishment of a goal not only strengthens our bonds with one another but it also showcases the potential of the human mind and the miracles it can achieve when working in  tandem with other minds. While it's true that individuals often arrive at astonishing results when they apply themselves to a project, history shows that most advances that have improved society have been conducted by groups.

I feel the reasons for this are readily apparent to even the most casual observer. In all those areas where great strides have been made, one only needs to look at the origins of the accomplishment and, more often than not, a group will have been involved rather than an individual.
 
People point to great scientists such as Galileo and Einstein and contend that individual effort brings far greater results than working together but they don't look at the bigger picture.  The great ones come up with amazing theories, but then groups take over and find equally amazing concepts within those theories and apply them.

Working together will bring us a far brighter future than struggling in the dark as individuals.
