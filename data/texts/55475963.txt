Society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Materialism is a way of life now. Especially in this day in time. It is apart of our lives, rather we want to admit it or not. Materialism can be seen as something positive instead of something negative. Materialism can help everyone reach certain life goals.

Materialism is a way of life now. It is a part of our daily lives. Everywhere we look, espically on social media, we see people spending money. They show off their cars, homes, and labels. They are proud of their accomplishments and they sometime purchase expensive gifts for their success. I personally don't see anything wrong with this. 

I think that materialism should be seen as something positive instead of something negative. I don't think there is anything wrong with people being excited about their accomplishments. Sometimes, people on social media seem to worship materialistic things and this can be a problem. But as far as being excited and proud and sometimes showing off, is goals.

Materialism can help others reach personal goals that they may have. By seeing others accomplish materialistic goals, can help push others. This is a very positive thing. I think that sometimes society gets so caught up in things that doesn't make a difference one way or another. Society will try to make anything a problem.

In conclusion, materialism isn't a negative thing. If we could focus on more important things and not get caught up in things that don't matter, the world would be a better place. I feel that materialism is the new normal.
