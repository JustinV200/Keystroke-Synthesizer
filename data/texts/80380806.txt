    Success can be measured by many things in this world. We all can find success in many different ways and every person is fuled by different things in order to achieve what we consider success.   Weather it be interal or external factors that help drive us to acheive better. Every body is fueled and motivated by different things.

   Some people such as introverts  seem to be more interanlly motivated and just need  to challenge themselves and make their own goals and standards to drive them to succeed. Or they may be looking for things such as a certain producivity goal, a raise or even just as simple as reconization from a boss.
  
  Other people however are more so fueled by competition and being the best they can be and leaving their co wokers " in the dust'' or so to speak. These people are more so the extraverts it seems to be. This gives them the motivation to see the others around them and try to be better, more productive, work more hours, have higher accuarcy, every aspect they can find to try and be the best at what they do. It seems people who are more so fuled by these factors do not seem to care as much about the financal aspects of being the best but just the knowing of how they really rank within a company.

   Working together is a good place for both these type of people to come together for a common good  to get the desired task done. During this cooperation there can still be competition but they have to use it as an advantage and use it to go for the end result that they have in mind.
