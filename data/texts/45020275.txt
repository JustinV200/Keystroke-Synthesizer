The pursuit of happiness is the goal that most individuals have, but never achieve. It is a difficult goal to achieve and pursuing the happiness of others opens up the possibility of reaching that goal. By helping others achieve their goals, there is a sense  of selflessness and acomplishments that fullfills individuals. 

Attaining happiness is a difficult process for many, with multiple challanges, however happiness is not so black and white because there are multiple examples of over-achievers who seek therapy for their lack of happiness. These individuals pursue their personal goals and even when a goal is achieved they are not fulfilled. Happiness is not only about focusing on oneself, it can come from helping others on many different levels. Many may say that personal success makes you happy because it can bring wealth, accolades and stability, however these things also contribute to stress, anxiety and depression because we don't always know when enough is enough and oftentimes people in high positions feel isolated and alone, which brings down their levels of happiness. 

Happiness has more to do with living a balanced life where one can pursue personal goals, while contributing to society. If given the extreme of pursuing personal goals and focusing on helping others, one may see that the person that chooses to help others feels more fulfilled in their life choices than the rich person focusing on themself only.
