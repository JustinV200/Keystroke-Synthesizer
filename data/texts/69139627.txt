Nothing makes a person happier than when they see someone else smiling and being less concerned with lifes problems.  It's a good feeling to help others, so in turn that makes me feel happy. 
    
      Now others may say what's the point in helping others if it doesn't benefit me? They think if it's not for their own benefit there's no point in doing it. I say the feelings you get back from others is just as good, maybe even better, than just thinking of yourself.  If you just think of yourself you shut out other people and in the end you may end up alone. That's not a good feeling to have, so in essence you've shot yourself in the foot by earlier actions you took. 
    
      The best way to live is by including others in your lifes goal of happiness, and that's a great way to live life. You will be happier, other people will be happier, and maybe you just might make the world a better place to live in. For you and future generations that come after you.
