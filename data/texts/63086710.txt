I do believe that not everything is as it's appearance makes it seem to be. For example, a product that is advertised as the latest and greatest miracle to erase all wrinkles from our face. It makes us excited to try this product, after all it has so many positive reviews and pictures showing us how great it is. Everything we see and read is meant to be very impressive and urges us to try this product and tells us we won't be disappointed. We will sometimes see everyday people, just like us, used in advertising, or sometimes movie stars that look perfect after using this product. 

However once we spend our money and purchase this product we find out that it has minimal impact on our wrinkles, or if it works it is only temporary and works for only a short period of time, or leaves some unwanted residue. The product never works as it claims it will perform. The information we are given for this product is never complete and only tells us the information that is meant to make this product look good. We are never told about the adverse effects or told the number of people that bought this product and are unhappy with it. I think we all know in our mind that these products do not work, but from time to time we are lured in and find something that we just have to try. These products are bound to wind up in our box of products that don't work and that we are sorry we ever bought. 

Things are not always as they seem, but we are constantly bombarded with visions of products, ideas of politicians and perfectly beautiful movie stars. These are all illusions, all wanting our attention and our support or money. It is our job to weed through all the promotions to find what is really important to us and to find what really matters in life. This can be very difficult at times but it is important that we not waste our time on products or people that really won't improve, or add to our life.
