Here we discuss about how people succeed by cooperation. In cooperation we can get help from one person to another. If one person is financially strong and an another person is skillfull by cooperation they can achieve in any Business. They both can support each other they can form a team for them, by that teams cooperation they can level up their business in short term.

But in other hand Competion doesn't give a healthy growth. If two business started with competion means they both pull one another legs in business then their both business will suck and then they both can't attain their sucess. Competition wont be healthy at any cost in any business. In competion they cant even form a team to attain their goal, so that they cant get help from others and they cant even Share their ideas with others.If team forms with competion means it will only endup with arguments

In Cooperation Team work can be done smoothly. Openness, Trust and Honesty is the Valuable benifits in Cooperation. We cant get these kind of valuable things on competition.
so that at my level of mind I thing coopetion is the best thing in the world to achieve Sucess not only in business, In sports also we cant win a game without cooperation.
