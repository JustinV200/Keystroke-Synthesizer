Superficial qualities have become too important in today's world. We have seen over the years how it has gotten worse and worse and is impacting each generation more. This is leading to unhealthy behaviors and is impacting more than just the minds of the public. It is also leading them to put their physical health at risk.

The culture of worshipping influencers and celebrities with impossible proportions has gotten so prevelant that we don't even consider it odd anymore. The fascination with celebrities that are famous for being famous makes this worse. Take the Kardashians. For some they are just a guilty pleasure that is harmless. But for all too many they are an impossible ideal that is meant to be copied. It is one thing to want to dress like your favorite celebrity but trying to completely achieve their body style can be dangerous. 

It can be argued that it is normal to want to look at certain way and to look up to famous people. But this sort of worship has been taken to the extreme. The Kardashians have been criticized for promoting weight loss methods that are dangerous and are not methods that they use themselves. They have been criticized for misrepresenting what their actual natural appearance is, and claiming not to have had cosmetic surgery or use filters. This can lead young women to think that they are less than good enough because they do not look the way their idols do, when the idols in question don't even really look like that. And many women choose to get poorly regulated surgeries like brazilian butt lifts or injections that can put their lives at risk, just to emulate the curvy figure of Kim Kardashian.

It is okay to appreciate the aesthetic of something. But it is also important to realize that there is more beneath the surface. Your favorite model or celebrity is probably not just blessed with good genetics, it is a carefully cultivated brand. And in the end, reality is better and safer than an impossible ideal.
