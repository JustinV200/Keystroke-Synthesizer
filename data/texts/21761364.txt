the answer for the question does the people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition in my opinion is both cooperation and competition. For success both of these is necessary. This is my answer in my point of view.
           I would like to explain of those two in seperated way. first I would like to choose competition to explain. first my point is when there is a competition between a single person or a group of people then the individual who likes to get success then by the competition he or she can win or get success through competition. 
                Next I would like to explain about cooperation here cooperation means support in my point of view. when the surroundings of an individual i means parents and friends and relatives and others who supports or cooperates the individual to get success or achievement in their field or anything an individual gets or tries to get success or achievement. In another point of view  cooperation in the sense when an individual cooperates him or herself to do something to get success. these both comes under cooperation.
                 I am here justified my answer I guess. Again both competiton and cooperation is necessary to get success. This is my answer.
