Way too many people live their lives focusing more on the happiness of others than themselves. Unfortunately, I was a victim of this situation for a very long time. From my experiences, people are mroe likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals and happiness rather than the personal goals and happiness of others. 

Seeing yourself grow and become better, is one of the best forms of happiness you can experience. Growing and becoming better as a person takes a lot of practice and self-discipline. It always seems as if we always know exactly what to say to others for them to cheer up, but can hardly come up with ways to cheer ourselves up if we are upset. Another thing I have noticed from my personal experiences is that others never put up the same amount of effort you put into helping them.

I do not believe you will find happiness aiming at something other than your own happiness. If you are too busy focusing on other people's happiness, you will never have time to worry about yourself and become better as a person. Learning to love myself and better myself was one of the best lessons life has taught me, and I cannot wait to see how far it will take me.
