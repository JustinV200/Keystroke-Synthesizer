Oh, look! That is nice! Do you love it, need it, and have to have it? Let's get materialistic. Industries come out with new things every day. From automobiles to fashion to the latest in culinary delights, everyone seems to want to buy the newest thing. Honestly, is that a bad thing or just a thing?

There are those who adhere to the mantra that less is definitely more of what one should want or have. Brave souls have forged their lifestyles into the wilds, growing their own food, building their own houses, and teaching their children at home. They wear used or homespun clothing and would not dare buy anything new. I admire those who can adhere to those self imposed rules. I like a good deal on used things myself. However, I like a lot of used things. Does that make me materialistic? Probably.

Many people find joy in shopping and accumulating things. Some may say that is a false sense of happiness. I suppose to some degree it is. The joy for our things often fade. Although, many of our things bring back memories of different people and times. That is what we really want to hang on to. So, we shop some more for what makes us temporarily happy, in order to make more memories that will last.  Seeing those things, wearing those clothes, brings those memories right back to the forefront of our minds. That, in turn, makes us happy.

Is materialism a bad thing? It keeps people working. Some work to manufacture what we want to buy. Some work to sell those things. Some work to deliver our many purchases. Others work to remove all of the excess trash we have from all of those deliveries. All of us work to buy more and more and more. It is what we have become: A civilization of people who want things. I cannot in good conscience criticize that. I am much too busy shopping online. I have found lots more things that I love, really want, and just absolutely must have. I know they will make me happy.
