People are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others. It is easy to focus on one's own goals but in the end even one's own goals end up bringing happiness to others. When we are young and entering college or even the workforce, we focus on our personal goals to motivate us through learning and expanding our knowledge. At some point along the journey of meeting our personal goals, we realize we are not happy with our earlier decisions and often times have a middle life crisis. 

During this middle life crisis, we often take a look at what we can do to make us happier but often times realize we have raised our children from infancy to childhood, perhaps into adulthood, and we want to give back to our communities and be a help to our society. If we have not picked a career or personal goals that fulfill those desires, then we want to make changes to our careers or to what we do in our spare time to meet those goals before our end.

Our personal goals will actually be met even as we strive to help make others happy because we are social creatures after all and want others to be happy too. As we strive to make a sales quota or sell products or save a person's life, we will find a way to communicate with others to meet those goals which will result in make others happy because we may all of different goals but they are often times similar in nature. 

We want to be a help to our communities and give back to society to help us fill complete in the end, which really means helping to make others happy. So when we are young, we should find a way to turn what think of as personal goals into goals to make others happy. So why just focus on the happiness of others at the start because your personal goals will happen during the process of making others happy?
