As much as i understand and know that most  of the  people in our planet are trying to buy happyness . And most of them think it is the only way tobeing happy. But i think this is not a way. yeah sometime own happyness is good enough, but for pure and clear happyness we must need to include happiness around us .
when a human being try to make happy himself it iwill never possible for all the time. we can not never fulfil our demand . But it is very much easy to help other people to fulfill their demand. when we will learn to fulfil another people demand , all of us will try same thing , and at the end of the day, the result will be , we are all happy buy other person.
I think this should be the motivation for all kind of people, ''live for other , other will live for you''.
There have lots of needy people around us we can make them happy very easy , and if we try to do that , we will notice their happyness. And i think this is the holly happy .
there have nothing beautifull to make other people smile and happy. 
I think, all of us need to try make other people happy , which is affortable and esy for us. 
if we can start the earth wll be more colorful and full of smile and happiness.
