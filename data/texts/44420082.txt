                          Competition and cooperations these are likes two side of coin. These two havw good and bad things and qualities. Competition means the only victory of a person others will fail in this situation. In the term cooperation a group of peoples cooperates for thier needs and they together.

                                       In the term competition means that the success of a person and others are the enenies of that person. In competition here makes ego and complex. In competition people do not discuss with others they only believe in thier own opinion. Peoples think only thier own victory they do not bothered about oters feelings. Competition create complex world between person likes siblings, friends, family members and others.

                                       Cooperation means that when people joined together that will make a wonderful victory. In the term cooperation peoples share thier ideas and thought others. This will helps choose the correct and right disicion. People do not not bothered about thier own victory in cooperation they nly think that the victory of thier team. In cooperation peoples share thier feelings with others and this is a great relief of some persons.

                                        In my opinion cooperation is better than with competition. The reason for this in the term competitions speaks that a victory or success of asingle person and others will fail. This makes a new world of ego and complex and peoples think that all others are thier enemies. This os not good to our society. But cooperation makes a wonderful world of togetherness and peoples share thier feelings with others. Cooperation helps from a person to overcome in the worst situation of his life. In cooperation we have a huge number of ideas and thought that will makes choose right thing. I strongly believe that cooperation is better than competion.
