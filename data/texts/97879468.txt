Can more success be measured by cooperation or competition? Collabaration and conjugation or rivarly and stridently?  Which can more success be acheived with?  The answer is through, cooperation, the team always comes first.  As great as one person can be at something, only good can come from positive collaboration, really regardless of the competition.

A basketball team for one example, has one great player who goes on and scores 50 points, puts up great numbers, but the team still loses the game.  That positive performance was essentially wasted with a loss, and only through powerful cooperation, can that the true end game be realized, be that as it may, only through excellent cooperation, regardless of the compeption, can true greatness be realized. 

A waiter whose really good at his job can make great money, but he can make more through powerful collabaration with the assisstants, the cooks, hosts. While such matters could all be handled by said waiter.  He would be more successful with the help of others as he can tend to other matters.  However; a restaurant with too many waiters for example forces competiotion between said individuals, which can lead to some people wanting to work harder, to take more tables, to make more money.  In this, case it can be said that both is needed but one drives the other.

In conculsion, only great things can come from positive cooperation, yet both are needed to truly be succesful.  Competition is essentially what drives the people to cooperation.  Their always a greater chance with greater numbers.
