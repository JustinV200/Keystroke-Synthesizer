People generally experience more success by competition than by cooperation. Success is something we all strive for. We work to be the best we can be at whatever we are involved in that interest us. Some make it a daily task to be better than they were yesterday. But there is something more powerful than outdoing yourself everyday. The idea of being better than the next person is what drives people the most. 

Like competition, cooperation certainly has its advantages. Working with others to achieve certain tasks and playing by the rules to do so can surely be rewarding. This method is one way of achieving success, but it will not be cooperation that takes a person to the next level. Success through competition will require glass ceilings to be broken, normalcy to be thrown out the window, and new and creative ways of thinking will always be necessary. 

To compare competition with cooperation is pretty simple. Cooperation keeps a person from improving. There is nothing wrong with it, and it can be an effective way of working. However, competition will drive a person to think at the next level. In order to achieve success in this way you must be better than the next. It will always take us out of our comfort zone, but it is the most rewarding method once it is achieved. This is why competition will always produce more success than cooperation.
