As each year passes so does the style and mannerisms of people evolve. The younger and younger crowd is constantly pushing boundaries when it comes to dress and appearance. Oldschool norms aren't valued today. What matters is results. Can you effectively do what is needed to be done? Ones image has little bearing on how productive they may be.

We are as a soicety consistently becoming more educated and progressive. We understand now that as time evolves, so does the way people think, act, and dress themselves. A first appearance means less now than it did before. You are only as good as the results that you put forth. If someone does a great job at work, why would one care how they present themselves? The youth recognizes that and values the ability to do so. 

In a labor driven market you have to cater to people and that is exactlty what is happening. The youth recognize now more than ever they have the oppurtunity to dress and act how they want. They recognize that a first impression doesn't mean as much as it once did because over the long term they will produce consistent results. What matters is performance and effort, not how an individual chooses to present themselves.
