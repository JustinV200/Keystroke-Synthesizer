I believe people are happier when they focus on the happiness of others. Some times just the smile on a small child's face or a stranger on the street is actually the best reward.

I have never had much in my life. I've never had too many people to look up to. However, the people I remember most in my life are the people who volunteered to be there. I remember the people who volunteered at the Salvation Army when I was a child. They always greeted me with a smile. The always appeared so happy to be there for me even though they never had to be.

Now, as an adult I try to always find ways to help others. I donate to toy drives, donate clothes, volunteer with the Girl Scouts, etc. It always makes me happy to see that I have made a difference in a child's life. There is truly no greater feeling than seeing a child open a present from "Santa" at a school Christmas party and knowing that you made that smile appear on the child's face. It's the most heartwarming feeling I have ever felt.

Another point would be that good deeds are contagious. If you help somebody, it makes them feel good. This would encourage them to then help somebody else and so on down the line. I believe if we all just make an effort to do atleast one good deed every day, then this would be a much happier place.

If people just focus on their own happiness, then people won't want to be around them. They would be too focused on themselves to ever enjoy time with others. This would lead to nobody wanting spend time with them. Then, this would make them even more unhappy.

Therefore, I truly believe that people will always be the happiest if they focus their time on the happiness of others. I believe that everybody should be kind to each other and allow happiness to grow all around them.
