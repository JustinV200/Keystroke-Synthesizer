 Civilization has long prospered and strived to make advancements for the people and the planet. Wether it be for hedonistic reasons or material reasons, people have wanted experiences. The experiences that one might work towards are specific to the individual, but overall can be seperated into these two categories. Those that want to enjoy nature, outdoors, or helping others. Others will gain their happiness from actual possessions.

  When it comes to wanting, materialism can come with negative connotations from outsiders. Is that really the case though? I want to explore and provide reasoning onto why it's okay to want material possessions and why those possesions can make a person happier and healthier.

  Materialism is basically wanting something physical instead of an outward experience. A nice car, a new tv, a house, a phone can all be put under this category. People like to sometimes have these items to show off and be up to date with technology. The end result is the same though, the person is happier. They know they worked hard for the items they have. They also will feel good about their status from the objects they own.

  Now it might be said that materialistic people are shallow and lack empathy, but that just isn't true. Materialistic items are very personal to the individual and does not change how they interact with others. They can still be helping, caring, compassionate people. The person just derives personal happiness from the items they have and that makes them content. There is nothing wrong wanting tangible items instead of other things.

  I hope you can understand my point of view and can learn about how other people cope and live in life.
While materialism can be negative, it is mostly keeping a lot of people sane and happy. Everyone should be able to live life how they want to as long as it doesn't negatively affect others.
