Unfortunately, appearance matters.  Does it necessarily matter more than content?  For many, yes, that is so, although not for all.  Forwarding someone else's work to your social media connections just to receive likes and shares is an example.  But the recipients' reaction, i.e. to like and share unoriginal content, is no different.  Many times it becomes very apparent that content does not even matter since a 3 minute long video may receive likes and shares in less than a minute of sharing.  The resulting image of several hundred or thousand likes and shares makes the user popular.  Images certainly have effect on people.

Whether such effects are too much is subjective, and often context related.  If someone makes an impulse purchase of a pack of candy just because the exterior looked fancy, and then finds the actual product to be sub par, then the effect could be mild irritation, but not necessarily too much.  On the other hand, if someone looks at doctored images from a past event and gets riled up enough to join an active, and possibly violent, resistance movement, then that could bring death and destruction to people, properties, nature, etc.  It doesn't even have to involve politicians or public figures.  Personal friend circle is enough to wrought damage.  Such an effect is definitely too much.

Every society laments the good old days of yore.  I do too.  However, I still believe it is an objective observation that superficialness of some of today's human inteactions is no longer benign, and could not be ignored as juvenile banter or simple amusement.  Many of today's vacuous sales pitches have real effect on people and our earth.  So yes, images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people, and to be specific, rather too much of negative effect.
