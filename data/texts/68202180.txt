Materialism is a concept all of us are familiar with and have encountered at one time or another. A phrase that is heard often, therapeutic shopping, sums up our feeling about spending money and buying more possessions.  It gives one a feeling of elation and excitement, often helping a person recover from a negative experience.  Endorphins are produced when shopping and spending money, that make one feel content and happy.

Materialism is not a negative thing, in and of itself,  As long as materialism is balanced by generosity, it can be a positive thing.  Some of the benefits of materialism include supporting the economy by shopping at large retailers and small businesses.  This, in turn helps keep unemployment low, by providing employment opportunities.  

Critics of materialism cite that spirituality, creativity and generosity cannot exist in a materialistic world.  They state that the pursuit of material goods overtakes all other benevolent pursuits.  

The fact is that we live in a world where money can buy not only necessities, but luxuries, that provide us with comfort.  However, materialism does not necessarily occur in a vaccum.  Many individuals with money and many material goods also participate in activities that are beneficial to the rest of society.  They donate to charity, support the local economy and participate in other benevolent activities.  Materialism does not need to have a negative connotation,  Balanced with generosity, it is a driving force in the world.
