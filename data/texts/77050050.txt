          In my view the modern society is criticised for being materialistic.  and also it is to be criticized only. Now a days people giving too much of importance to materialistic things only. they dont give importance to people,time,emotions etc. In old days people give much important to time and love,but now it is opposite. they think buying or gifting materialistic things give happiness to them but it is not, it wont give that.
          We should try to change it. we are buying too much of material things,some times we dont have need of some products but for prestiages issue people buy it. it is one of the worst thing.we want to limit our needs.even i am one among the people who criticize  the people who are being materialistic, because i value living organisms not the materials.
           Consuming more material things wont give happiness on sometimes, so make memories with people, dont give much importance to materials.modern society changing the ancient habbits,routines etc. in recent times only being materialistics is criticized and blamed because in recent years the usage of materistic things for prestiege is higher. in my point of view being materialistic is wrong, society also criticizing it now,in the end material things dont give happiness like humans. avoid consuming it more.so the society should criticize more for being materialistic only.
