All too often, people rely too much on images and impressions when deciding what reality is.  Successful marketing campaigns are meant to encourage the viewer to see a person or product in the most favorable light.  

Camera angles can even be important.  Suppose a person is sitting in a chair and wants to appear more powerful.  If the camera is placed lower than eyesight, even by several inches, the person will appear stronger, more powerful and as someone who should be looked up to.

Colors and lighting are often used to create desireable feelings.  Often colors are brightened up, highlights are added and flaws are often erased entirely.  The fair doll that is supposed to fly through the air on her own is really being held by a little girl.  Oftentimes, the hand that is holding the product will be ereased entirely.

Photo editing programs are very easy to use and are available as apps on phones and computers. Blemishes can be removed, longer hair added and even slimming a waistline are very easy to accomplish.  Video editing and deep fakes are very commonly used for interviews or promotional material.  

There is a common misconception that what we see on tv is real.  This is a very dangerousand naive way of trusting the media.  We've all seen the amazing effects that are done in movies.  Are we to expect that the same technology is not being used by marketing and PR campaigns?

We should accept that with today's image-enhancing technology that what we see has been edited to make us believe that perfection is reality.  Unless we see something in person, we are probably being manipulated.
