There is some question as to whether people find happiness from the pursuit of personal goals or from focusing on the happiness of others. While both of these things can lead to happiness in their own way, it is important to determine which one leads to a more lasting happiness. It has been found that people find the most lasting happiness from focusing on the happiness of others.
People can find a more lasting contentment from volunteering in the community and helping make their places of residence better for all people who live there. Just volunteering an hour or two a week will make a person feel like they are a part of something bigger then themselves and will give them an increased feeling of support and oneness with those around them. While some might say that pursuing personal goals is more important, this type of happiness is only temporary and the person will quickly return to their base happiness level after a short amount of time. This will make happiness alude them as they pursue ever more lofty goals. Plus, once they reach a goal they can't achieve they will be disappointed. Though it is important to have goals and aspirations of one's own, this shouldn't be a person's primary drive in life. The most fulfilled people are those who work in human services fields such as non-profits or charities, where there whole career is helping others improve their place in life.
As you can see, there are many ways to find happiness in life. However, the only true way to find lasting happiness is to make your focus external and pay attention to helping others. This leads to a more long-term level of happiness that a person can build upon and lead a more fulfilling life.
