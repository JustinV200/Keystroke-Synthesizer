     Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people these days. We live in a consumer driven world that pushes images in our faces all the time. We can not do the most basic activity without having images placed in our way. It is hard to escape the harmful effects that these images cause. 
     Think about your daily rountine. You get up and make your breakfast. All of the packaging that your food comes in is cleaverly designed to advertise the product and make it look appealing. Next you may check your social media, which is notably flooded with images. These images are often heavily edited and are designed to make the poster look better than in real life. These images that we view can often cause us to feel less happy with our own reality. 
     When you go to work each day you are also surrounded by images whether you walk, take a train, or drive there are billboards all around you. These advertising images are designed to get you to act a certain way. They tell you where to spend your money and what to buy. They tell you that you will be happier just like the person in the advertisement if you have a shiny new product. All of these images are designed to influence and control us. 
     We are driven to consume due to the constant bombardment of images in the media and in our daily environments. The persistant consumption of these images is contributing to keeping people poor by parting them from their money. We live in a time of wealth and plenty, but many people are living paycheck to paycheck due to this continual overconsumption. 
     The effects of these images has had a profound affect on our mental health and happiness as well. We are constantly comparing ourselves to edited images and wondering why we are unhappy with ourselves. The world would be a much simpler and happier place without all the fake advertisements on social media and all the product promotions everywhere you turn.
