We are constantly surrounded by advertising in today's world. Phone screens, television screens, and computer screens show us products and experiences in bright tones and with popular songs. Reality can be blurred in these images, and create an alternate view of these products or our lives. 

Often in media advertisements, celebrities tout the benefits of a certain lotion or perfume (among other products). Beautiful views of cities known for their glamour set the backdrop as the celebrity is draped in silk or jewels, promoting the idea of luxury or romance rather than the actual effects of a product. The price is almost never shown, leading watchers to look up the company online. When confronted with the reality of the price, most normal consumers aren't able to meet these standards. 

Online, one can never escape advertisements. Social media ads are embedded into our feeds, whether promoted from the app or even by those you friend or follow in a promoted or sponsored post. The monetization of society in this manner has shaped the way we interact on social media. Often, social media profiles can be considered a type of advertisement for ourselves. We market ourselves on these apps, only showing the best and most exciting moments of our lives. Editing and thought goes into most posts made, and they often don't reflect the lives we lead every day. 
 
The world shown in advertisements influences our everyday lives and interactions in the media age. It shapes our online personas, which can lead to the shaping of our in person lives. We count on the images we recieve to set the tone for our fashion, health and beauty standards. These remain ever changing as products change with trends set by celebrities who are out of touch of the reality of middle class Americans. Images and impressions create a false reality that we live half lives in with our true reality.
