 Materialism is a part of our culture whether we want to admit it or not. Madonna even has a song about it. In recent years, minimalism has grown in popularity and materialism is frowned upon. But there is a difference between liking and enjoying things and being greedy. Buying and acquiring things you like and enjoy shouldn't be looked down on and long as it's done within means and not done excessively. 
 Some hobbies rely on acquiring items to help you improve. Hobbies in the arts involve some level of supplies and you have to buy some things like canvas and paint to pursue your passion. In a different way, retail therapy can truly lift a person's mood. While it shouldn't be used in place of human connection, it is true, finding a nice outfit or a good book can make you feel better even if it doesn't solve your problem. 
 There is a saying, "money doesn't buy happiness". But this statement is often spoken by someone who is financially secure. For many people living in poverty, money doesn't buy happiness, but it does buy food, clothing and shelter. Those living in poverty often worry about acquiring the possessions necessary for survival. It's a simple fact that acquiring possessions shouldn't replace relationships with friends or family, but it is critical survival. Once those basic needs are met, buying things you like ultimately makes life more enjoyable. 
 Materialism is a part of our culture and while it has a negative connotation, it's not necessarily a bad thing. If the things you buy add joy or meaning to your life, that's great! It doesn't matter if it's a favorite snack, a library of books or a collection of sporks. The important thing is make sure the items you buy will be used or enjoyed by you or someone else and you go through and clean out regularly. (That's a lesson I've learned the hard way.)
