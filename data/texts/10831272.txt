Advertisements and looks are important to some people in such a period. For example, the majority of corporate company owners have many people who want food and other equipment but home made food products and handicrafts are mostly disliked. Advertising is  important  in today's life   but some says looks are not important to make a real statement. But the statement is wrong and in fact we also adapt to these time. Many are thriving on social media by pretending to be a good people. Don't trust  them and know its reality and follow and support real people. It is better to find fake people and not walk in their path or follow their path. Everyone should make his own path and walk in it and not ne limited by one's appearance. Because many sages are real life swordsmen, for example an Abraham Lincoln's father was also a shoemaker. But his son Abraham Lincoln's was the 16th president in our united states. so don't be fooled by someone's mlooks and appearance and just because someone lives a real life does not mean they are simple, they can be great characters too. It does not need pomp and publicity. So, we should know what we think we see becomes far more important than what really is.
