  Is having a desire for Material things been imporant throught history?  Throught out history people have been collecting and a massing their personal fortunes.  Even going so far as to owning other people.  I would argue that even the lowest in societies desired to better themselves by gathering some meager belongings.

  Looking a the records we can see that slaves, even as property themselves and counted toward the wealth of others, might have had their own possesions.  It could be some thing as simple as a bowl, spoon, or cup.  Still it was something that they could possed.   In their eyes they might also consider themselves well off if they could obtian additional clothing, or maybe shoes.  

  Furthing the arguement that even those with limited freedom can be materialistic take a look at inmates.  They also desire to accumulate things. Be it a book, or perhaps some photo, or other means of entertainment.  Haven't we all seen a homeless person beg, or hunt and collect things?  Their collection will be small becuase they have no where to keep it but on themselves, yet it still exsists.

  The world is filled with those that want something more then what they have.  Finding that something by working for it, foraging for it, or having it given to them.  To be better off, one step ahead of where they were the day before is their desire.  The desire to survive or the desire to have?  Look at it as the Desire to survive.
