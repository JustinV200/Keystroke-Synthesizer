The sense of reality in which 'representation' (as posited by Guy Debord and the Situationists in Paris in the late 60s) has replaced substance, is in my opinion, the inevitable symptom of the late stages of the western capitalist adventure, and analogous the late stages of of previous historical civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Romans.  

This phenomenon is clearly visible in nearly all forms of media and cultural expression.  Commercials featuring the voice of Walt Whitman are used to sell deodorant.  Kerouac's image sells cheap foreign-made khakis.  The visual tropes of the 20th century avant-garde are appropriated to hock the most brutally banal of items. Computer generated imagery creates lush, cinematic scenarios in which snack items, made by unhappy, underpaid clock-punchers in a factory outside Pierre, are depicted, in advertisements costing untold dollars, as somehow relevant to our quotidian existence or having some deeper meaning beyond their own purchase in our collective thoughts. 

On social media, millions of people, both consciously and unconsciously, artifically construct versions of themselves, or avatars, which appear to live seamless lives full of style, happiness and beauty through the use of filters, well-timed photographs/selfies, and the trappings of life lived remotely via the meta, distancing frame of reflexive commentary.  

In conclusion, I would quote the Chicago Arts Ensemble by saying that "organic being in the world must be re-established as the locus of reality, placing the virtual back in its proper place as simulacra".
