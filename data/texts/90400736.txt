Materialism is a love/hate fact of life. Some people buy things to feel better about themselves or to fill a void. In moderation this isn't a negative. Over consumption is where the problem lies. That is why people hate materialism. It's not that it's just stuff, it's that there's an over abundance of unnecessary stuff.

Life cannot be all about work. There needs to be a balance. Consuming products helps maintain the ability to not burn oneself out. At some point in the grand scheme of life it became more about work and less about enjoying the fruits of your labor. People became unhappy. Those that turn to materialistic items get a nice dopamine hit that usually never lasts longer than a day so they buy more stuff. Repeating this process can lead to debt. That debt then leads to more unhappiness and the vicious cycle endures another round. Meanwhile all this stuff piles up and eventually makes its way to a landfill. That is not good for anyone as there is only so much garbage this earth can hold. I understand that money makes the world go round but maybe it's time to give it a break. Stop letting greed dictate the future of mankind.

Materialism should absolutely be criticized but it needs to be addressed in a way that people don't tune out the message. Balance needs to be brought back so people don't feel the need to buy their way out of their feelings.  Work needs to stop being the all consuming beast that it is so people can be happier. A well rested and mentally healthy populace is a benefit to us all. That's where innovation thrives. Working people to death so they can buy more stuff so some CEO can die with way more money than they will ever need will be the downfall of man. Modern society has become unsustainable.
