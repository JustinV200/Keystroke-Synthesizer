People can find happiness if the world around them is in perfect harmony with their mental and physical state.  People can achieve this happiness through the pursuits of goals they have and by finding emotional support from loved ones.  Some find happiness along the journey while others find happiness while reaching the end of the journey.

So how do people find happiness along the journey of life?  Some people will seize the day and enjoy every waking moment that life has to offer - they take in their surroundings and enjoy things like spending time with family, helping those less fortunate, being outdoors, participating in their hobbies and participating in social activities with friends.

Other people find happiness when they reach the end of the journey.  They achieve that happiness by completing important things in life such as finding a spouse, having children, retirement, winning in sporting events, completing hobby collections and achieveing their dreams of checking off their lifetime bucket list of things they wanted to do before they pass away.

There is one common theme to people finding happiness that you will see by reading the previous two paragraphs.  People may find happiness on their own but the one thing that stands out for people who have achieved happiness either through their journey or completing the end of a journey - both things involve sharing that happiness with other people.

In the end people may think they are finding happiness on their own.  But in reality true happiness comes when that happiness is shared by including others in their happiness!
