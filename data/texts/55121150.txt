One of humans main goal is to be succesful in life. Yes, being educated or having a trade is a big component to being successful, but there is also something else that plays a huge role into the success of people. This would be the appearance of the person. Not only to appearance play a huge role in the success of people, but it also plays a big role in the success of products in the world. People tend to let images and impressions have effect on their feelings about people/things. 

No matter what we do or where we go, we are always looking at something. It is hard not to look at something and form an opinion about it. However, is our opinion about something always right based off of the appearance of it? If two people walked into a job interview the one whose appearance was appropraite would get the job regardless of who was more qualified because the image makes a huge difference. Yes, it is important to maintain a good appearance, but when is appearance not always everything. There may be a reason why the person isn't dressed in a fancy suit for the job interview. Possibly, he/she doesn't have the money yet to buy one. People tend not forget that other factors play a role in appearance. 

Even when it comes from buying things from the store, people tend to put too much focus on the image of the way something looks instead of what the product acutally is capable of. Oh it's in a fancy package, so it must be better, or this famous person uses this so must be better. This isn't always true. The famous people are paid to promote the product, which doesn't make it a better product. That is just the image that is set for people to see. 

In conclusion, people need to take more time to look deeper into what it really is instead of what it appears to be. There is so much more that we are able to learn and see if we actually take a deep look.
