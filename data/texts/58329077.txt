I look at this in both ways when it comes to society being too materialistic. We all been told our whole life to work hard and hard work will pay off. So I feel that us as individuals we deserve to buy what we want on the basis of working hard to get the things we want in life. 

On the other hand, I believe there is a lot of envy and jealousy in our society. I believe people that become successful and have a crazy amount of money that most people will never see in their lifetime, accumulate so much "stuff" that it is incomrehensible to most people. I believe Hollywood is a good example of this point. Majority of society does not need to live in a Mansion with 24,000 square feet which inclues 10 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms.

I believe there is a huge wealth gap in our society. I think children especially now a days have a lot of pressure put on them to have the best of everything which is not possible. It will always be the wealthy people agaist the nonwealthy people. Children need to learn that they can't always have what they want.

I don't think we should be actually criticized for being too materialistic afterall we all work hard for what we got. Maybe though society would be a little bit more kind if we appreciate each other instead of focusing on what the Jones's have next door.
