Appearances are something we've been socially constructed to care about ever since we stepped foot on this earth. It means to fit the social standards of what is "attractive" and preparing oneself or a thing in that standard to fit into society. People would say something like it does not matter, but in fact, it is what matters the most. People always judge things based on first impression. And first impressions will always be based on looks and appearances. People market things by making them look attractive, people present themselves as what the society would consider attractive. Because at the end of the day, looks do matter no matter how much one wants to deny it.

Social contexts matter a lot in terms of what people or society itself might find attractive. But in most cases there will be a generally accepted beauty standard in terms of what society thinks men or women should look like. For men, being muscular and big and in charge with a charismatic personality is what the society has largely decided as the "standard". For women, small petite bodies, with eurocentric facial features and a reserved and quiet personality is what is accepted as the beauty standard. 

People like to deny the fact that images and impressions have an effect on people because 20th century liberals would like to debate that looks and impressions dont matter and your heart is what matters the most. Which is a lie in most cases because to appeal to a person you need to make yourself presentable and likeable for the first impressions to be good. If right off the bat they think of you lowly it will never work out as they already started having a negative image of you. So images and impressions to have a large effect and I think it is for the best.
