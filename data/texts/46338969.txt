People are definitely more happy if they follow their personal goals. Reaching your goals is what drives each person and gives them the most happiness in their life.

The reason I feel this way is because everyone is an individual. What makes one person happy may make another person miserable and vice versa. So it is up to each person what goals they want to achieve in life and to pursue them as best they can. While the happiness of others can also cause some people happiness, it may cause jealousy, envy, and angers in other if they do not feel happy or successful in their own lives. That is why I see achieving personal goals as more important in the chase for happiness rather than looking for happiness through the happiness of others. I do not feel that a person can get happy seeing happiness in other people unless they are just as happy with themselves and what they've achieved in their own lives.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that people are more likely to be happy by focusing on their personal goals rather than on the happiness of others. Each individual should choose personal goals based on their interests and do all they can to achieve those goals.
