Happiness is rooted in loving others and working towards changing lives for the better. It's important to work towards this achievement in life. A better quality of life will be enjoyed by following this guidance.

There are many ways to accomplish this goal. One could volunteer to help others less fortunate, help with improving our planet, show compassion to others and love animals and the earth. Sometimes, all it takes is to smile at a stranger or help a child. Looking at the bigger picture, help to improve what you are able. One doesn't need to focus on gaining happiness; doing the things aforementioned will provide the path.

Many might argue that the only way to happiness is being goal oriented. This is untrue. In making a goal, a person becomes isolated and alone. Only through relating to others can one be truly happy. If there is no one to share joy with, then happiness is lost. Being goal oriented doesn't insure happiness, it seems to encourage self-interest. Achieving a goal does not guarantee happiness.

Being open to others and showing kindness is essential to happiness. Sharing what you can and caring about the welfare of others will help to bring light and love into one's life. Knowing that one has made a difference by emanating love and acceptance will manifest in true happiness. Enjoy nature and life, and bring love to the world.
