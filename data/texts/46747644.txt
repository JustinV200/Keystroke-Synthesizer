      Success can be measured through different lenses just like fashion captured through a camera lens but appreciated individually. 
 
      As a whole, I believe more success is achieved through cooperation.  Every individual is unique and brings their particular viewpoint, creativity and skills to the group to promote a common goal or achievement.  More can be achieved though the amalgamation of different ideas and perspectives to bring new ideas to fruition and having multiple individuals working towards the same goal. This is the reason why corporations and other organizations achieve success by pooling their ideas and experiences even though the vision may be driven by a single person or the initial idea may have come from a single person's inspiration.  In the end, more can be achieved with many working together to achieve an exponential growth that can be sustained. 
   
   Although sceptics may say that competition can be friendly and create a driving force that spurns people to think more creatively, competition can also have a negative effect when the competitive spirit becomes a destructive forcer that becomes more about individual competition than the original endpoint. In effect competition can sometimes take over and become the focus so that the original goal is lost.  
 
   In terms of global issues and working towards the benefit of society as a whole, definitely much more can be accomplished with a multitude of people working collectively.
