Reality versus Media

Media tries and does manipulate their audiences. It's easy to persuay individuals by packaging alone. The media uses any tactic necessary to get their point across. I believe this has a great emotional impact on individuals. Sometimes it's hard to know the truth.
Most news stations are biased, you can watch to different stations and hear different reportings of the same subject. How do you determine which one is correct. Magazines airbrush individuals so they look perfect, blemish free. Real people are not perfect, but yet strive to emulate what the magizine is representing. It is very unhealthly for the general population that does not live up to the perfection these images display. 

I believe any media that has altered reality should have to legally devulge this information to the general public upfront. For instance, a magazine should have to state that images have been altered to appear more pleasing. News stations should have to legally state that they are being sponsored by a certian corporation, product or political party.

I find these issues have an ill effect on people, it lowers self esteem. Something needs to be done to regulate companies who knowingly give false repesentation. People have the right to know this is a false reality. We should only hear the real accounts when listening to the news. People need to know the truth. Many types media are out for themselves and the big mighty dollar.
