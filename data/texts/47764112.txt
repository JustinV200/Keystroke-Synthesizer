Competition is a process between two or multiple peoples or between organisation they compete each other for success.
In fact, cooperative and competition behaviors can be intimately interwoven.In this behaviour cooperation achieves excellence on it's own, competition doesn't.If your competition is a healthy means that will increases your sucess rate.
Cooperation is a better way to get a sucess if they work together. In that process they can definitely able to share their knowledge, resources and helping tedency etc.,
In competition sometimes they definitely show their agressive nature or else good nature. Competition definitely make everyone into some different nature. Coopertion increases creativity, teamwork, self-esteem and a sense of belonging. some people achieve success without competition, most people need it in order to push themselves to reach there full potential.Competition is not only necessary for reaching them into one good position.
Coopertion improve transparency and accountability, reducing the possibility of correction cooperative is to relaize the economic, cultural and social needs of the organizations memebers and it's surrounding communities it gaining leadership and decision making skills and also gaining selfconfidence.
So the coopertion is better than competition.
