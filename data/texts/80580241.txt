  We all want to win but is that the best soloution to acheve the goals in our lives or is cooperation a better stratagy. I want to think about the different roles these two opposite ideas play in our work life and which one is the better.

   When we think about the best way to  best achive goals and get ahead in life, what is the best way to acomplish these things at work. Should we compete with our colleague at work to get ahead. I think that you should do both because on the one hand you should want to produce your best work and out perform your colleague to increase your level in the company and try to get permotions and the only way to do that it to show you ca complete task and work to your highest level by yourself. But on the other hand you might be considered to harsh and not get premotions if you cant take info and complete task with a team.  And as a group you might accompish better ideas with differant imput form your  co works as a collective . 

   In conclution both might be benifional to your work because you have to compete and show you are good independantly at you job and can complete task better them a co worker. That you are driven , but they will also want to see you can work as a team when it calls for it.
