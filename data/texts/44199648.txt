What does materialism mean to you?  How important is it to your day to day life?  Do you think materialism is a good thing or a bad thing for society?  Today I'm going to give my opionion on this much discussed topic.

Personally I'm not a big fan of materialism.  I've found that as I've gotten older I've wanted less and less stuff in my life.  This doesn't mean that I never purchase anything, it just means that I try to ask myself if I really need something before I buy it.  I've also found myself wanting to throw away older items that I never use anymore.  Basically I want less and less stuff in my life.  So I would certainly desribe myself as being very un-materialistic these days.  I don't need to have the newest or the coolest stuff out there.  There are many reasons to not like materialism.  Saving your money for things that are truly important is a good one.  All of the materialistic things you crave will one day be out of style and no longer of use to you.  

Of course on the flip side of that argument is that people buying thing and wanting the newest stuff is what keeps the economy going.  If people stopped buying new things then the economy would suffer greatly.  Which means we as a society would suffer greatly as well.  When you're younger you want to have nice, cool things.  It's ok, that's a part of life and shouldn't be denied.

So to sum things up, like most things in life materialism is both good and bad.  It greatly depends on the person and perhaps where you are in life and what your values are.  When you're younger you want to be accepted more and have all the nicest and newest thing available.  As you get older you may find yourself not caring about such things anymore.  There is no right or wrong answer to the question of materialism.  And as life goes on chances are that you'll find yourself on both sides of the argument at some point in time.
