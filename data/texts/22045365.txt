In the modern world, illusion has become more important than reality. Social media has elevated the need to create a good impression above all else, and truth has become a casualty.

Keeping up appearances is nothing new. Looking more prosperous, more attractive, happier and more popular than one's peers has been a preoccupation of humanity for as long as contemporary societal structure has existed. However, the creation of advertising may have been a landmark development. Although advertising started with straightforward explanations of product functions and benefits, it evolved into ever-more abstract insinuations of the positive feelings advertisers wanted to associate with their products. Eventually, the true benefits of any given product became irrelevant. One product might be indistinguishable from another in reality, but if it were associated in the consumer's mind with a particular feeling or impression, that consumer could become a lifelong customer.

Sadly, the effectiveness of advertising has been adopted by those consumers and applied to themselves. Today, we are the products and we advertise ourselves daily on social media. Images and impressions are not just important, but all-important. If given the choice between taking a vacation in reality but not being able to document it, or only having pictures to post on social media (causing others to think a vacation had been taken), many would choose the pictures over the real vacation. What other people think we are, or do, has become more important than who we truly are. We may even come to see the illusion as reality, and real life as  something that serves, possibly even interferes with, our online presence. Is it any wonder that so many in Western society are so unhappy?
