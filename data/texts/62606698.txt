I've lost my family. They're lost to misimpressions and misinformation. They do not listen to anything but surface claims these days. Images and impressions they receive from social media seem to have overwhelmed their reason. They do not want facts or more information. They accept it all on the surface only. They used to be considerate people who followed the "love thy neighbor" narrative. Now they are inundated by misdirected hatred toward anyone on the other side of their imaginings. Even me! I've heard it said that the changes in recent years to what is acceptable is a deliberate ploy by those who would seize power and I believe they have been hugely successful.

When I discuss politics with my family now, they quote obscure headlines with no substance or facts and they get defensive if any other, rational, fact-backed view is presented to them. The campaign to mislead them is so successful that they won't even listen to quotes from their own bibles which they once revered. For example, my sibling who owns oil wells believes, because of a headline read on a Facebook group, that wells are more envionmentally sustainable than either solar or wind power because of a more efficient pumping and fracking system being used than some other oil producers employ. With no proof. With no ability to listen to counter arguments. 

It reminds me of documentaries about split families during the civil war. Brothers who could no longer stand each other over their political differences. That is what is happening to many today. The divide is so vast. And it is not based on anything but a great flim flam presence by politicians who want us to watch what one hand is doing and ignore the other one. Social media imaging and the false impressions their brief unsubstantiated claims make on people's reality is becoming the end of our life as we know it. If we don't relearn to embrace truth, to look deeper, then how will we ever unite as a country again?
