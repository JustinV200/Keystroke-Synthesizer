I belive that people are more likely to be happy by focusing on a mix of both their personal goals and the happiness of others, specifically the happiness of close friends and family.  Focusing on only one of the two seems to lead to unfortunate consequences.  You can never be happy if you are only out to please others, nor can you be happy by focusing on only your personal goals.  

How many times do we hear about people in "career" positions that required a college education that they end up getting burnt out in?  Or the persual of an unused college degree that cost thousands of dollars?  Often times people in these types of situations wonder why they wanted to achieve said goal, questioning whether it was even their own idea or societies idea of a good personal goal that was worth their persuing.  Not to mention the fact that many peoples personal goals are finance or material related, and we all know that money does not buy happiness.

And while the idea of focusing on the happiness of others sounds like a good way to achieve happiness, I think it can be easily overdone.  Everybody needs time to focus on themselves and what they need.  Not that making other people happy isn't a good thing, of course. 

At the end of the day, nobody is happy all the time, everyone has their good and bad days.  However to best your odds I believe a balanced life is the way to go.  Find a job you enjoy doing, make time for yourself as well as others, and set goals related to both your career and personal interests.
