What is materialism? Materialism is in fact what every human participates in some way or another.  Some people see it as owning items, while other see they own too much and want to purge as much as they can so they can be more minimal. Then they're the people that are in between. 

Nobody has a right for being criticized for being materialistic unless is counts toward hoarding. But as a normal average person with an average amount of materials I think its completely fine. There is a fine line between hoarding and collecting. But as long as looks presentable I think its fine and society could care less.

We as humans we do tend to donate or trash items as things don't work for us anymore or just are destined for the trash. As what I assume most society does do both of those things so that also helps our materials not go out of check. I mean there are maybe a few people that go nuts for collecting a fair amount of items but as long as its in control nobody really cares.

So its safe to say that as long as are an average person that in life gets rid of materials then I would say society has more to worry about then materials. Honestly nobody really cares about things you own. People have better things to worry about then caring about materials and how much you own.  Things like bills and making money are way more important then how many things you own.
