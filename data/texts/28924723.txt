Materialism leads the life in different form so many assets helps people look rich but necessary things and assets make us look smart which includes materialism. Assets makes the person valuable, spending on different assets is not a smart move, spend wise in the material that we use regularly. 
Modern people only have the mind to have all the expensive products but not have valuable assets. "Old is Gold" so value the old ones which makes us look more unique than other.Live the life of our own, dont rush to attain every thing in your life. Placing yourself in higher standard is not based on the material you have in your life so start attaining the better life standard with the assets which makes you place there. 
Future is going to be little tuff for some of us or may be many of us but leaving the foot prints to the youngsters with good material value makes us becoming a role model to others. 
Life is very short so enjoy the present moment, stop rushing towards the future by running and leaving the good memories behind. Buying stuff is good but what we buy matters always. Be materialistic in your price and better placement.
