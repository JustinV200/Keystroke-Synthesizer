 yes images and impression have too much effect on people for everyday life .we see our daily product or neccessary things around the market .but present day we also find the neccessary things in online market place .life is so faster than the previous world.but before buying a new product we always prefer their advertisement and we also  follow the reviews of the product .after that we buy that product .

in the present situation all the things around us we find out by their online images .but reality is another things .all around us happens are mistaken for reality .some of the online market site are not honest .most of the time they do some mistake for earning too much money .for that reason they do everything and they collect hd picture  and upload the picture on the online site .but people are come to the site by viewing the images .and an attractive picture pleasant people a lot .but this is not good for the customers.on the offline shopping people can easily found their desirable things .and also can take this product by good quality .there are lot of chance to purchase the best quntity product on the offline shop. on the online platform the chance is zero.sometimes people come to the site by attracting from the advertisement but most of the time the advertisement is not good .thus we estimate that images and impression have too much effect on people.
but above the negativity all time all advertisement is not clever .most of the time we find good things in the reality .we see everything but it doesnot means that everything is good or bad 
.most of the public figure we can see in the online site they are too much happy and we also trust them by showing the external images on the online.but reality is not too much good.we see the people are not same in the real life.real is always good .but its true all time online advertisement is not bad .sometimes it carry good impression for the people.for that reason images and impression have too much effect on people.sometimes we justify the people by their images and we areappreciate their good work by advertisement.so we should avoid this clever advertisement which are dangerous for us .and media also should be advertised the good things.not too much things which are beyond the capability of public figures politicians and other online products .if we reduce this problem we will find the reality on the social media advertisement.
