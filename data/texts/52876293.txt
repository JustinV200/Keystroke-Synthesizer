In a world where it's more important to look like you know what you're saying, rather than actually being knowledgeable on the topic you're discussing, yes, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. You can tell someone anything, whether it's through a presentation, or just through talking, if you make it look good, people are much more likely to believe you. Actors and actresses get roles because they look good, not because they can act, people get arrested because they "look" like a criminal, even if there's no evidence supporting it, people get bashed just for looking unattractive. Images have way too much power over people, and frankly, that'll never change.

Politicians, a lot of them barley know what they're saying, but if they look good while doing it, and speak with confidence, people will eat up every word. Just look at Donald Trump and how he got his way into presidency. He spoke with confidence, he kbew how to grab people's attention, it helped that he was an entertainer, cause that's exactly what he was, entertaining. People would vote for Donald Trump because of how well he could speak and sway people. Another example of images having too uch power is that unattractive people are treated badly and are more likely to be seen as creeps or weirdos, even if what they're doing isn't creepy in the slighest. And attractive people can get away with a lot of creepy stuff before they get called out on it.

In conclusion, images and impressions have too much power over people because it makes it more important to look like you're competent than to actually be competent, and people are more likely to judge you harshly if you don't look good.
