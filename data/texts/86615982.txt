People are more happy when they focus on their personal goals. They are so because when people focus on their personal goals, they are often more indpendent and have more freedom when it comes to what they want to choose to do in their lives. Independence is what can lead to happiness and like I've mentioned, independence is what people can receive when they focus on their own goals, rather than on the happiness of others. Some people, like myself, would rather focus on improving oneself, than making other people happy, or caring if people are happy or not. 

For example, like I said, I, myself, am more happy when I focus on myself and on my personal goals than on the happiness of others. Admittedly, I am more happy this way because I am selfish and care most about myself. I never donate money, no matter what the cause or charity is, and keep all of the money for myself so I can pay my bills and keep myself fed and entertained. I barely make enough money to make ends meet for myself, but even if I did make more, I would honestly rather buy a mansion in California than donate money to a charity or a cause. Why? Because having and living in an expensive mansion with a nice car is what would make me most happy. I would want to live my life to the fullest. 

In conculsion, I believe that people are more happy when they focus on their personal goals than when they care about the happiness of those around them. I believe this because people are more happy when they can act independently and choose what they want to do in their lives. Even though some people might be able to achieve happiness by helping other people and by trying to improve the world itself, this is not true for everyone, especially people who are more selfish and independent, like I am. Even if people try to find something other than their own happiness, it might or might not happen. There is no guarantee that this will happen.
