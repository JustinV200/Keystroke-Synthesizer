There are a lot of reasons why modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic. However, materialism is not just a human fault but universal among higher organisms. 

From the smallest insect to human beings themselves, we could not survive without the instinct to gather things to ourselves and keep them safe for our own use. The hermit crab that scuttles along the beach searching for a new shell to inhabit is practicing materialism. The bees that defend their hives from intruders while gathering honey is practicing materialism. It is instinctual and can not be overcome.  

Does that mean that materialism can not lead to excess consumption or even evil intentions? Of course not. When neighbors fight over a fenceline or countries go to war to defend their resources, there is almost always an alternative way to settle their differences and still keep what is rightfully theirs. Given our fallen nature however, we are prone to forcefully defend what is our to the point of even bloodshed. It is our superior logic and reasoning that enables us to overcome our avorious desires and still enjoy the fruits of our labors.

Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic? Should the hermit crab or the honey bee? Of course not. What should be criticized, and rightfully so, is our propensity to excess. But that is true of all our traits, not just materialism.
