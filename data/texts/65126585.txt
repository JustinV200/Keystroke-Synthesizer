I do not think modern society should be criticized for being to materialistic.  i believe that its only human nature.  if my neighber puts up brand new bushes outside and i think it looks nice, of course i will also want to put similar or even better brand new bushes outside.  

I think as a society we gauge ourselves based on what we have versus what everyone else has.  There is an old popular saying "he who dies with the most toys, wins"  I think that a lot of people take that to heart.  Most people will hold the people with the biggest house or fanciest car, in the highest regard and always compare themselves to the possessions of others.  if we have less than them, we aspire to have what they have.  if we have more than them, well, then we must be doing better than them.  

of course its not always the case.  we never know what goes on behind the curtain.  those with the biggest house or fanciest car, could very well be buried in debt.  those living by modest means could have an abundance of money in the bank or could be planning for the future of their family or for college or both.  those with modest accomodations could be minimalist and not want to care for or clean or have to take care of all of these fancy things.  

in closing i dont think society should be criticized for being materialistic but even more so i do not think that it should be everyones measuring stick for how they are doing in their day or their life.  theres always things that one doesnt know and sometimes the smaller picture is way more obvious than the bigger picture.
