Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?

I believe both cooperation and competition promote success.  When we cooperate it gives us a chance to learn and to strive, to watch others and to grow. Cooperation is a key to success.  And competition gives us something to strive for, a goal, that we would otherwise not have. It builds our strengths and diminishes our weaknesses, gives us something to follow, something to lead, we feel like a winner even we don't come in first because we have tried and therefore that is success is it not?

If I had to pick I would say Cooperation would lead to more success than cooperation.  Think if we were not to cooperate! If we said no to everything, no to trying, no to learning, no to growing, how would we succeed if that were the case? When we cooperate we are saying, yes, I am here to learn, here to grow, here to succeed!  Show me the way!

So in closing, I believe you can achieve much more success by cooperation!  The opposite is giving up, not trying, losing, failing, and in short, not succeeding. Cooperation is important in our everyday lives!  Everyone deserves a chance, a goal to strive for, new things to learn, and a prize to win in the end!  If we cooperate we will get there!
