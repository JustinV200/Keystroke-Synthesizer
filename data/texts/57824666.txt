What is the definition of happiness? Where does it come from? How do people achieve happiness? Are they happier if they do things to makes themselves happy or should they make others happy instead?  I would like to explore all these questions in depth. 

I think the definition of happiness is: whatever a person can do to make their heart smile. It can be from a new car purchase, watching a baby laugh for the first time, or something as simple as watching a flower grow from the seed that they planted. I think the scale of happiness varies from one person to the next, bases on their life experiences. I believe that some people are more  materialistic than others but it does not mean that it makes either one of these groups less happy. 

Is it ok someone makes themselves happy? I don't see any reason why this would be wrong. If they are happy I believe they are happy around those around them and their happiness will spread like beatiful wildflowers. This is something positive and attractive for most people. I have encountered people that have a disdain for people that are happy because they are very miserable in their own life. Happy people cannot help these sad people, no matter how hard they try. This is very sad. 

Should someone disregard their own happiness and just focus on making other people happy instead? Absolutely not! I think this would be detrimental to the person doing this and could only bring resentment and negativity later on in life, even if this person is successful. Some people do this their whole life and then suddenly wake up in their fifties and wonder why they wasted so much time on making other people happy when they do no have those people in their life anymore. This is also very sad.

In closing, I would like to say these things: Be yourself, be happy, be kind. If a person does these three things they will have a happy life and make those around them happy. I promise!
