   Have you ever noticed how nothing seems to be real anymore. No one wants to give anyone the honest truth. They just show poeple what they want to see.In today's world, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. People will believe anything nowadays and because of that, companies can get away with a lot, people will believe anything that a celebrity says, and the public will take a politician's word because they align with their values.
   First of all, companies can get away with anything they want. Disney, for example, can get away with so much. Disney is currently in court with an author of a property that they using over book royalties. Disney is hoping that they die before they have to pay anything. Continuing on, people will believe anything that celebrities say. For example Tess Holiday, the plus size model, tells people that she's healthy even though she's obese and they just believe her. Another example is Dove Cameron. She tells her fans that she hasn't had plastic surgery when it's so obvious that she has. Her diehard fans just believe her when it's right there in your face. Finally, the public will take a politician's word if they have the same values as them. People that don't want abortion will vote for someone that has that same belief and just excuse all of their horrid behavior because of that. However, I can understand why people gravitate towards these types of images and impressions. They want to see their ideal. People want an excape from reality and that's what this gives them.
   In conclusion, media has far too much of an effect on people. It gives people a false idea of what to expect and gets their hopes up too high. Although they can provide a nice excape from reality, the effects are still pretty damaging.
