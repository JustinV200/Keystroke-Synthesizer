    I feel that people need to be able to cooperate and compete in a healthy manner to achieve success. Everyone one is differnt and we all have different motives for completing tasks quicker and more effiently. Many people work well being able to bouce off ideas from one another, and just as many can achieve success by having a little competition.
   Competing in life at times won't get you very far, sometimes you win, sometimes you loose. After all the finish line is ultimately the same for everyone. Other times you might just need that little extra push from another to help you achieve the success you are looking for/trying to achieve.
   Cooperation is needed to achieve success because you will need to be able to cooperate with team mates, and bosses. You will need to make sure you and  everyone has a full understanding of the rules and guidelines to acheieve the success you are looking for. You also must be able take on constructive critisim. By cooperating with one another you will have a better outlook on the success of a project.
   Cooperating with a group of team mates and competeting against another group of cooperating team mates could be the answer in creating success for those seeking full achievement. I feel groups cooperating together to compete would work best for me and my peers. I cannot say that for everyone, and a little competition is always fun.
