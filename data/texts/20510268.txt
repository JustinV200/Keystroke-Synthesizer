In my opinion, I believe that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Materials in life will come and go but will never stay forever. You can not take anything with you when you die so it is pointless to obsess over materials.

Even though most of our energy is spend on purchasing and consuming materials, we should not let it own us as people. We need to be able to rise over the greed that lives in our hearts and try to share with others more often. In our world we are very posessive and that is the reason why someone can have everything and their next door neighbor can be struggling to pay rent.

God has given us a purpose in life and that is to love one another. You can not do that when you are busy worrying about what you want to purchase next or who has the latest designer clothes. It will never make you happy to own everything that you want. It can not help your soul and spirit but will only tarnish it and make it sour. Money is just a piece of paper and only has value because we make it have value.

A persons belongings will wither like grass on a hot day when we die, so we need to try and not let our belongings dictate how we live our lives.
