Happiness is believed to be achieved by focusing on making yourself happy first or by focusing on the happiness of others. Basically, you can make yourself happy or depend on the happiness of others to determine your happiness.

It is my personal opinion that happiness can only be achieved when you yourself are happy first. Personal happiness may include achieving small personal goals over a short period of time or working toward those goals over a long period of time. Someone can be happy by completing a simple daily "to-do" list or possibly by simply checking some items off of that list.  The level of happiness can only be measured by the person completing the process, therefore you measure your own happiness.

It is also perceived that happiness can be achieved through making others happy.  Seeing others happy, makes you happy.  As each individual determines whether or not they are happy, I would think that this approach to happiness would be like chasing a leaf in the wind or short-lived at best. Because you are depending on others level of happiness for you to be happy, there is no guarantee that you would be happy the majority of the time.  Each individual person determines what happiness is to them, which may be very different than what happiness is to you.

When you depend on yourself for something it is only you that is responsible for that outcome.  I would much rather depend on myself and make myself happy first rather than relying on others to fulfill my happiness with their happiness.  There is no guarantee that no matter what you do it will lead to the happiness of another.
