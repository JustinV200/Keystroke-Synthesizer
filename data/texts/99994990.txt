                Materialism is one aspect that people in life want to acquire as it many want the feeling of acquiring possesions and spending money. But some over-emphasize the importance of it and put it in front of family, disobeying moral standards. Due to this situation, modern society should definitely be criticized for being materialistic as it is ruining lives and making others greedy/jealous. Many spend their life's savings to get materials that mean little to nothing.

                  Next, take rich young sports players who grew their wealth exponentially in a years time or less. This makes them greedy, and buy materialistic things to either show off or to attract attention. In addition, this leads to them being homeless and losing the majority of their wealth in just a few months. Many of them overspend and not think properly on how to set their life, to use this money to make more. However, some may say that modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic as it brings happiness and pleasure. This is flawed because the happiness that comes from it is temporary and will go away eventually, leading them to buy more, engraving their downhill path, ultimately, making them sad/depressed. Therefore, society should be criticized for being materialistic.

                  In conclusion, many have made mistakes in their lives, which have led to ultimate circumstances that are holding them down. If society were not this greedy for materials, many would have seen better dawns in their life. Furthermore, many are also not educated on how to invest these earnings. All in all, modern society has made plenty of mistakes and them being too materialistics/ being criticized for it is not new.
