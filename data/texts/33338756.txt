While talking with others we may tell outer appearance of a person may be defective, but what matters is the inner soul. But the hard truth of what we see the most is the outer appearance of the thing whether it may be a product or analysing a human. We never see how the heart of the person is, instead we see does the person look smart, attractive,etc..

Here I would like to share a small story of a doctor. The doctor was teased for his outer appearance and his clothing manners at the airport. The doctor just smiled and moved on. On his way to out of the airport there a human was suffering from a sudden cardiac arrest. When the doctor cured the person the same people who teased him realised their mistake and applauded at him.

While voting for elections also there wer two candidates one has a good heart but looks ugly and the other has a attractive appearance but a evil heart. People voted for the person with the attractive appearance in the elections and after he came as a politician they realised their mistake and felt bad so although the images and impressions are required the quality is more important. If good product quality comes with impressive outer packaging and good hearted human comes with a grand and attractive appearance then it will be the best. So, it is better that they makes their images and impressions attractive so they create a good impact on people.
