Where do you find the most happiness?  Is it by achieving your own personal goal and/or dreams or by seeing happiness in others?  This essay will explore both possibilities and arrive at a clear conclusion.

I believe that happiness is derived by viewing happiness in others.  I cannot dispute, however, that you can become extremely happy when you accomplish your own personal goal(s).  When I had saved enough money to buy my own first house on my own I was thrilled!  I had accomplished a seemingly impossible task and was over joyed.  I was even more thrilled, however, when my grandson opened a lego gift he did not think he was going to receive at Christmas and he could not contain himself as a result.  Also, watching my neighbor's son belly laugh at a magic show I took him to made me laugh with glee!  This type of joy is incomparable.

Many people, however, feel that their joy is unmatched when they graduate from college, buy their first home, get promoted at work, or have their first child.  I ask you though, which is more joyous -- giving birth to a child or watching that child laugh his/her first laugh?  Aren't we extraordinarily happy when we watch that toothless grin for the first time?  A simple giggle of happiness from a baby can provide us much more satisfaction than graduating from college ever could.  Watching the joy of happy innocent children at play cannot help but make your entire day brighter and better.  It is beloved.  

So now I ask each of you reading this....are you happier when your savings account reaches the amount you were seeking or on Christmas day when you watch your friends and family open the gifts you gave them?  There is no joy like watching the happiness of others.  It provides me with amazing giggles and warms my heart!  Happiness is better than medicine and I would never be happy again without seeing joy in others.
