Materialism. We have all heard this word, but few have been able to take a strong stance on whether it is a positive thing or a negative thing. According to the dictionary, materialism is defined as "the tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values". Many individuals find that more things equals more meaning and happiness in one's life. Is materialism a good thing? Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?

People are often told "money doesn't buy happiness". Yet, in modern society, individuals are inundated with images of wealth on television, movies, in magazines, billboard road signs, etc. We live in an era of "fast fashion", where many clothing pieces are only ever worn once, then are deemed "out of fashion" by many influencers. We spend a lot of energy producing and consuming items that in many instances, are only ever used less than a handful of times. 

While modern society is materialistic, and many would agree, I do not think society by itself is to blame for being too materialistic. Fashion companies, fashion influencers, corporations, all also play a part in this materialistic era. If sustainabilty was trendy and fashionable, then I do not think materialism would be as big of an issue as it is.
