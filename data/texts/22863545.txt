Society views outer appearances as more important than what is within. People get judge based on appearances first. The packaging is usually the first thing that captures people's attention when consumers shop. Instead of looking at outer appearances, we should get to know someone and learn more about a product before passing judgement.

Why is it important to not judge people or products based on appearances first? Of course it is human nature to be attracted to something that is pretty and beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. A person that looks attractive outside may not be a good person inside. He or she may not be a nice person, a smart person, a friendly person, etc. A product's packaging may look attractive but the product may be low quality, not function that well, etc. So people should try not to judge anyone or anything just by appearances alone. 

We live in a society where appearances matter a lot. Appearances are the first thing that people look at and be judged on. It creates a society that is shallow without depth. It can create problems such as low self esteem, eating disorders and expectations that are unattainable. People should learn that there are much more to a person or a product besides appearances and always get to know them more. Next time you caught yourself judging someone or something based on appearances, remind yourself that what you see isn't necessarily what you get.
