We all live in materialstic society where most people now a days has been concerned with modern society for being more materialstic.Now a days there is much emphasis on what clothes you are wearing , which car do you own, and how you have been living.Therefore Materialism should be criticized :

Firstly, People beleive that to have a actual happiness by owning and buying things are necessary to have a happiness in life but as a result of this the high materialistic people are not giving importance to enivironment and the society.

But it is beleived that being materialstic is a part human behaviour as this is developed in humans due to the situations that make them insecure such as difficult in family relationships and fear of death.

we can conclude this by saying Materialism not only misleads people to go in a wrong way to seek happiness, on the other hand they are unaware about the other things which will make them truly happiness and to see wonderful things in life because there are people who spends their life by spending money they don't have because these type of people may be influnced by seeing other people who spends more money and live life luxioriously.This type of thinking is not good as they are influenced by other people lifestyles.
