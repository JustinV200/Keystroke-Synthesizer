Some people believe that, they are actually happy when they focus on others happiness. Some might think happiness depends upon their own. While taking a survey we can come to conclude which one is better, so that we can change our mind set according to that.

First of all when we depend on other's happiness we can not individually be happy. We should always depend on others for each and every situations.  This happiness is not stable, it gives happiness to short period of time only. While focusing goals on others thier wish only will be fullfilled. It just only guide us to go in the route.

We should only focus the goals on our personal rather than other's personal. So that we can be very happy  on achieving our goals. On day to day life people focus on others rather than their lifes. In this modern society people get used by seeing others personal goals and getting used in their daily lifes. But actually this is not at all real happiness. Only if they concentrate in thier own goals in their personal life it would be real happiness rather than others. So it is very advisable that people sould focus on their personal goals.
