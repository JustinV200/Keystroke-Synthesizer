Our society has developed beyond what our ancestor could imaging but would they be rolling over in their grave today if they took a look at all the marterialistic that is happening ? In our socieity it is a way of life to buy goods. Most of us buy something every day wether it is a candy bar at lunch or it is a weekly trip to walmart but there is always a sense of must have more. Some might say it what it is that is just how we are but take a moment and think about is this stuff just to much is it taking away from our happiness? Should we be criticed for all our materialism and stop and try do to better.  The answer is yes. 
 In society today marterialism has gotten out of control we even have a tv shows documenting the sadness and pain materalism has caused. Ever heard of a little show call Hoarders buried alive. Yes buried alive . That is what is happening to our society we are getting buried alive with all the stuff we have to have and we just buy buy and for what. We can't take it with us when we pass away. It is just sad  how the need to have stuff has just taking over our lives. 
If we start to really look at how our lives would be like if we would take a step back from the buying and just enjoy life we might live a happier life. Taking a real look at what the need to buy does to a person will make you start to think about what is truly important in life. Focusing on friends and family and not stuff will make a person happier. 
Buying goods and service is part of our modern soceity but our modern society doens't have to be consumed with it . When we step out of our materialism we will find true happiness. Take the step today you will not be disappointed.
