Happiness is something we all wish to achieve.  This is a feeling that can be achieved through many different avenues.  In general, we can think of happiness coming from working toward a personal goal or working toward goals of others and finding happiness along the way.  For me, I think happiness is best achieved by working toward a personal goal.  The trick is setting a goal that is truly worth achieving.  If you are a kind hearted person, this goal will likely benefit others which will work as a combination of both ideologies.

I take this position because of first hand experience.  In my life, I have found that I am most happy when I work toward a personal goal that helps and benefits others.  Whether this is a team sport, group project, or a stand alone objective; I find it is most rewarding to achieve something that gives me satisfaction as well as others.

It is easy to make an argument that people are most happy when being altruistic.  Although that is true to an extent, I think it is equally important to be pleased with ones self.  When a person is happy with their own self, their actions will naturally reflect this feeling and benefit those around them.  

In summary, gratification is best achieved through being happy with yourself and providing happiness to others around you.
