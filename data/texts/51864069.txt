When looking at what type of people acheive success two traits come to mind. You are either a cooperative person who is go with the flow and would be great for any team. Or you are a competetive person who is willing to go to any level to get a task done. 
If you look at these two qualitys side by side you will see that havings a competetive edge will give you more power to make you successful in life.

If you look at profession athletes you can see that their competitive edge not only makes them amazing at sports but also helps in other aspects of life. One example is Richard Sherman who is a professional NFL player. Sherman on the field has used his ambition to be successful in many ways, he has had the most interception recoveries in a season, made it to the Pro Bowl multiple years and he has won a Superbowl. He has also taken this drive off the field and completed his Masters while staying a fith year in college before being drafted to the NFL.

Although he also has traits of cooperation, which also has helped in his success. I beleive that Shermans competetive edge is what made him what he is today. He is not the only athlete that has a story like this, there are many others who pursure businesses, finish Masters, Drs. Ect.
