In the workforce it is common to see a variety of ways employers push their workers to achieve success. Two of these ways are cooperation and competition. Competition is when one employee's work, actions, and motives are pitted against their peers. On the other hand cooperation is when employees will come together to work on an assignment to the benifit of everyone, including the company. While both techniques are good to use in the workforce, cooperation leads to more success in the long-term. 

Cooperation allows employees to pull together resources that they are individually interested in and are comfortable with and share them with their peers. Their peers are also able to do the same, being able to account for many areas where one employee may lack a specific skill or understanding in. A team will work better when each individual is confident in what they can contribute, and in turn strengthen the other members to achieve a higher success than trying to compete with lackluster knowledge. Cooperation is also an excellent way to build confidence in social interation skills that will help members of the group in working throughout their lives. 

In conclusion, cooperation is the better option for achieving higher success than competition. Cooperation involves people skills, resouce management, and communication, which allows for workers to build their confidence in these areas moving forward in their lives. While it may seem to be holding someone back in the moment, each person is able to learn something and carry that with them to their next job, and allowing them to succeed.
