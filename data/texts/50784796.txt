In our society the appearance or image of a person or thing is often more prominent than the reality of that person or thing.  This is often seen in advertising, politics, and entertainment. In advertising  a product is presented as being exciting or effective or economical.  As consumers we tend to accept the advertising claims which don't really go to the effectiveness of the product.  But it is important to know what is true to get the product most beneficial to us.

In politics we hear a lot of words from politicians, but they say very little, just generalities about what the politician thinks we want to hear. Rather than what they may be, the candidate projects a certain image.  Of course, this is done to get the candidate elected or to stay in power, but for the benefit of society, we need to know concrete information about the politcal players, so as to best judge them and hold them accountable.

In entertainment, of course people are always portrayed in a positive light.  So Will Smith may be seen as Mr. Nice Guy until he slaps someone.  Or Bill Cosby is America's Dad until it is learned that he drugged women. Or a comedian is seen as a happy guy until he commits suicide.  In the case of entertainers, I don't think it hurts society so much--these people still entertain us, but it does show how image is different from reality.  And in politics and consumerism it is important to tell the difference between appearance and reality.
