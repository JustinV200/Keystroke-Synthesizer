I do think that modern society should be ctiticized for being materialistic. There is a huge disparaity between people that have a lot of money, and people that do not. The ones that do not are worried about buying food, clothes, housing, and other basic necessities. While the people that have a lot of money don't care about those basic necessities as they are something that they are not worried about. They have so much money, that they can focus on materialistic things. The rich person can buy a $10 million yacht. While the poor person can barely afford their $800 a month rent. If society as a whole was less focused on being materialistic, then the wealth could be spread out among the population. Everyone would be able to live comfortable and not worry about being able to afford basic necessities. Nobody can say with a straight face that a person needs to have over $100,000,000 to be able to live. Yet we have billionaires who are able to buy whatever they want. They feel as though they need so much money, because society is presented in such a way that materialism equals success. However, if society was changed to where helping your fellow human meant success, then everyone would be able to live a fruitful and fullfilling life.
