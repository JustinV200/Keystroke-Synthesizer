Materialism in it's many forms has contributed so much to where we are as a human race.  Materialism has been the basis for scientific progress, wars that were fought, and many of the new marvels that we take for granted today.  The desire for new and better things has certainly brought us further from our caveman days.  But is it all good?  Have we as a human race gone to far with our love of things?

Throughout our lives, there will always be questions.  Questions which demand a black and white answer.  The problem is that there is rarely an answer to a question that is ojectively black or white.  The concept of the negativity or positivity of materialism is no different.  In many ways, we've become consumed with our obsession with what we have, specifically compared with what other people have.  Because of this, I tend to believe that it is not necessarily our obsession with materials is what's inherintly bad, it's our obsession with having more materials than our neighbors.  

The desire for things and materialism has in many ways contributed to a better society and planet.  It's created better lives for much of the globe.  Materialism is a massive contributer to a thriving economy.  With that being said, basically all good things need to be reined in from time to time.  This might be one of those times.  Our materialism has been determined to be harming the planet.  Materialism is potentially harming lives through social media and getting people into debt.  There are definitely some people that need to take a long hard look at their lives, and determine for themselves whether materialism has gone from a pleasure, to an obsession.
