Similar to keeping yourself hydrated throughout the day, happiness is considered to be quite important by many - no matter their race or gender. As a 23-year-old, it is apparent that I am nowhere near the age to advise others on topics such as these. However, I have made a few attempts to make up for it, which included reading up on the stances of philosophers throughout the ages. And based on this, I personally believe that it is easier to obtain happiness by focusing on a few main goals that are based on their own hobbies and interests as well as ambitions. 
Many people come across this exact issue as they search for a life purpose. From what I have heard as well as read, a good portion of people often tend to fixate on what they believe that they need to do to obtain happiness, which ends up making them feel miserable instead due to their obsession. Furthermore, life always has its ups and downs. Even if one does happen to "obtain" happiness, they should not assume that they will always have it. Without proper tools and attention, it is impossible to keep a physical item in good shape - so how can one assume that they can continue to keep an intangible thing?
Although there are indeed a certain group of people that feel happy as long as others are happy, in the end, it is again, a personal goal for them to help others. From this point of view, the best option is for people to first thoroughly learn about themselves, and set a few personal goals that has no deadlines. After that, they could set smaller goals and objectives to reach the personal goals they have set.
