Is competition the only what to achieve success? Or could it be that the success enjoyed by cooperation is an equal or perhaps even better way to achieve a more lasting success? 

Although phenomenal success and even record setting performances are a natural outcome of competition, these successes are targeted, and contribute to the common good in the short term by inspiring others to exceed those performances, which will inevitablly happen in the course of time. By contrast, cooperation provides a more general and longer lasting success based on the bonds created and common success of all of those involved. In fact, it can be argued that even in a competition, a successful result is not the competition alone, but the teamwork involved in that competing.

Take for instance the example of a professional sports team. Each game is a competition, and in fact, each player competes to even be a part of the team. But winning each game is only achieved when the team cooperates to win the competition.

Some might say that this logic can be deconstructed to a set of competitions, which is perhaps true. But in order to construct a higher level of achievment, those individual competitons must be joined through cooperation. The result is not only success, but the benefit of relationships and synergy acheived through teamwork and common success.

The question is not then competition vs. cooperation, but how the two complement each other - to achieve success that goes beyond the short term and becomes a lasting structure.
