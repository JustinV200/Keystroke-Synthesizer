I believe first impressions in many instances make all the difference. With products on store shelves, packaging that is engaging and eye catching will sell more than maybe lower cost, or even healthier options where packaging is less colorful and does not stand out as well. I think this is because when we are young children we are introduced to cartoons and movies, toys, etc that are bright, colorful, fun. So in some way even as an adult our eyes tend to gravitiate towards those things when we see them in everyday life. 

When it comes to celebrities, and well known public figures, it is sad that appearance makes such a difference in how we preceive people. It is quite unfortunate because looks don't equal high intelligence, great talent, or even a good presonality. I feel like we should be judged on our performance, actions, accomplishments much more than looks, and wardrobe.  

There is definitely too much weight put into images and impressions over abilities and talent. This can often lead to "cancel culture", bullying, and loss of work and collaboration opportunities for public figures and influencers. Far too many public figures, celebrities, and influencers have put out a false persona online for the public to see and it creates a false idea of this perfect life. Often that life is very much a lie or is hiding real life struggles. This false curtain online can make people who look up to them feel inadequate and as though they are not doing something right if they dont have a similar lifestyle, home, etc. With how important mental health is right now, this is something I honestly wish more public figures especially took into account when posting things on social media specifically.
