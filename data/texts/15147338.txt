          Anyone who has ever held or has a leadership position in a company will have at one point wondered how he or she could increase their team's productivity. As with anything related to the emotions and thoughts of humans, this is not a simple issue. How does one foster an environment in which their constituents will perform their best? On one end of the spectrum is competition- encouraging ruthlessness by showing favor to those who are independent and capable of performing without the help of others; on the other, cooperation- a setting in which people are encouraged to be selfless and step in when their peers are in need of assistance. I believe that in order to efficiently achieve success, there needs to be a healthy balance between the two- leaning slightly more in the favor of the spirit of cooperation.
         Many companies who wish to pursue more efficient success, and can afford to, will turn to consultants to analyze their employees' behavior and performance. As with most concepts with humans, context is important- factors such as the type of industry they work in, emotional/mental needs of employees, location, etc. all lead to different results and opinions. However, I believe only by working together towards a common goal will success be achieved. Humans are social creatures. Since birth, we rely on others (our parents or guardians) for our survival. As we grow older, some fall for the misconception that they can do everything alone. Life was not meant to be lived that way. However, a healthy balance of competition can encourage constituents to be their best. They can look at their better-performing peers as inspiration to do and be better.
         Cooperation, with a little touch of competition, is the best option to produce significant, lasting success. We should encourage people to work together because we are social creatures but also encourage some competition so that the inspiration to be better is there.
