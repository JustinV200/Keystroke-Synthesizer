Hi all, 

I am here to give you some thoughts about people acheive more succes by cooperation or by competition.

Cooperation and competition are not contarary energies. Contest is vital for collaboration to try and exist.  You have been prepared to imagine that opposition and participation are contrary energies, yet a couple of moments of thought show that this is not correct.

Rivalvary exisits at whatever point of chioices are looked at.  Rivalry is, in the most straight forward and broadest terms, a coorelation should be made amoung choices. Those options are in contest with each other.  at the point when you go with an decision, one of these other options WIN the opposition among these other options.

Before participation happens, you should choose who to collaboration with and how to help out them. You can not helps out everybody  every way under the sun. So you pick by contrastig among contending choices. until you persue that decision, no collaboratons is conceivable.

The genuine inverse of rivalry is no other options, a solitary decision with no contest. At the point when there is no decision, there is no contet, however there is additionally no participation, Assuming you .ust choose between limited options, there is just impulse, bondage.  the expression participation suggest you have a decision.
