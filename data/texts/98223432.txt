Although important in informing our ability to interpret the world around us, images and impressions often have too much of an effect on people. In general, most people are highly visual processors. We observe the world around us and use those observations to form opinions. However, relying too much on images and impressions without taking the time to develop discernment and investigate the content of those images can be very dangerous. 

Our ability to form opinions on images and impressions is a key factor in being able to process the world around us. In situations of danger, being able to interpret the signs of that danger quickly before acting is key to safety and sometimes even survival. However, only allowing images to inform our opinions can also be dangerous and cause us to be very misguided. 

This is particularly true in today's social media culture. Social media is built on the sharing of images and nicely packaged marketing material. Celebrities are now made by the simple sharing of a video or an image. Within this media, however, is a powerful source of misinformation. Subpar products are easily highly rated with a few snaps of a camera and a celebrity endorsement. Politicians can quickly incite fear and hatred with short video segments taken out of context. 

In order to be able to succeed as a society, humans need to be able to pause and look beyond the shiny packaging of the images being presented. As a community we need to take the time to investigate the truth behind products, appearances, and political promises. We need to be develop discernment and not allow misguided first impressions to color our views of the world.
