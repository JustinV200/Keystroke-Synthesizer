I think cooperation is more of the key to success versus competition. Although there are certain people who seem to thrive off of competition, many others would rather avoid it altogether. I personally like cooperating with others and feel more motivated to reach a goal when I am on the same page as everyone else. It brings a real sense of unity to a group that is trying to achieve the same goal instead of thinking of ways to upstage or put down someone else's ideas like you would in a competitive settin.
Competition also put me on edge and makes me quite paranoid. I feel like I cannot trust anyone and someone is always out to get me. It does not motivate me to work harder to achieve success, rather it makes me feel less sure of my abilities. Competition can bring out the worst aspects of one's personality, especially if they feel they have to make themselves look better than another person. We do not have to cut down others to make ourselves more succefful. I believe that leads to hurt feelings for the person who did not reach the goals as well as feelings of inadequacy.
Many children are taught that competition is good and you are only accepted if you are the best. This does not teach teamwork in my opinion. We should learn to accept our flaws and try our hardest to improve on them, but if we are not the best at something it is alright. You can achieve success by cooperating with others by sharing ideas and feeling happy for someone when they do well. If there was more emphasis put on cooperation than there would less need for competition.
