   Cooperation and competition are not opposites. Competition and cooperation is just the behavioural strategy people choose to success. They don't make real difference in the coincidental final result that lead to; it is the puropse they are carried out for that makes difference.
  You need to be competitive in order to be sharp and efficient at all time. Being competitive brings out the success.
  Being cooperation increases your learning potential as you are working with others and learning from them and their point of view to be success.
  I think the world is getting more competitve day by day due to more talent. So to successed you have to beat the talent and only way to do is "HARD WORK".
  There is no substitute to hard work.
  There is no shortcut for sucess. 
  You have to work hard as well as smart.
  You have to make a distinction on when it's beneficial for you to be either competitive or cooperative and that usually comes down to good judgement. 
  At the end, the way i see it is that being competitive with yourself usually is the most effective way to success. In addition to that, in dealing with other people it is best to be both cooperatitive  and competitive.
