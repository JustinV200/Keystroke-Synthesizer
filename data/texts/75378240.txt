      I like to think that "happiness" is acheived while being actively present and cognitively in touch with their own reality as it occurs right now. Whether this involves focussing on personal goals or on improving the lot of humanity is irrelevant in my opinion.
     The Stoics (with a capital 'S') espouse an attitude of temperance and wisdom. As well as courage and discipline. These values, as they are developed in a person, create an internal environment of peace. And probably tranquility. While this may seem irrelevant as it seems to stray from the topic at hand, these are fundamental human qualities that contribute to happiness. One's goals, as they are seen in the first person, can very well be internal or external. That is: the mind is in the present and not wasted on reminiscing on some vague past history or daydreaming or being anxious about some future happenings. 
     I guess my point is, as I may be rambling here, that the "happiness of others" actually 'is' a personal goal. And that personal goal is a reasonable goal to look forward to. Some people, especially doting parents or some public servants, actually put the happiness of others ahead of their own personal improvement. I suppose this is fine as long as they're temporally present.
     It's been said that the journey is the best part of a goal. (or something like that, I am paraphrasing). I like to think that as well.
