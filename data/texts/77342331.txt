Every day people are bombarded with colorful images in the advertiszments and packaging that they encounter as they navigate through an ordinary day.  Often these images and impressions that they recieve do not closely resemble the reality of the products, people, and services that the images represent.  Often, the images and impressions that people recieve have a greater effect on them than they should.

In the food service industry, for instance, they employ sophisticated food modelers, sylists, and photographers to make the images of food items look enormous, fresh, and colorful.  The tomatoes in the advertized deluxe cheeseburger are bright red, the lettuce looks freshly picked from a garden, and the bun us a perfect golden color sitting upon the towering stack of ingredients looking regal and composed.  As anyone can attest who has purchased a burger in the past one hundred years, the reality of the deluxe cheeseburger never lives up the the image that has been advertised.  The reality burger is squatter, less fresh and less colorful.  This is the way that reality generally stacks up against advertisement.

People, especially those with an interest in promotion and advertizing, might say that it is necessary to exaggerate the products that are being sold and pictured in order to sell that product and give the consumer an idealized view of the products features.  This practice seems deceptive and dishonest.  Consumers, however, have a responsibility to be aware of these practices and to not allow images and impressions to effect them too much. Similarly, entertainers, polititians, and other public figures appear far more polished and important in their media and promotional material than they are in reality.  The general public must keep this in mind as well and not place to much weight on curated images and promoted imagery.
