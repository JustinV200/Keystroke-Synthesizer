Actually according to me there is no shame in being materialistic, it could benefit the society although materialism always gets bad press. there is always an assumption that people who prioritise things are selfish. its always that highly materialistic people stay in a different world, where there priority is cash, possessions and status. But is this true?
I think there are two sides to the story. Highly materialistic people believe that owning and buying things are necessary means to acheive important life goals, such as happiness, success and desirability.
however in this they always sideline other important things. its always highly materialistic people tends to care less about the environment and other people than non materialists do. I have always seen materialistic people are always selfish and prefer to build meaningful relationships with stuff as opposed to people. 
But on the other hand materialism is a natural part of being human and people develop materialistic tendencies to cope with situations which makes them feel anxious and insecure. 
Materialism is not only found in particularly materialistic people. Anyone can activate materialistic mindset, as materialism is always their part of life no one can just define materialism as you cannot tell anyone to not be materialistic as its been adopted by them its like telling them not to have sex, not to have food, not to drink water, etc. I have always seen people being materialistic and its impossible for us to stop them from being materialistic. But lets just face it as materialism is acquiring mindsets and spending money is source of happiness.
Non-Materialistic people always stay happy without spending they live as there life is going on expectations are very low, happy being themselves.
