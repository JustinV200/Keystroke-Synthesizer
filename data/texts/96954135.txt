     In today's society, don't judge a book by its cover has lost all of its meaning.  What I mean by this is that first impressions are often the basis of knowledge that the majority draw their opinions and thoughts from.  Basically, surface information alone is being used to form an opinion and the stubbornness to stick to that opinion is being ingrained into society.
     Years ago mantras such as "trust, but verify," were used as a way to ensure that someone wasn't hoodwinked into believing a statement presented at face value as a fact.  Now, however, most news employ the method of a catchy headline, regardless of facts.  The media has figured out that the majority of people in society will simply read a headline or an opinion with no facts substantiating the claims made in an article and believe it.  
     There is no deeper dive for information or confirmation.  Confirmation bias emerges in an echo chamber where the different sects of society only read and share news that confirms their beliefs.  When presented with facts that challenge someone's belief, stark outrage and outright indignation follows, and the conversation typically devolves into extremes of conversation.  Often, a person's opponent becomes a miasma to them and no common ground can be found, because both sides refuse to listen to reason.  
     The search for truth is dying on the internet and media is perpetuating these awful tendencies.  If society as a whole continues down this dark path, truth will wither away entirely.  Society is already well on their way down that path, but it is never too late to turn back and seek the light.
