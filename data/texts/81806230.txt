     In our day to day life we run for  only money so we even do not have time to notice the things that arround us.  Advertisement only show how colorful the package but fail to provide proper infromation about that product.  We oftne attracted by colorful advertisemeent and bought the product from the store. We blidnly beelive the election manisfesto of the polticians and fail to recognize theri abililty to govern the nations. It is thebiggest issues facing every nations.  Leaders are selected only by their efficiany not by their eleection manifesto.  
        
    Awareness is the only solution to overcome the probleem. Every person should aware of their own environment,.  Creating awareness among people will lead a good nations.  It is our duty to teach the children of various issues that surround our nations.  Childrens are future building of the nation.  We must construct the building proprtly .
