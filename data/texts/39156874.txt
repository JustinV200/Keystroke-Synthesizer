     There has always been a question about how to get better success.  Does you need to get there with cooperation or maybe competition.  Obviously there are many different things in life that can be acheived.  Perhaps you are trying to win a baseball game with your team.  Maybe you are on a production line and are trying to make your quota for the day on items made.  No matter what the case its a group goal that many people need to work towards.  I feel that cooperation is the best way to get more success. 
      Cooperation is something that is important in a job to move up.  In most cases you will need the help of others in order to move up in the world and you will also need those people to maintain where you are or increase further.  People you befriend and work hard with will support you more than someone you were going toe to toe with to get something.  I can say with the jobs I have held there would be no moving up without those strong individuals who worked along side me to make me look better and for some of them I became a mentor and helped them move up in time as well.  In the sports I have played like baseball you have to have cooperation to get the win.  One person can't do the fielding alone.  Competition while having its place is making the strong stand out can create adverse conditions where people can resent or even sabotauge each other on the way up or while they are waiting to get the position of the person that acheived the higher spot.  
     This is why its better to work together rather then work against each other in jobs and in life.  By working together you get there as a team.  Share in the victory or the defeat but many heads or bodies working together make things easier.  Combind your talents with others to aceive victory in whatever way it is deemed.  This is by far the best way to get to that finish line and aceive your goals.  I wouldn't want any other way to live my life than with cooperation.
