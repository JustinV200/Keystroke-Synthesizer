"What makes me happy?"  This is a question that people have asked themselves countless times throughout their life and one in which some have spent a lifetime in persuit of the answer.   I believe that what makes someone happy is subjective since everyone has diferent values and motivations in life. 

Some people believe that happiness comes from achieving goals that are meaningful to them or when they have a career or lifestyle in which they are doing something they are deeply passionate about.   For other people they obtain happiness by helping others.    And for some people they are most happy through having strong, meaningful relationships with people who they care about it.  Maybe its just a chemical reaction that we have no real control over.   That would explain why there are a few people who cant or might not ever achieve happiness, but that does that they are always sad or discontented with thier lives. 

So happiness must be subjective.   Everyone has to figure out for themselves what makes them happy.   It could take a lifetime of searching or it might come on its own.   But I do not believe that you can fully experience and appreciate happiness without experiencing sadness, depression and discontentment.    How else could you truly know what happiness is?
