            People often focus too much on one area of their life over others. This leads to conflict between what someone does and their own feelings; their happiness can be affected most of all. For example, some people focus way to much on others and not enough on themselves. While this does seem noble, a lot of problems can arise. A middle ground is needed.

          Focusing too much on others inherently means that someone is ignoring their own well-being. It can be extremely draining focusing on everyone else and ignoring yourself in the process. If someone is worried so much about the happiness of everyone else, what happens to them? It could be almost disassociative to feel that way, ultimately making one unhappy and unsatisfied. To the point of only helping others, one loses their inherent desires and feelings of self; defining oneself entirely by others. The exact opposite of only focusing on yourself can be negative as well.
  
        At the same time, focusing too much on yourself can lead to selfishness, narcissim, and outright dsiregard for others. Ignoring other's happiness will only lead to hollow happiness in oneself. This happiness can be almost bitter. How can someone be truly happy when everyone around them is miserable; as the saying says "Misery loves company." Both of these approaches are fundamentally flawed. 

          The clear and obvious answer is to have a middle ground solution; one can take ample time to care for others while not ignoring there own desires. Everyone needs to have time to themselves, it is only natural. At the same time, we are social creatures, we need people around us happy also; else everyone ends up miserable. A healthy dose of helping others, combined with helping yourself, is most efficient in promoting happinesses in an individual.
