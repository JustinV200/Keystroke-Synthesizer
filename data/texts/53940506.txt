I believe people are more likely to be happy when focusing on their own personal goals verses focusing on the happiness of others. You can't focus on the happiness of others rather than your own personal goals because people walk in their own happiness due to their own goals. You should focus on your own personal goals and walk in your own happiness. 

Some people that are be happy are still working and/or focusing on their own personal goals as well. Therefore, if you were to focus on your goals you would be happy too. Focusing on their happiness will not help you with your goals as they are happy for their own reasons.

One should really focus on their own personal goals. Focus on the things that you want to accomplish so that you can achieve them. Focusing on your own personal goals is the same as focusing on your own happiness. When you accomplish your goals you will be happy. No one can take away your goals and accomplishments so that is a happiness you can will have the rest of your life. Focus on your goals and focus own your own happiness. The happiness of others is not yours. You can only accomplish your own personal goals and build your own happiness to focus on as you focus on your goals.
