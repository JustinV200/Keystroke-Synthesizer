I believe most people are intelligent enough to realize that what they see is not usually what they get.  It seems there is a growing consensus that advertisements and news stories are not the truth.  As a person is known by their fruits of whatever they are involved with, the truth usually comes out.  

Any sensible educated human being knows that looks can be deceiving.  If a public figure looks like a movie star, that does not guarantee he or she will do a good job for the people they represent.  I would say look at the results of their labor, look at the broken promises and anything that pertains to them in a negative light.  This is a perfect example of saying "you can't judge a book by it's cover".  

The media counts on the mob mentality because it works.   The abilities or truths revealed by  followers of the media spread the false reality to the world and it becomes "common knowledge".   At that point, someone who knows the reality can argue until they're blue in the face and the believers of the lies will stay steadfast to what was falsely fed to them.  It would affect their ego too much to admit they were wrong.  They defend their product or person of interest regardless of what truths are revealed.  The strange thing is people will defend another person's hidden flaws once they are revealed more than they would defend a failed product.  It's as if they don't want to hear the truth once they fall for the deception.  

To answer this question, yes, images and impressions do have too much of an effect on the simple naive type people.  Thankfully there are those that know better than to blindly follow the crowds.  They are the ones who will search out the truth.  If they reveal it to the world, they will find themselves as a public enemy.  The mainstream does not want those kinds of human beings around.
