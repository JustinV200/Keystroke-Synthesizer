       I feel that when living in a society people should expect to receive some criticism for being materialistic. That isn't to say that all materialism is bad. In fact I believe that some materialism is a healthy way to stay mentally fit and productive in a modern society.
I do believe that materialism can become unhealthy rather quickly and should be criticized is if a person allows it to affect them in a way that they're spending too much money on unnecessary items just to keep up with trends, especially if it is interferring in their ability to stay on budget or pay their bills on time.
       Another reason why materialism can be seen as bad if not being moderated is because of the clearly negative impacts that it has on the environment. The more people feel the need to buy whatever random decoration or trinket that doesn't actually serve a real life purpose, the more these items just fill our landfill and garbages every year, which leads to more ocean and forest polution and in the end the whole planet suffers. I also think that materialism is just a short term solution for people to make themselves feel better in the moment, and not an actual fix to what may be really bothering them.
       Those points aside I do believe that buying certain things to make yourself happy is an essential part of making it through the day to day hardships of living in a capitalist society and shouldn't be overly criticized if done in a responsible and thoughtful way.
Overall as a society we should be critical of materialism or else it will end up creating catastrophic problems both around the world and to our personal well being if left unchecked.
