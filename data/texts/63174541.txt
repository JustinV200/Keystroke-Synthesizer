Materialisim is often mistaken for greed. Greed is the desire for more that is often never satisfied, whereas materialisim is simply taking pleasure in ones posessions.

Materialisim is not a negative personality trait or the downfall of modern society as is it often portrayed. Materialisim is actually a positive trait, because without materialisim, is there any motivation to achieve ones goals?

People ususally have goals of owning a nice home or driving a nice car. Most people achieve this by working hard and earning money to afford a new home or car. Being proud of the things that one has worked for and purchased is not a bad thing, actually, it motivates people to work and provides a sense of accomplishment.

Some people will say that people should not only find happiness in posessions, and while this is true, it is also true that people cannot find happiness without posessions. Can a person be truly happy without any of the things that their peers posess? 

In conclusion, modern sociaty should not be criticized for being materialistic. Materialism may not offer complete happiness, but it can offer a sense of pride and accomplishment to the person that purchased and owns the object. It also motivates people to work in order to afford more items, which may make modern society the most industrious society yet.
