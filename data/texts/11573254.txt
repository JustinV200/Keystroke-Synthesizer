"We are living in an material world and I am a material girl." -Madonna 

You are lying to yourself if you don't think your a material person.  Your phone, your car, all the items that you use or "consume" everyday, are you willing to live without those items? 

You may pass up items that you really want to buy, but there are always going to be items that you need. Essentially, most Americans are materialistic. How can you blame us? We are being constantly fed advertisements on our phones, TV, radio, social media, billboards, ect. Our data is tracked so you are shown ads of items you would probably buy. 

We have home smart devices such as Google Home and the Echo Dot that are on standby listening for keywords you are using so they can advertise products to us. Why do you think these devices are sold to us so cheaply? Not because they want the us to have the information we need quickly, but so they can sell us a bunch of useless crap that makes us happy. Who needs to browse and buy when you can say, Hey Alexa, add to cart or buy now. 

Is that a negative thing? No. Why? Because we love to say money doesnt buy happiness but we keep on buying things that seem to make us happy. We buy gifts for other that sparks joy in them, and who isnt excited when they first open their shiny new phones, or new cars with the latest tech? 

Unless you live off the grid and generally avoid life then you can't escape the consant exposure to advertisements and the temptation to buy.

So yes, I am materialistic, you are matericalistic, our country is materialistic.  We ARE living in a material world and we are all material people. Madonna wasn't afraid to tell us the truth, so lets own our consumerism and admit that money has been known to buy some happiness, even if it's only temporary. Happy shopping!
