    Happiness is always a great thing. Happiness can come from a lot of things. It can come from you being happy for getting an A on a test or winning a competition or even reaching some of your goals. It can also come from someone making you happy or even seeing someone else happy.

   People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. I know it can be hard and you cant always get it the first try. Look at it this way though. Is it better to fail a few times and then reaching that goal and you are happy or would you rather give up after failing once and being unhappy with yourself forever.

    I would definetly prefer to fail the first couple of times and till I pass and am happy. I can actually relate to a time like this. I tried out for the Company Team at my dance studio and didn't make it for 5 years. That next year I went in there with my head held high and knew I was gonna nail it because I practiced and showed how I could do it. I went in there and made it. Those 5 years of not making it and lots of practice paid off because I am happier than ever.

   Focusing on someone elses happiness can actually put you down. You can realize how happy they are while you are miserable. Although its nice to see someone happy you need to be happy as well and that has to come from your goals.

  In the end it is better to be happy from focusing on your personal goals than the happiness of others. Your health and happiness should be the most important to you. Happiness is a great thing.
