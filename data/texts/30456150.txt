           I've always liked the saying, "survival of the fittest." Because of this saying and everyday life examples competition is the way to success. At my work I feel like there is competition in every department between head nurses, nurses, and CNA's. There is also competition in other workplaces.
           First, there is a competition between head nurses, nurses, and CNA's. They are all competing in their own department to see who can work more, who can pick up more hours, who doesn't call in sick, who gets their job done, and who trains new co-workers. Every year we have a yearly examination to see how much we've worked, how well we get along with our co-workers, and how many times we call in. We get 5 points for each subject and there are about 20 questions. The Director of Nursing then adds up these points for our final score. Based on this final score is how much our bonus is. So basically, in this hospital everyone needs to compete and try to be better than the others to get a better bonus. If we all cooperated we wouldn't get as good of a bonus.
           Second, there is a competion in almost every other workplace which leads to success. For example, those with more education, more training, or more volunteering will get the best jobs or will get hired. Also, those that work harder than others, stay longer hours, and get along better with their bosses will get promoted to a higher position.
            Overall, people in a workplace will bring about success with competition rather than cooperation. My examples listed were those that got more points in my workplaces got better raises, and those with more education or training will get the job or better paying jobs.
