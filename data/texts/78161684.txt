Images and impressions do have a great effect on people, but it is not outsized or harmful in itself.  In fact, if being able to see was a detriment, the blind would be envied rather than pitied.  What is more important is developing good judgment on what we allow ourselves to see and focus on.  I would argue that vision is a gift from God that allows for critical thinking, creativity, and a more meaningful interaction with our fellow creatures.

Take, for example, a child learning to read.  Without instruction and guidance, the letters will just be a jumble of lines much less words and sentences.  But, once the skill is learned, the written word is capable of conveying great and profound meaning.  After the basics of reading are learned, logical thinking must be taught in order to be able to judge the merit of the meaning that the author attempted to impart.

Can images and the impressions they leave have too much effect?  Of course.  The slickly packaged politicians, the airbrushed pinups, the latest tech feds all spring immediately to mind.  These are unavoidable unless one chooses to live in a remote area with no access to media of any sort.  Rather than remove oneself from the world, I would advocate for learning the discipline of sifting these images and making quality judgments on what should be dwelt on and what should be discarded.

I cannot say that I do this perfectly myself, but I have found the effort worthwhile.  Having children has heightened my sense of the need for this as my wife and I train them in this.  The bombardment on our sight requires and demands that we "see" clearly else the blind would and should be envied.  A measuring stick for how to do so is a subject for another essay, but I would argue that it has to come from an authority outside ourselves.
