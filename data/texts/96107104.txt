In a world full of competitive people, cooperation has been proven to be the best route to go in order to achieve goals. While being competitive can give an individual a special drive, working as a team can turn out higher quality results.
Coming from someone that lives for competition and working alone, overall I do find it more productive to work in a team setting. I feel that a competitive, lonesome work ethic can be great to a certain extent. However, in most areas, with cooperation from others, you can expand your mind to ideas that you may never have thought of, you can use expertise that you do not possess, and you get the extra push when you want to quit. 
If we look at people in a business setting, we can see that even those at the top need help from others to make things work. There can be a sense of overwhelming feelings when it comes to trying to figure things out on your own. In order to thrive, we need to reduce stress. Allowing others to benefit and help out can create a less toxic work environment. I do understand there are many out there that are not team players. There are many that are, though. Too much intensity within your rivalry can create a hostile breeding ground.
We can even see in our own time how not cooperating on specific issues can cause exteme animosity. Let us think of our political parties. We are always in a human rights war due to not coming together in cooperation. People feel the need to oppose each other and argue rather than expand their minds to possible, valuable solutions.
Overall, I do feel that having others around you who are willing to cooperate and introduce ideas that you may never have thought can end in a greater success rate than just being competitive all on its own.
