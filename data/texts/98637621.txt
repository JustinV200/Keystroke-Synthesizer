What makes someone happy? Maybe for you it's buying that brand new BMW. For someone else, it's working together with friends to raise money for an important cause. For someone else, it's being curled up with a book in front of a fireplace on a cool rainy day. For someone else, it's spending their Thanksgiving handing out hot meals to those less fortunate. Is happiness more likely found by someone focused solely on themself or for someone focused more on others?

I believe both people can be happy in the moment, but those that focus on helping other people will have more satisfying and longer lasting happiness.  When you focus solely on what you want, it will often leave you feeling empty when the moment of enjoyment is over. You are often left with a feeling of vague disappointment and spend your time looking for the next moment when you can experience that brief happiness again. When you focus on helping someone else, you can enjoy the task while also knowing that you are providing joy for someone else too. It can leave you with the satisfaction of knowing you did a good, unselfish thing. You may even receive praise and gratitude from those you help. You can look back on the experience with fondness knowing that your time was well spent. 

Does this mean you shouldn't ever do things solely for your own enjoyment? Of course not. If you can afford that shiny car and it's something you really love, go buy it. If you want to spend your day alone with a book, go do so. Self care is important! But you certainly should not spend the majority of your time and energy with personal happiness as your goal. It seems counterintuitive, but if you shift your focus to others, you will likely find beautiful happiness along the way for yourself too.
