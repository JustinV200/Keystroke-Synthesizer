Are you overly influenced by social signals? Advertizers try to influence your purchases. Celebrities try to influence your entertainment Politicians try to influence your vote. With all of these influences, how can individuals remain independent?

Conformity seems innate. Humans evolved from small groups. Groups strongly influence the members so that a group becomes more similar as members converge. An old sociology rule of thumb that a person will behave like the average of their five closest friends.

Influence is both effective and also inescapable. But is it too much? Some people will succumb to the appearances. These people will follow the social patterns and fads. Other people will reject them. Most will be in the middle of noticing some of the appearances and rejecting some of the appearances. Nobody will see everything.

What's the best method? Some will simplisticly argue that all images and impressions should be eliminated. Of course, such efforts will fail because it is impossible to eliminate everything. A better approach would be to find some of the outside influences and evaluate them for personal worth. People will change their evaluations for which influences are useful, depending on which appearances are relevant, attractive, or proven.

Most appeances are shallow, out dated, or false. People ascribe high worth to pure novelty. An image with novelty is more attractive than an image you have seen many times. The new hamburger looks much better than your old meal. Pretty people use the new product, so it must be better. The other side appears to have greener grass. It is hard to discern the value of something just by looking at its outside.

Appearances do matter. The unkempt recluse in shabby clothes should not be surprised that others stay at a distance.
