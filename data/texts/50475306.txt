How much impact do images and impression have around us? Some can argue that images will guide and change our perception. Other times previous advertisements create impressions to favor their products later on. Do these seemingly small things change our perception of reality?

I would agree that for the vast majority of individuals they influenced by these things. Clever advertisements do create impressions and colorful packages create gravity to them. Colors can be used to create and point to certain moods for a product. They can even be used in clothing for entertainers and politicians to help cast them in a certain light. These small changes to create impressions or ideas all sum up eventually to have individuals buy something or make decisions a certain way. It helps create the comfort of confirming our own biases or swaying those who were on the fence. 

Ultimately, everyone is impacted by clever advertisements, colorful pakcages, and media making out people to be more important than how they can execute. However, it is up to the individual to recognize that their judgement could be comprised and that their biases are being played into. Once they are able to see that, step back and look at just the facts rather than a painting, can someone be less impacted by these items.
