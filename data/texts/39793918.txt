The world is based on the appearances.  

Nowdays, everything is based on appearances, you can see how everybody and everything built by the humans are made to create some kind of impact. However that is not always in a good way.  Sometimes those appearances are made to hide the weaknesses of the product or the human behavior by presenting them like if they were the right choice for us. 

This most of the time is harmful, because it put us out of the reality and is making us think that is the correct way or the best product for us, based just on the appearance, because the society has been working around this for years making us bealive that in order to be accepted of part of that society we need to have "good" appearance, for example they make us bealive that if we drive a luxury car we would appear like we are very succesful, however this is far away from reality.  

In school if somebody is not wearing a high end outfit they think it's out of place, so again the apperances play a huge factor when it should not be like that, because appearances are the most important goal of marketing. How could you launch a succesful product with out nice appearance?   

At the end appearances are just like a fake skin for something or someone.
