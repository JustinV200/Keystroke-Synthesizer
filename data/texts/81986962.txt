Happiness can be found in many ways. I think happiness can be found through focusing on your own personal goals and on the happiness of others. There is really no one or the other in this situation. There are two sides to everything that goes on on the world. I will explain in the following paragraphs what I mean.
 
For the population that thinks that they can be HAPPY by only focusing on themselves,  they can never be happy. To me that's viewed as selfish because the world does not revolve around you. Nothing you do in this life can be done just by you. You need others in the race for improving yourself. Nobody can just focus on themselves and be truly happy, its not likey and damn near impossible. 

For the population of people who can achieve happiness from helping others be happy, will live the greatest lives of all. To get a great paying job or a decent education, you need to make sure everyone in your world is happy, or at least try and maintain some of it. Don't anger your parents, and don't give your teachers stress. You have to treat people accordingly or there will ne no happiness at all, not for anyone on Earth.

So in conclusion, you need to focus on yourself and others if you want to achieve affromentioned happiness. You CAN NOT just focus on yourself and truly be happy. A lonely life is calling if that's the case. Look at it like this, you can't do a lot for yourself in the 1st few years of your life and that person taking care of you must be happy to ensure you grow up with the same morals. Do for you and other people. It's the laws of nature. Everything else is an invention of man.
