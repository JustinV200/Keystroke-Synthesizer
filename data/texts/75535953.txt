      Now-a-days people are made fool by colorful and attractive advertiement by the company and the actors. People should be more aware of this. We should not be get attracted by those advertisement, we should think before we leap. 

     Even children and adults are also get attracted by those advertisement and the actors and by the colorful packages and by the attractive discounts by the stores. If a company is giving a discount without any purpose means there should be a stratergy behind that we should be aware of that. We should not be fond of those discounts by the stores, it may lead to many losses in our side in both mental and physical health.

How should be aware of this?

     We should buy the products as per our needs and not for the colorful advertisment. Everyone should check the product description whether the product contain any toxic contains, If it so report it immediately to food management officers so that  they can take actions against that product manufacturer so that people should get some aware of that product. And we also want to check the expiry dates, it is must and foremost thing while buying food products. 

     By giving awareness among the people we can stop these things. Everyone should be reponsible for this. So we have to be open eyed while buying the products.


                                                  "Think before you leap!"
