
Although a little friendly competition can be a good thing, success is more achieved by cooperation. Working with others to complete a project is a great thing. The more ideas that can come together to create something great is a huge success.

Sometimes when people are competing so hard for the win they lose focus on the main point of what they are trying to complete. They go out of their way to be better than others that the succss of the project is sometimes forgotten.  However, when these two competetors come together and brainstorm they can come up with way better ideas for success.

Lets say two people are trying to build a robot to compete against eachother, one might have strong arms while the other may have fast wheels. Think about what could be if that robot had both of those features combined. Instead of trying to make it better than the other one they could combine all of these ideas and make one fancy robot. 

Instead of competing against eachother lets join forces and make a great robot. Lets pool all of our ideas together and make it the best one that is out there. Together we can be smarter as a team than by ourselves. We will definitely have a way better outcome. Team work is the only way to go.
