When considerig "happiness" and what will make someone truly "happy," one has to first consider what the real definition of "happiness" is.   Although there is likely only one real definition of "happy," that feeling can certainly differ from person to person.  What is it to be truly happy?  It could be defined as finding pleasure or contentment in an action.  But once again, that will differ from person to person.  If one is to focus on their personal goals, they are more likely to find happiness and be truly happy.  

When a person sets a goal in their mind, there is always an ultimate reason and it is likely for gain of some kind.  Why would someone create a personal goal without a positive outcome for themselves?  Once a personal goal is achieved, there always comes some kind of reward, whether it is tangible or just the feeling of satisfaction.  The end result is likely to bring some form of pleasure or contentment regardless.
  
If, on the other hand, a person focuses on the happiness of others or improvement of humanity for their happiness, this is still a focus on their own personal gain.  One could think about it this way: Does altruism truly exist?  Altruism would be doing something for someone else with no expectation of anything in return and no personal gain.   Whatever the situation or circumstance may be, no one can truly be altruistic because in the end, they are getting the satisfaction of doing something for someone else.   So how could someone believe their happiness stems from making others happy?   Is someone really going to try to make others happy without their own personal goal of being happy themselves being the ultimate endpoint?

In conclusion, however one may claim they find true happiness, it is always by focusing on their personal goal.  In some cases, the personal goal may just happen to be helping others.
