        When a task is completed collaboratively, it signifies that everyone involved in the project must work together to avoid disaster. For instance, if we compete with one another during a group project in an effort to finish it first, we may unintentionally make a mistake that makes the team project fail rather than our individual job. The most important aspect of those activities is teamwork, with healthy competition focused on "quality of works," which refers to who does the best work.

        However, a lack of rivalry would not result in more productive work. It results in a certain amount of lethargy and the conviction that they will unquestionably complete the task. It is one of the worst things to do in the work that may lead to the loss of track in the work.  It is crucial to have healthy competition that is conducted without malice.

       Therefore, I would want to stress that in order to be more successful, cooperation is more crucial than competition. I want to thank you once more for providing me the chance to express myself. Enjoy your reading and the rest of your fantastic day. Keep shining and smiling!!!!!!!
