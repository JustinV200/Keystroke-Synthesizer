Materialism in modern society is a serious malady. Capitalism has an ever-tightening grip on modern consumers, due to the increased access advertising agencies have to them through the internet. Searches on browsers are tracked, to help target individual interests - and huge retailers make it very easy to order impulse items and have them shipped to our homes. Will it continue to get worse?

I believe it will. Look at Amazon's Jeff Bezos - he's on track to become the planet's first trillionaire, an almost unbelievable net worth. And that fortune has risen from materialism - society's need for "more and more stuff." Not important things like food or shelter or basic clothing - just trivial and hedonic items for a cheap thrill, one that becomes a habit with diminishing returns.

Of course, many would argue that this new convenience in acquring "stuff" is a good thing for us all. It builds the economy, creates jobs - what could be wrong with that?

I'll tell you what is wrong with that... it's a shallow existence when one equates their happiness with things rather than with ideas / causes that can actually contribute to the common good. It's an old cliche, but "you can't take it with you." Which would you prefer to leave as a legacy - a life full of meaningful accomplishments and relationships... or a house full of material items for your surviving friends and family to deal with?
