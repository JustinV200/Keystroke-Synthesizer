Happiness is found in many ways.  People are more likely to be happy if they focus on something other than their own happiness througout life.  Dreams and goals are established in our adolescent years, and often change as we grow and become exposed to new experiences.  Judgment is frequently used when comparing the success of others with our own to determine if we are truly happy or not.

As we deal with the variables and changes in our daily lives, it is common for our personal goals to and aspirations to fluctuate.  Happiness is not obtained when we meet or achieve these goals, but rather found along the way in our journey through life.  Some might argue that they've found happiness after hitting certain milestones, such as graduating college for example; however, these stepping stones towards success are often few and far between.  Such happiness does not last long while reflecting upon these goals.  The experience of pursuing a degree, enjoying time with classmates, etc. is where we truly achieve happiness as in this example. 

With the modern technology available today, social media has become full of people sharing their own happiness with the world to see.  We often compare our lives to theirs and follow those who bring us pleasant thoughts of happiness that we have in common.  Focusing on the improvement of humanity, and overall happiness shared by others, will allow us as people to find true happiness.  It is not something that can be easily obtained by focusing on our own personal happiness.
