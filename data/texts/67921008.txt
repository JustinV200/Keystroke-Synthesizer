Ever heard of the frase "Do not believe anything you see in tv or social media"? Through out our whole life we have seen countless of advertisments of a range of products. Of couse companies will use tricks to make things look better for their benifet. They do this to get people to buy their products. It is a reason why images and impressions have a great deal of effect on people.

For example, you wake up and the first thing you do is get into social media and all of suddent an advertisment of some delicious breakfast deal pops up right in the moment when you are hungry. Obviously the image has made a great effect towards your decision on where to go get breakfast.

Another example would be that you are in the market on buying some new soccer cleats. You decide to look online at images to see what you would like to get. After looking and making a list you decide to read some reviews to make a final decicion. Obviously you will take a decicion based on other people's impressions  towards them. 

The way we see everything now a days is based on images and impressions because it is so easy to get access to it.
