    I think people acheive more success by competition because compition is the boost for people success because its give motivation for success and give knowledge about how to successed and the compition is main tool in people go to the high place and compition motivate you go to the high place and compition is very useful to go to the first place. all industries has compition so be prepare for that so work hard for that and compition between friends is very good because its very helpful to grow and its also very healthy. these are positive things of compition
     now we talk about negative side of compition. the main point is some times compition makes Ego between friends and collages and Ego is very very dangerous thing in the world so be aware from that. some peoples are take compition negative they take it very seriously so they are thing that competiters are enemy of personal so its made very dangerous thing in the world so be careful from this. these are negative side of the competition 
      now we discuss about cooperation. cooperation is very good but its don't improve our personal growth and knowledge. team work is very good but team works very bad when development of the personal growth so I don't choose cooperation in these option. people like achieve more then follow the process of compition and don't follow the cooperation
