                                                             Happiness means that when someone happy with done or achieve something. Some peoples are trying their own success and victory to feel happy and in this way they make a world of happiness. A few number of peoples happiness comes from others success and acheivement they don't worried about their own victory. These two type of people we usually see in our society. These two type of people are living in our society we uasually see that a large number of people happiness is aceiving their own goals but a few number of peoples are different.

                                                         Nowadays a large number of people in our society trying to win their own personal dreams and goals and they think that when happiness comes from this. This type of people are only think about themself only not worried about other happiness and others victory. But a few peoples thinks that when happiness comes from others achievement and others dream will true. These type of people don't worried and care about their own goals and dreams. If they fail in their dreams they not bothered about that their only focus is happiness of others in this way they find their own happiness. 

                                                      In my opinion when happiness comes from pursuing own deams and own acheivemnt these type of peoples create a new world of ego and selfishness. This type of people do anything for their own happiness if someone or a group of people hurt by them they do not care and don't bothered about that. Their only focus is their own happiness. But the others are different they think that when happiness comes from makes others happy and to help others to achieve their dreams and goals. The se type of people make a wonderful society and a good humanbeing. They mekes a helping minded next generation.
