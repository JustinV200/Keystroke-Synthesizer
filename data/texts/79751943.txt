Like it or not, materialism is an important part of our culture we live in a global, commercialized, materialistic society. I think over time, we've headed this way and have reached the point where things have gone too far. Like many things, I think there is a balance but as a whole we are too materialistic. 

Generally speaking, we as a whole are too focused on materials, and less so on our well-being and it is affecting us as a whole society. Though material objects are important to some extent no matter who you are, I think a return to the person / happiness is what we need. Our current generations are driven by the constant drive for more, more, more and eventually this will cost us. We are becoming less happy and ruining the envrionment in the process, highlighting a need for change, sooner rather than later. Eventually, we will run out of the resources and energy allotted to us on our quest for more and more - we willl be left to face the question, was it all worth it? 

Our current, singular focus is to create more, earn more, buy more which spurs us to spend the extra we earn so we work more to earn and acquire more. Though we need material things to live, and it isn't a sin to want nice things - however currently the material represents the driver behind our society and economy. This leads us to be wasteful as we race from one new thing to another. 

Ultimately, we are due for a change. If we don't make the changes to the way we live, they'll be forced upon us as we outgrow our space on our quest for 'more' and 'happiness.' Eventually, we'll take and take and take until there is nothing left to give.
