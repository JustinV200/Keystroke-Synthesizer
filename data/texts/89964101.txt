I believe that happiness will comes from when one achieve their goals in their life. It will get more happiness and wealthy life. And some will beleive that be happiness will  comes only when we fix the goals to attain in life. Both the things will get happiness in everyone's life. Some will get happiness when trying out new things and optaining money.

When peoples believing that happiness comes by pursuing their dreams and their own personals goals, they will work hard without get any distracts. They will fix their goals and ran behind that without any confusion. And they will definitely get that certain goals and it will eneded up with wealthy credits and happiness. They do not fall under any pressures and stress. They will focus on their dreams and get it done at right time.

Some will get happy only when they have their minds fixed to optain happiness from living theri own life. but they do not fix any certain goals to optain in life. they live through the day to day life, they get satisfied with what they have ,they do not like to achieve or dreaming about goals. Everyone has their unique personality of lifes and various reasons to get happiness. And I strongly belive that the HAPPINESS is the key for an successful life, whatever it is be happy with what you have in your life, that will definitely bring all the good things and good values to your life. The happiness can be either focusing on dreams or can be happy with what we have everything will make our life successful.
