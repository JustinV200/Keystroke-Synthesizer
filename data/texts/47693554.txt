     Without doubt, a workplace or a playground that encourages competition over cooperation is a breeding ground for toxicity, and this will ultimately culminate in promoting enmity between and among workers or individuals involved in the game. Cooperation on the other hand, not only would yield immediate positive results at the workplace, but also create a lasting peaceful environment where all workers would feel welcomed, where opinions and ideas get shared without fear which would further booost the output of everyone involved.

     A general saying goes thus 'Unity is strength. United we stand, and divided we fall.' This further goes to show how important it is for people who work in an environment to come together in unity to achieve a common set goal, without being under unnecessary pressure to outperform a coworker. Through cooperation, it becomes easier to work towards achieving a common goal, with everyone chipping in their bits and piece. Hence, by contributing their own quota, a lot gets achieved within a short time.

     In addition, the most important reason why cooperation trumps competitveness is because cooperation promotes teamwork. It is said that 'there is no I in team', the success of the team trumps any individual achievement, this plays out positively because individuals will be encouraged to share information with other team members, without seeing a coworker as a rival. People would come together without trying to sabotage the effort of the next man. 

     Conclusively, the long term benefits of cooperation at any given place and at any given time canot be overemphasized, this is because cooperation breeds friendship, the spirit of comradeship, promotes oneness with each team member seeing the other more as a friend than a foe, and ensuring that they all work to achieve more together.
