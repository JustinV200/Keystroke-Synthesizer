How do you get the most out of the people who work for you? This is a question that all leaders must ask themselves early in their career. Promoting cooperation among your people, as opposed to competition, will yeild the greatest success over-all.

While a competitve environment can spur certain people to do their best, it also can create a very hostile enviroment for the majority of people who do not thrive in that kind of setting. Ideas can get lost, the loudest voice wins, and other people can become discouraged if they feel they can never rise to the top. By fostering cooperation, managers can show their team that each person and each person's opinions are valued. Sometimes the most brilliant ideas can come from unlikely sources, and by fostering an environment that encourages cooperation, ideas can be generated and built upon through group discussion to become even greater. Potential pitfalls can also be discoverd and addressed early in the planning process. Cooperation encourages flexibility and empathy among coworkers/teammates as well as being able to celebrate victories collectively.  These benefits of cooperation greatly enhance a person's sense of value, which equals greater employee satisfaction, which in turn leads to greater employee retention. Valued employees will stay when a dissatisfied employee will seek employment elsewhere. This saves a company money in the long run, as training new employees is very costly and can disrupt an established team. 
 
A manager who wants the best results for their company and the greatest satisfaction of their employees should encourage cooperation over competition. It truly is a win-win scenario.
