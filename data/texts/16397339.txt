I believe images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. I see it everyday on televison, on soical media, and many other places. People think what they see on the outside is better than what they get from the inside. I have always believed the saying you don't judge a book by its cover.

Our society has become one focused on what someone looks like or who is endorsing a product rather than a persons personality or how well the product works or its ingredients. Say someone sees an ad but it doesn't have an attractive or famous face on it, do you think they are likely to be interested in the ad? I don't think so. Now say someone sees an ad for a car insurance and the person presenting the ad is famous. In most peoples minds they think 'well if this famous person says its a good insurance then it must be true', instead of doing their research about the company and comparing them to others.
 
Now I agree seeing a famous person endorsing a product or service does give it an appeal but they are being paid to endorse this product or service. People are becoming narrow minded about their perseptions and looking at all the wrong areas. What is on the inside is far more important than what is on the outside. Also, you can't trust a company just beacuse a famous person is saying they are trustworthy. We must do our research and open our minds or we will be doomed to making many mistakes in the future.
