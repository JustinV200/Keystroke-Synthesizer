I am currently an independant worker as a real estate agent, as well as a business owner for interior decorating, I work in a large city where the competition is thick in every industry. I have also worked as an employee in different fields of work over the last fifteen years such as, continuous improvement leader, production lead, bakery supervisor in a store & a shift supervisor in fast food. 

In my experiance over the years, when it comes to the thoughts around whether competition or cooperation produces greater significance and lasting accomplishments, I believe it has to be a good mixture of the two. In all of my roles I went into them at the bottom, just taking a job to get a job, but I always put in extra effort to get myself into leadership roles. In a way I had to compete and do better that what others were doing to be noticed, what set me apart from others though was not that I could always do better in numbers though, it was more so that I was more willing to be a better team player & help in all areas that I could so a whole shift would do better not just me. When it comes to being a business owner and an independant real estate agent, I am competing to better serve my clients than others can in these industries. I also make lasting connections with others in my field to share information in cooperation of the greater good.

So in my theory you need to balance both competition and cooperation in a selfless manner to make lasting accomplishments. If you are only competing there becomes an arrogance that will push people away in the long run and to only be cooperative can lead to being walked all over. Balance the two and real strides will be made!
