Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you could feel complete happiness? You can, you can reach that goal by focusing on yourself and your personal goals. Did you know if you didn't have the stress of pleasing other people or worrying about other people's problems and focused on just you, you would be more fullfilled.  I read in a artical once that people who focus on themseleves and make progress in their goals in life are generally happier people. I also know this from personal expericence. 
I used to be a people pleaser I thought if I took the time to help others, I'd feel more satified in life. I was wrong. It was more of a distraction than making me happy. I thought seeing others happy would make me happy, and don't get me wrong, it did. But I always felt something was missing. I was always helping others reach their goals that I was missing out on mine. You might think I can do both. If you do both you will be slowing yourself down in life. So I tried it, I stopped saying yes to everyone and focused on me. I wanted to lose weight a lot of it and feel good about myself.  I started by not saying yes to everyone who needed help. That gave me more free time to go to the gym, shop for healthy food, and not drink. When I started to see the weight come off I felt amazing. I had never felt so accomplished and so good about myself. I started to realize I was more important than the people around me. I started to make a healthier lifestyle for my self and I felt the difference. I was happier, I felt less foggy, I was accomplishing so much more. It was the switch I needed. 
In life I feel like there needs to a be balance. But you should always come first. You should always put your goals and dreams above everyone else. Because if dont how will you ever be happy? Learn to find your rythem before trying to help others find theirs. It will help you grow more and feel more fullfilled.
