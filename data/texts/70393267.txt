Happiness can mean many things to different people. Some people can find happiness in their work, families or hobbies, whereas others can derive happiness from helping others. I believe that true happiness comes from a mixture of the two, by having a balanced approach to life.  By balancing one's own personal and professional life, people can experience happiness in several areas.

People can choose career paths that they enjoy enducing one's happiness such as education, medicine, non-profit endeavors, arts, and sports. When people choose to incorporate hobbies into their careers, they are less stressed and anxious and get to spend time doing something they truly enjoy while reaping monetary rewards. People can also choose to focus on their personal lives by spending time with family, helping others less fortunate, or engaging in activities that they find fun and amusing, enducing happiness.  School teachers are often drawn to the field because of their love for children, or learning. Medical professionals often choose the field not because of money, but rather the need to help and care for others. People are often drawn to public service because of a strong desire to help humanity in general. Athletes are attracted to competition and can find happiness in sports.

Emotions differ between individuals as do specific interests. Some people may choose to focus on selfish needs while others prefer to focus on selflessness. These specific interests that one chooses to focus on is the main reason that happiness differs between individuals. There is no one right or wrong way to be happy, it is up to the interpretation of the individual. It is not more or less important for a person to focus on specific needs, but rather what feels right or wrong to them. A person can find many different ways to arouse positive emotions and should be left to determine their preference on their own.
