     We all have wants and desires in this world; often times they take a tangible form. In our consumer-centric, capitalist society, materialism drives much of our economy. People more and more identify themselves with the things they possess. So much so, that that drive to possess has dominated most of our thinking such that possession has become the driving factor of our society, to the detriment of other qualities we could be focusing on.

     Our media is saturated with things to buy. Much of our TV programming is materialism-focused. Whole networks are programmed with shows about home buying and home renovations, each one driving a desire to buy more stuff for ones home, or spend more on a new home. Then there are networks based around families or groups of friends who flaunt their possessions and pimp their own lines of consumer objects, pushing to the watchers the notion that by buying what they have, what they sell, the viewer can be a bit like the people the are watching. It's a peddling of viewers aspirations through materialism.

     "Fame" and ones desire to have a piece of that also drives our materialistic desires. Wear what they are wearing, drive what they are driving, eat what they eat. It drives how people act, how they spend. Peoples whole focus becomes spending and owning. 

     But all the buying comes with costs. The more we produce, the more waste is produced. Not just from discarded possessions, but from the process of constantly making new things. Objects that could continue to be used are trashed in favor of the new hotness. Sometimes manufactures themselves make still useful products obsolete, in order to drive further spending.
