They say money is the root of all eveil, they also say money makes the world go round.  So what is what? is having alot of money to buy material things a good or a bad thing?modern society is becaoming so obsessed with materialism, people are agressive in seeking material gains at the expense of others and thier health.
I am going to discuss it in two ways, one I want to say that materialism is a good thing,  a person needs to be focused on seeking materail wealth, this is because material things make life easy. it makes life enjoyable and meaningful when you can be able to get things you need for you and your family. The focus on materialism helps one to focus and work hard to gain money to be able to afford material things, a house, a car, clothing and all the nice things. 
The second thing I am going to discuss is the negative effect of materialism. Materialism has led to people hurting others and themselves in the process. People are working too many jobs in poor conditions to get material gains, people are robbing and killing others for material gain, this makes materialism a bad thing.
In conclusion Materialism is good if directed to proper use and benefiting people to live a good life. On the other hand it is bad and should be criticized if it leads to harm.
