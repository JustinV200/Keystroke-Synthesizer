Does happiness come from your own personal goals, or does it come from focusing on making others happy? Well, I believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals as opposed to focusing on the hapiness of others. If people focus on the happiness of others, then in my experience they will never accomplish their own goals and will not feel accomplished. Accomplishments and the the strive to always do better is the root of happiness in my opinion. Once you reach those goals you will feel fullfilled and happy.

In my personal experience, I was not happy growing up. I didn't have many friends and all I did was go to school and play video games. After High School I decided to join the military. It was the best decision I made. After boot camp I was the happiest I had ever been becuase I completed something hard and something not all people can do. I also came out with more confidence and the ability to make more friends. And having people around you is another source of happiness.

Some people think that making other people happy will make you happy as well. While that is true, I belive that happiness is fleeting and will not stick with you  forever as the happines you experience when you accomplish something yourself. For example, if my friend were to have my same experience and graduate boot camp I would be happy for him, but the happines could not be measured to the amount of happiness you get from completing it yourself. So in the end, accomplishing your own goals and trying to do better day by day will make you the happiest a person can be.
