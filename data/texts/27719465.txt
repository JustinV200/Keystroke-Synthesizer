   One's happiness can often be attributed to their own effort, their hard work, and perserverance. On the other side there are those that find their own joy in the pursuit of anothers happiness. It is in this dedication to another that i believe someone can find their purpose, and fulfillment. In todays society a lot of the very things that stagnate our personal growth have only served to isolate us further from each other.
    Today's social media is designed to keep their users on the site or app for long periods of time. This has caused those who have grown up with these apps to become more focused on themselves. We are a social species and we need interaction and community. We get so caught up in our faults and why we cannot make ourselves better. Focusing on the betterment of our fellow man will not only give us a purpose to stride towards, it will also stop us from hyper-focusing on our insecurities and possible perceived failures.
    Others would say that the need for community and reciprocated help is not necessary to ones future goals and happiness. Some believe that if one does not "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" that they will never be able to get out of their slump. The idea of "if you work hard you will obtain your own happiness" was always just a trick to motivate the workers in their society. The selfless want to help others, and to take joy in the creation of a better society has always been an ultimate goal of man.
     There definitely is a trend of higher amounts of depression and hopelessness in those that have become isolated and lead to think only of themselves. It is with this conclusion that i believe that helping others is the greatest way of not only fulfilling ones goals, but also giving themselves a purpose. I do believe that these changes are happening today with society, and i for one cannot wait to see them come to fruition.
