               Yes, modern society should be criticized for being too much materialistic. Cause in the society a person should be attached to humans not to objects, we can't be happy by being with objects as they won't helps. As a human we need love and caring an object can't give you those. In this modern society everyone is busy with their lives and career, effections between humans is decreasing day-to-day. 
               So being a materialistic person in this modern society will leave you alone. Every human being is supposed to help each other and care for each other. But being a materialistic person you won't be able to attach with other people as you are not attracted to them. When you got a problem no material in this world going to help you , only a person could do that. 
                So it is nothing wrong being a materialistic person, but being too much materialistic is wrong and it is going to make you apart from the human kind. Be with everyone and make effections among humans instead of materials. Love and effecitons are received and given by spirtual things only. Objects cannot do so, It is more advantage to spend money and energy on a person instead of a material.
