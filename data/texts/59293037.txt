Competition and cooperation are two very prominent things in the world. Both can lead to people achieve their goals or desired outcomes. Different people may prefer one or the other or possibly even embrace both.

In my personal experience I believe that cooperation is much effective for achieving accomplishments in life. I feel that competition can create to much pressure and stress and lead to bad outcomes. Therefore, I think cooperation is much better than competition. When I work with others and cooperate others I feel strong bonds and feel very good to work together. It is possible to accomplish difficult and challenging tasks if we work together as a cooperative group. Harmony is a very powerful thing and can lead to achieving things that are not normally achievable by yourself or by being in competition with others. If there is cooperation and everyone gets along, the process is very smooth and positive. Competition can create a lot of negativity and lead to undesirable outcomes. It can make people not think clearly, whereas cooperation there is great clarity and a great deal of ideas to work with among the group.

While competition may drive people to succeed, I think it also has many negatives. I think cooperation is better than competition because of this. Cooperation allows people to grow and learn and achieve things together in a positive manner.
