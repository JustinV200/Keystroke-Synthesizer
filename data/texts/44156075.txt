In today's society, a slight issue that plagues us, especially the younger generation, is the constant grasp for wealth and material generation. We have become a society that basis much of our own happiness and judgements of others on what we have in our current possession.  Oftimes, we use our possessions and wealth and a symbol of our class and position of the hierarchy.  Are we devolving into the ways of the past, because we no longer see the wealth outside of material and money? It's something intriguing to think that we might be stuck in a loop. 

Take for example, a simple material possession such as a car. Have a luxurious car has been seen a symbol of success and wealth. An eager need to not only have the perception of us that we have a higher position in life, but to also have an inward view and sense of pride. Certainly, if all of us were given the chance, we would all want to ride in a luxurious car, perhaps even driven by our own personal driver. Does it always have to be about the outward projection and not that inner pride? Being judgemental of an individual for being able to afford, or put forth the energy required to consume those items, is not the stepping stone in order to acquire them yourself.

Modern society should be able to relish in the fact that we can obtain such pleasures without the amount of sacrifice that it would have required in the past. Now, more than ever, are we faced with opportunities to climb that ladder of success, not facing the challenges we would have in previous decades. We should not be criticized for enjoying the pleasures in life, as long as we do not use them to directly affect those around us, and to keep them below us. Let's enjoy the things that have been given to us by the rise of civilization, its technologies, and opportunities.
