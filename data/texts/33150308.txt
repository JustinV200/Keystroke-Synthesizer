Happiness and selfishness do not have to be opposite constructs. In order to improve humanity, and yourself, you must first learn to make yourself happy. This may be the hardest lesson in life for people to learn. John Lennon wrote, in a famous Beatles song, "Happiness is a warm gun." What he meant by this is; that it is a slippery slope in human interaction for intermingling people to strike a balance with each other's well being.
  So to start, one must become selfish in the pursuit of one's own heart. Not what one's think happiness is, or how they should go about pursuing it, but they should become themselves and listen to what makes them happy. In our modern times everything is visual and there are vibratory stimulations layered upon layered stacked in three dimensions. But our body tells us when we are happy or not. And we feel this "happiness" when there is no stress on the nervous system, when the muscles and limbs are healthy, and their are no chronic phyical or pyschological problems. Being happy is not as important as being calm, cool, and collected. (That's not plagiarism that's a cliche and I can use it an essay! I've read the New York Times!)
  Right and wrong are dichotomy's just as happiness and well-being are. If it makes a person happy, it should not make another person unhappy. People use words and twist them. This is facts that are unciteable but true. What is important than thoughts and opinions upon  happiness is the feelings and actions that goes along with one's personal pursuits. In an ideal world, a happy person who is one living their own dream and allowing the other people in their lives to, as well.
