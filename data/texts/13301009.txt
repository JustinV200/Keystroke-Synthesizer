Competition or cooperation both are a good way to achieve success, competition can motivate people to push past their limit where cooperation can help people achieve something with an united effort. Individual ability plays a major role in this scenario. If someone has a specific skill for a job they might not perform as well as they were in the specific skill job. Thats where the cooperation part comes in.

We humans are social beings. In order to survive we need help of other people. Thats how society came to be, through the united cooperation of human. Cooperation can be a great way to achieve success. But personal growth is sharply reduced due to people relying on others, it's not wrong to rely on others but to grow more sometimes you need that push to go forward. And competition does exactly that. Having a good rival can be more benificial than 100 friends, because your rival will continuosly will try to get you out of your comfort zone and thus you will grow while achieving success. Managing a team of people can be a daunting task, so in some cases competition can be an excellent way of achieving success.

But looking at the sheer differences between them one can easily see that cooperation is the way to go. We humans have achieved all we have so far by cooperating with each other, now that if you ask me is a huge success. We can gain so much more by cooperating with others than just selfishly looking out for personal growth and competing with others. So in conclusion we can say that people can and will achieve more by cooperating with each other, history shows us the perfect example of that.
