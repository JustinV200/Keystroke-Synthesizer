Many people wonder where exactly happiness comes from.  They wonder if is comes from their own personal goals or if it comes from focusing on the happiness of others.  I believe that happiness comes from focusing on ones own personal goals for many reasons.

Focusing on ones own personal goals is the way to find happiness because it is something that you are in control of. Being able to set goals for you to work towards important to everyone.  Whether it be a work goal or a some goal at home once the goal is accomplished there is a sense of accomplishment that makes a person feel better.

A persons happiness cannot be based on the happiness of others.  This is because no matter how hard you try some people are not going to be happy because of something else that someone else does for them.  Depending your own happiness on that of someone elses would make it very hard because you don't have an identity of your own.

This all comes back to needing to focus on personal happiness rather than others happiness.  If a person is not happy by what they have going on in their life they will never be happy no matter what others do for them.  This is because the goals that they are trying to attain for themselves have not been reached.
