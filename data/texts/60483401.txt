If I were asked, whether the mordern society should be criticized of being materialistic?, definitely I would say "Yes". In the modern day world people are just running behind the money and not even spending time for their loved ones. They think that they are running just to earn money to make their loved ones comfortable and happy, but they don't realize that their loved ones are longing for their love and care. 

Yes, definitely money is important to lead a happy life. It is not good to be materialistic in order to earn. Money just drives the human to be more materialistic. They loose their own identity of being happy and giving care to the neighborhood. I recent days people were started live on social media which is very fake and totally materialistic. There is no life or love, just they were acting  infront of the world.

To look outside one may think being materialistic is good, as love always gives pain when you loose them. But just think, the "love" is only the driving force that keeps the earth still alive. Beigh materialistic may seem to be boom, luxurious and gives high status, but only loving and being loved will give happiness from the depth of your heart. So, I conclude that being materialistic is definitely criticized.
