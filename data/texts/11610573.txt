I sometimes feel like trying to focus on your own happiness depends on what is going on and if it's something you want to keep on going. But if there's some things that you might like, but later lost interest, I feel like it's best to stop until you feel better about yourself. There are times I feel like I want to get my own goals to be happy, or there are times I might give up.

Here's some examples I had outside of work. Throughout the times I was back into the Mr. Men fandom in 2017, there were a lot of projects that I wanted to get done as I had a lot of good ideas thanks to some of the people there. But there were some ideas I had to skip over as either it was too hard to get off the ground, or I have other thing I wanted to get done.

In terms of work, I wante to help archive as much pages to perserve as much content that might get lost overtime. This is mostly on DeviantArt as there were a lot of artists that might leave. Though it's often hard as Archive might not work at times. I sometimes put that on the wayside as I want to get other things done with.

I think trying to find your own happiness on either personal goals or making others happy depends on what is happening at the time. If you have the motivation to make yourself feel better, then you can go with it. But if you feel happy helping others, then that is okay as well.
