The happiness of others will always be the winning, driving force of human nature over the happiness of self. Our inherent nature to please and to never be alone can only be a craving satisfied through constant reassurance that we too are loved and not alone. Even the most heinous person desires to be loved and wanted.
While some of us seem more self centered than others, time and time again human beings have proven that we are in need of human interaction. We have to be needed, wanted and loved in order for us to thrive in civilization in a manner that everyone deems is sufficient in our society. There are some who do not want to believe this and will choose to buck the system to refute this and prove their own skewed points, but show that person love and compassion and they will bend to the will of societal pressure like any other warm blooded being with a pulse would.
Love will prevail and happiness is a given when we are content in our own lives and with ourselves. So, while I said before it is inherent in us to serve others and be here for others, that means we must serve ourselves first all that we want to give others so that we can continue to give to others. 
Ultimately, human beings are responsible for their own happiness, for our own happiness. But we will not stop feeling for and giving up our time, money and skills for others. We need each other and should always be able to rely on each other.
At the end of the day, we are one, we are of God and helping our selves is good for us and the human race as much as is helping others. I look forward to the day that we all come together in unity over this very concept. I'm all in and am developing considerate and compassionate children who will carry out these ideals as well.
