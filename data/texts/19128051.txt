what is materialism ? well , the dictionary of oxford said, "a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual value".

let's say someone's goal is to earn a lot of money so he can earn a lot of money and lead a luxurious life by buying a lot of materialistic stuff, if we hear this from somone we praise them a lot and we gonna say he's on a right track.
 same situation at different stage of life , a 60 year old have already some millions and his goal is to be a billionaire and wants to own a private jet , what people gonna say's that he is greedy , he is being materliastic and something

should modern society be criticized for being materialistic ? i guess not , the world's changing and you need to change as well , the modern citizens are required to be materialistic for to reach the new hights and stand out in the crowd.

you are not gonna succeed being spiritual , your mental health is need to healthy , i do agree with it , but staying in some spiritual void where you go nowhere in the life ? it's not going to do any good for anyone,even for yourself .


so what i'm finally going to say is modern people shouldn't be criticized for being materialistic, infact they should praised and encouraged for being materialstic which mostly ends up in them being successful and reaching goddamn new hights.

so that's me, that's what i think.
