       Organisations in the world today are coming up with many ways of awarding their employees in respect to their competence in the field they are working in and even doing perfomane appraisals inorder to promote some to higher job groups. However in my view most organisations are adopting cooperation as the main measure of promoting employees.
      I feel that coopration is the best measure to promote people because if people cooparate the organisation can be able to increase its output as it encourages exchange of ideas and making sure the best idea is taken into account and used to realize the organisation goals
          Also, cooporation promotes team work and employees will learn from one another in terms of the skills each person has acquired in different fields.This will help someone to be more knowlegble in the organisation unlike competition which can bring jeoulous and even people not to focus on the reality but on the price  to be awarded, that is,promotion.
   Cooporation brings diverse talents together unlike compettition where one is just independent and cannot be able to solve  a problem if he or she is stuck somewhere.
cooporation is the best way of rewarding employeers and it should work hand in hand with competition to bring about output in any given organisation  because if their is no cooporation  among workers then the organisation will end up going down because their will be no unity of purpose among the employees which will make the organisation to fail in its objectives.
