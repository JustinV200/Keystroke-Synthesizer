Different people tend to be happier for different reasons. Some people like to rely on their own goals in order achieve said happiness. Other people really get joy from showing affection to others and other people's happiness is what make themselves happier. People are generally born good human beings, so most people will achieve a happier lifestyle if they focus on everyone else's happiness. 

People like other's happiness when it is a direct result from their own actions. At Christmas time or birthday celebrations, there is such a string of excitement one obtains for buying a gift for someone and watching them open it and see their face light up. It feels nice when someone acknowledges the thought and time a person put in for a gift or action.


On another hand, it is nice nice to focus on your own goals and successes to achieve happiness. Some people that are often referred to as people pleasers can sometimes get burnt out on always worrying and focusing on other people's needs instead of their own so it is important to find ways to have a healthy balance. 

In conlusion, people are good by nature and they get a thrill by helping others. However, it is necessesary to take some time and focus on yourself every once in a while so you're not at risk of resenting the other people.
