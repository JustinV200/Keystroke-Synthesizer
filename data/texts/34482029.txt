     According to me achievement is based on both cooperation as well as competition.
here, iam going to explain both how cooperation and competition makes people for their sucessful achievement.
there are two types of people.the main aim of the people is to achieve their sucessful target.
     one set of people will focus on competiting with others . because, the competition will take people to trigger their mind to come first while comparing with their competitiors.
competition's will keep on motivating and encouraging the people's forever.
      the another set of people will focus on cooperating in the particular tasks to achieve their success.cooperating one another will take their mind peaceful and relaxed. that will take to achieve their sucess.many people will competite one another to achieve for sucess. cooperating with one another is rare.due to their ego they are not ready to cooperate with one another. they are taking this as competition so, far their mindset is that they are living in competitive world. but, both leads to success their achievement.
i hope that i had cleared mindset to analyse a decision for this achievement of people . 
        finally, what My decision is that both coopertion and competition both takes to achieve success its all based on people's mindset.
cooperation and competition both have equal level to achieve more success  to people.
