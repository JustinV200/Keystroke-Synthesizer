Materialism has received a great deal of attention over the decades, and most of the attention has not been flattering. Materialism has been seen as a force that has degraded the culture of America and other societies. In this essay I will argue that materialism is neither good nor bad, but simply a fact of life that should be dealt with as creatively as possible.
To start with, it should be noted that materialism certainly has a dark side. A fixation on material goods often leads to greed and superficiality. But the aim of aquiring new things also has a productive side. The quest to invent innovative products has driven technological and scientific change, but this might not have happened if not for the desire of the public to buy the newest gadget. Would we live in a world of high-tech innovation if it wasn't for materialism? Maybe not. The public appetite to spend money also provides a stimulus to the economy. What business can survive without customers?
Finally, I recognize that critics of this view will not be convinced. They might argue that any benefits of materialism do not make up for the social damage inflicted by our obsession with commercialism. It is not my aim to refute these claims. As I stated earlier, materialism unquestionably has its flaws. I am suggesting, however, that materialism should be utilized for whatever good we can extract from it. Materialism is just a tool, and it is up to us whether it is used for good or evil.
