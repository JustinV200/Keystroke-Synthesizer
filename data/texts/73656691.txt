Materialism is almost expected in our culture these days. If you buck the trend of acquiring all the newest gadgets, you are considered weird or possibly even poor.   I have personally struggled with this myself.  I love innovation in all its forms. I get excited by the genius that creates new tech and I love to see things in action.  I have definitely fallen for feeling that I needed the latest, greatest phone or TV.  Did it ever truly fulfill anything for me though? 

The answer to that is a resounding NO. I feel like people from all different socioeconomic groups fall victim to this. Parents even buy their kids brand new iphones before 10. This is materialism at its scariest.  I do worry about criticizing people for being materialistic because it comes from a place of lack in their life.  People are trying to fill a void. Criticizing someone for something that is likely traumatic is not helpful. 

Some might say there is nothing wrong with acquiring the latest and greatest things. That it drives the economy.  If people didn't keep buying these things innovation wouldn't move forward and we wouldn't progress as a society.  I feel thats a load of hoopla. I think companies would start being smarter about their upgrades and stop with putting out the same product in a different package.  

I feel that materialism will exist for a while until people work on themselves and what they feel they are lacking in their life.  I am not perfect, but I strive to be better than the day before every day.
