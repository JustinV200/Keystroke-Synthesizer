Is materialism in our current society becoming more prevelant? It certainly seems so. What with new technoligies emerging at an ever increasing rate, it seems that almost as soon as something new and exciting is released into the marketplace, it becomes outdated and replaced with something just a bit better.

This is certainly the case with electronic devices and to a lesser extent with clothing, brands, software, vehicles, and a plethora of other products and consumables. I believe that we as a society attach too much importance to material posessions. People have felt a need to "keep up with the Jones's" for many years. This is also known as "conspicuous consumption" and affects quite a large percentage of the population. Step back for a moment and think about how many items you own that you no longer use. Slow down on unneccessary purchases. Stop impulse buying, or at least think about the long-term use you may get from that product you just had to have.

Chances are you support environmental responsibility and sustainability. I know you love new things, and sure buy something you enjoy, occassionaly, but, we each have a duty to Mother Earth to reduce our impact on the environment. Buying less frivolous and uneccessary things will go a long way towards reducing our carbon footprint not to mention keeping our landfills from overflowing with needless waste. Do your part to reduce your impact. Purchase wisely.
