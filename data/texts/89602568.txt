We live in a world where judging a book by the cover has become a norm, ironically, going counter to the popular saying, "Do not judge a book by its cover". Alas, it is a reflection of the prevalent societal values of the times we live in. It cannot be denied that first impressions are important but only if they are a precursor to the main course not at the cost of it!

Appearances have definitely taken center stage of late and the focus of most industries is on the facade and packaging with an eye on profit by roping in as many customers and consumers as possible by cashing on the glam and glitz factor while compromising on the quality of the actual product or service offered. How many times have we felt ripped off by buying something that looked high end only to find that we were blinded by the veneer that covered up a sub standard substance much like the celebrities and politicians that lure us in with their promises come election time but fail to deliver when its time for the rubber to meet the road....

It is about time that we wisen up to this craze and catch ourselves from falling for the images and impressions that have the power to seduce us and instead stay sober and learn to assess consumer goods as well as public figures on the basis of true substance and performance in the long run. The more people stop pandering to and falling for these cheap tricks of industrial and media giants, the more we will be sending them a message to start getting their act together.... and focus on the genuine article, the authentic product and the true substance!
