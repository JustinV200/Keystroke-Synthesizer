Introduction:

In the current world, success not achieved by Cooperation,ofcourse am going to support  as people achieve more success by competition. Competition on a ground level wakes up the inner giant sleeping in all of us. It always pushes us beyond our limits and ensures we thrive for success.


Competition - the Mother of all achievements:

Competition have pushed the successes to their best and henceforth we see the records getting tumbled often. It keeps the inner fire glowing high. It always surprises the person who is willing to compete. There is no life in the results without it.

Evolution is a byproduct of Competition. For example, Newton's law of attraction was a source material for all other theories evolved during course of time. Without competition between those brilliant minds, a rocket would have been not landed in the space.

There are going to be instances where cooperation preceeds competition but still without the competition, the cooperation does not matter much. Without competition, cooperation does not gets its synchronicity.
 
Conclusion:

Competition is good, competition is better, competition always brings out the best. In every competition there is always a winner but the rest of the forum is ignited with more fire power which is the need for the moment . Competition is independent which can only breed success.
