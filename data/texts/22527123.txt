In my opinion, I believe materialism is just in our nature. It is why we want to make a lot of money so that we can buy things we could never afford. Even if we really can't afford the things we want to buy, we sometimes end up buying anyways. Why is that? I believe it is because it brings us temporary happiness. Society tells us that being materialistic is bad and that it is a waste of money but honestly, we just cannot run away from it. It is really the main reason why we earn money. To buy things we want. 

So here is the question. Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic? I honestly do not think that we should be criticized for being materialistic. If it brings us happiness and we are spending our own hard earned money, who are they to tell us that it's wrong. Even if that person is just buying endless things they want, it is their money and we really can't do much about it. Buying things makes us happy. That's just the way our brain works. Have you ever ordered something from Amazon or any other online store and you can't wait to get it? When it finally arrives, what do you do? You open the box right away because the thing you wanted is finally here. It brings us happiness. There is something in our brain that is triggered when we buy things we want and I believe we really can't turn it off. Of course we can tone it down but it will never go away.

Overall, being materialistic should not be criticized but looked into more carefully. If it truly makes the people happy, why critize them? Just let them be. This is the reason why we make money. We all want to buy a house, a nice car, nice phone, and cool things. The society may critize the people for being materialistic no matter how much they criticize, materialism will always stay with us.
