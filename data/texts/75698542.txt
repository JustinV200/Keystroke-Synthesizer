Cooperation success chosen over indivdual acknowledgement because it is a more rewarding celebration for many reasons. One important element of group achievement is the awareness of individual effort that can encourage and produce continued success as a group. Individual accolades depend heavily on one to continue to produce.

True Michael Jordan has great basketball skills. True his scoring and high flying dunking is hard to repeat. Still without Pippen passing the ball, Cartwright defending the floor, or Rodman rebounding often preventing the competition from scoring how often would Jordan have the opportunity to show his skills. Jordan became Chicago Bulls alone. And alone he shouldered the criticism of being highlighted. 

Group success is far more productive than individual trophies. The effort of many continue to flourish in an atmosphere of group support. True individual effort should be rewarded. It would not be fair to do otherwise. And this is my argument exactly. Against one another especially when sharing the same goal is counterproductive. Those with input for the successful finish should be as celebrated as the face of a win. 

Group achievement is much more rewarding than individual competition. Its wins are far reaching as opposed to the envy and hostility created by solo hurdles surpassed. More individuals putting forth efforts.
