Images and impressions seem to matter more and more each passing year.  The more marketing we consume through television, social media and other online activities, the more we become enticed and often deceived by it.  

For instance, pet food manufacturers create colorful bags with pictures of adorable animals on the front, but the food inside bears no resemblance to the food it's supposed to contain.  The advertising on the bags promotes a number of vitamins and minerals that make us believe the food is safe and even healthy.  However, not only do many dry cat foods contain several times the amount of phosphorous a cat requires, the dry nature of the food is very hard on their organs, especially their kidneys.

Another example involves our political system.  We spend so much time focusing on a candidate's appearance and the way they speak instead of focusing on the policies they support.  We need to practice individual self-discipline in order to turn away from the sensationalism and listen to WHAT the candidate truly believes and plans to do in office.

I've learned that if I'm careful to look beyond marketing and appearances to see the contents within, it actually gives me more peace and enables me to gain wisdom.  This practice not only protects me but those I love as well.
