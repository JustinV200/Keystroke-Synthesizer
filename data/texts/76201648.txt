Now a days people thinking that image and impreesion is more important to attract people.In the modern world keeping these two things will not help us to achive in our life.The world is full of wonders surrounded by many beautiful things more than human many beautiful animals,birds,etc...are living in the world.But humans only thinking about image and impreesion.

Every one in the world have some kind of image and impression.God has given everything to us but human we expect more sometimes we get by birth itself.Many does not have what they expected.So we have to live by what we have in the world.Many are showing some fake image to others they want to show they are greater than others but actullay they don't have anything but they are overthinking they having everything.Many thinking their impression is best way to attract people,with this mindset alone we cant impress people the main thing is character.Because of this image and impression people wearing some mask to them hiding their originality.They showing their other side to people there is no use of hiding our originality.

Our originality and our character is the best one so we no need to overthing about our image and impression.Just we have to show what image we have and that will show best impression of us.
