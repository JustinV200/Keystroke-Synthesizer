Throughout time, the question regarding how to achieve personal and total happiness has remained, essentially, unanswered. Perhaps, this is, in part, due to the varying views so many hold concerning this topic. Many believe that happiness comes from achieving personal goals and attaining success while others believe that happiness stems from meeting the needs of others. Mental and emotional stability promoted by actions that make one happy, including giving to others and taking care of oneself propels a happy life. Thus, it is imperative to consider others along with oneself when considering ultimate and genuine happiness. 

A delicate balance of taking care of others and one's own needs leads to a full life. Being part of society is proven to reduce symptoms of depression due to loneliness and isolation. When we put ourselves out there, we tend to make friends and gain experiences as well. Therefore, being around others creates opportunities we wouldn't have otherwise gained. Moreover, these opportunities create an abundance of potential. Setting goals for oneself contributes directly to happiness. When our dreams are met, chemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine, are released in the brain, which causes us to be happy. 

Without the compassion that comes from helping others, coupled with the opportunities gained, and the emotional intelligence that comes from understanding one's own mental, spiritual, and physical being, one cannot find happiness. In conclusion, selfishness and selflessness combined appropriately will increase one's chances of being happy. These elements are crucial to leading a happy life.
