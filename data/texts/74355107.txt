Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. In our current age, there is little to look forward to. Our government is all corrupt, police are killing people in the streets, and global warming is putting us on an extinction course. To be sure, materialism is to blame for some of that. However, that is the fault of the brands and corporations pushing unsustainable products into the market, not the fault of the consumer.
 Consumers are merely filling their role - to consume. No one can blame people for seeking what happiness and comfort there is to be found in material objects, or in so-called retail therapy. And nor should people be to blame for this. In an age where people are underpaid and overworked, and corporations are driving the planet to an untimely death, I do not believe that the common people should be held to blame for any of society's ills. 
It is the billionaire and millionaire elite, corporate executives, and greedy politicians that are and have been making the choices that are killing the planet and making life harder for the poor and middle class. Therefore those that find happiness in material things should be allowed to enjoy them as much as they want and are able.
