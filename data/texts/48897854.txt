Happiness is an emotion. It can be of anything. For some, it will come when they do their own work for their growth or dreams. And for some, happiness is helping others. The majority comes here when people seek happiness by helping others who are in need of anything. That happiness is the true thing. It doesn't have any selfishness or any kind of expectations. That is pure. 

When we help people who are in need of anything and we are in a state of helping them, we do a great thing, not only to them, but for ourselves too. It gives pleasure and abundant of happiness. That happiness is pure and it can't be replaced by any. So, if you want to feel the true hapiness, start helping others who are seeking for help. It may be a small thing for you, but for them, it worth a lot.

Doing our own works gives us pleasure, not happiness. People dont understand such things and they often get confused of this. This is not something wrong. People can realise the difference if they make a keen look at this regularly. Finally, helping others only give people happiness. So, if you want to be happy, help others.
