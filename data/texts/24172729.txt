  In this essay I will try to convince you of the benefits of cooperation and how teamwork is a much better way to succeed instead of competitive success. Competition causes rivalry which can cause toxicity in the workplace, with anger and frustration among company workers.  That's why cooperation has a clear benefit, creating a friendly teamwork-rich environment at work.
   The workplace will grow and benefit from a group of people from multiple backgrounds, each with different skillsets. As more people are working on a project, for instance, a team is much better served from a team that works together than a group that is trying to compete against another. As in that situation multiple teams working on seperate projects can collaborate instead of working to be better than the other. Collaberation and teamwork are the best choice, if you want to have the best outcomes.
  To try and benefit from rivalry and competition is a double-edged sword that leads to uncertain outcomes. One way to look at it is in a competition, there is always a loser. That can lead to failure which can have negative outcomes. With cooperation, howver, there is only an attempt by multiple people to overcome a problem, which, more often than not, leads to a great outcome. 
 In summary, I believe that the clear choice between cooperation for success and rivalry and competition towards success to be best is cooperation as the benefits far outweigh any risk from any outcome when one is attempting to succed or overcome a problem.
