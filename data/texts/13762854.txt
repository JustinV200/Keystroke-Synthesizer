Success is something everyone strives to achieve.  How we achieve success is something everyone must choose for themselves.  No two people are alike in what motivates them and this unique diversity within the human condition is what truly decides the way we engage each other on our path to success. 

The best way to achieve success is to embrace both cooperation and competition.  Competition drives us to new heights and pushes us outside our comfort zones.  However, having rivals does not mean that you have enemies.  Sometimes your rivals can be your biggest asset through the motivation they provide to achieve more and by offering unique perspectives to common problems.  When we acknowledge that our journey to success is primarily a competition with ourselves and that our fellow competitors are taking the exact same journey in parallel, it becomes much easier to help one another race toward independent goals while furthering our own achievements. 

A perfect example of this type of cooperative competition would be the transportation terminal where my husband works.  He is a truck driver that is paid by the load and he works with many other drivers that are all competing for loads of varying pay, difficulty and distance.  Many drivers try to manipulate the dispatchers with ugly gossip about their coworkers to get themselves the best loads but the drivers that are most cooperative with one another and with the needs of the terminal, before their own, are the drivers that receive the best loads. 

Creating an environment of cooperative competition may be difficult but it will reap rewards for everyone involved.  Racing toward goals together is always more productive than losing your balance trying to trip up the competition.  It only takes a couple of people to start a wave of cooperation within a group and then everyone begins working together towards greatness for all.
