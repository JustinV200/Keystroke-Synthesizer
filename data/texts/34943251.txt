The achievement is based on the cooperation and competition equally. Because of the cooperation we bulid our discipline activities and improve our skills.Then we should participate the competition definitely we achieve success.One day my friend planned to achieve 21 km half maraton. 
He start the daily practices on that day, but he should not complete the skills requirement of maraton properly. So he cooperate with seniors to gain knowledge and skills to achieve the maraton skills requirement. Then he should start the practice with senior guidance and cooperate with senior for continous practice for achievement. In between he did not attend the practice properly and don't cooperate with seniors. So he is not eligible for next skill requirement.Then one day the notification came to his ear that is only few more days to attend the  21 km half maraton. 
One day he visit the senior to asked how i prepare myself to attend the maraton. But the senior did not respond properly to him. He saw the other participant practice in the ground heavily but one small boy is very hard to practice for maraton. The boy notice that the small is younget than he. So he motivate himself to win the half maraton. THen he will start the practices regularly and heavily. On that day came he ready to run on the maraton with other participant.Till last he did not lose the confidence and win the competition.The cooperation and competition is very important for our success. The success is based on both.
