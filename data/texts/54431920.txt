   How do you define true happiness? That a hard one because to someone such as myself, I find my happiness in helping others. If I am able to do even the slightest task for someone and it makes their life easier or it brings them any sense of peace or happiness, that is what brings me joy. I love to see the smiles on my loved ones faces and knowing that I put it there, or that I played a role in putting it there, it makes my heart sing. One peiece of advice, don't get so wrapped up in fixing others or helping someone else that you neglect yourself. 
   Now, on the other hand, you have people who must make themselves happy first before they can be of use to anyone else. These poeple have to have found their own joy and self worth first before they can pour into anyone else's. It's kind of like how can I help anyone else if I can't help myself? Or how can I fix someone else if I am already broken?
   There truly isn't anything wrong with either of these two kinds of people. To be quite honest they both have their own pro's and con's.  We honestly need both types of people in this world to bring balance. Personally, I beleive whatever makes you sleep better at night is what you should strive for. Finding a the position that suits you and go for it. Myself, I am learning to be a balance of the two people and that seems to be working just fine.
