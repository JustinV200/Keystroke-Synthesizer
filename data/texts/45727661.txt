We all come to work for one reason - to contribute to goals sucessfully in order to recieve compensation. Success of a goal is often measured on whether or not a goal is reached and how efficiently it has reached that. Engaging in competition to achieve success can reduce the amount of positive outcomes versus effort put in at reaching the common goal, leading to inefficiencies. People achieve more success when cooperation is prioritized, communication is effective, and all efforts are focused on building on each others' efforts towards the common goal. 

Competition is, by definition, separate efforts towards one goal. Competition does allow for different opportunities and methods to be executed to completion. This can, at times, lead to new efficiencies within an individual's process. Competition means that one person will come out on top. However, competition also means that one or more other persons' efforts will not be recognized and it also doesn't guarantee that the top competitor has reached the most desirable outcome with the least costs. This means that with competition, there could be more costs than benefits and therefore less success. If multiple people want the same goal, this is an inefficient use of energy. 

When a group is able to work together and communicate effectively while doing it, there is opportunities for checks and balances and can cut off less desirable outcomes from happening sooner. While competition can lead to one individual finding success, it reduces efficiencies of the group and wastes other's time. Working together in cooperation therefore can lead to better outcomes with less cost and overall efficient efforts in reaching the goal. This means cooperation leads to more success and as a bonus, everyone can feel that achievement.
