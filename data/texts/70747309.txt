Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic, it is not our fault because it is how we are programmed.  Since the beginning of man on earth, it has always been about the gathering and keeping of stuff. Whoever had the most was the one respected and often the leader, since he could help others to find things to support their lives. 

 We have to work to buy things to survive, such as food, shelter, clothing, and transportation. So soon it becomes a need for a reward.  I have been working hard, I deserve to have something a little better.  I want the deluxe pizza, not the plain cheese.  I want the name brand jeans, not the store brand. I want the nicer  car, not the one that is always needing to be repaired. How can it be wrong to want the better things? 

  However, the problem starts when buying just to be buying, or accumulating things just to have them. As I have aged and seen what is left when someone passes away, maybe the connection to material things is a problem.  What do you do with all their collections when they are gone, and no one wants them?  Perhaps the minimalists have a better grasp on things. The less we have, the less we impact the environment.

  So while having the better stuff may make life easier, perhaps making memories is more important than buying materials that need to be disposed of in the end. Is materialism bad? Perhaps when taken to the extremes that we have seen, but the idea of wanting better stuff for a better life is not a bad thing.

I did not need the full 30 minutes to present my argument. Sorry. I am a consisce thinker and do not like to waste time or words that will not be read.
