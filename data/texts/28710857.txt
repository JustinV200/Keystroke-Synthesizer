   Yes I do believe that images and impressions do have an effect on people. The simple fact that how you are dressed, how you look and act you are judged by. You can be the nicest trustworthy person but if you have tattoos and piercings all over your body somebody else will look at you like a criminal or a bad person. If you are a loud talker people will portray you as a ghetto crazy person. As I do feel like judging someone on their image or impressions and actually not getting to know them is wrong but this is the world we live in. 
  Some people will create a picture of you because of your race as well. Just because you don't look the same as people would like you too they will talk about you. I feel like you shouldn't worry about what image or impressions you are showing. If you are being yourself and people can't accept that their judgement shouldn't matter. 
  You should be able to show people the real you. Even though most of the time we do want to impress someone first time meeting them, we should accept that everyone won't see us how we would like them to. As humans sometimes we are influenced by public figures and we think that we have to fit in and dress how they dress or act how they act. My only suggestion is live your life how you want to and  don't change who you are trying to impress the next person!
