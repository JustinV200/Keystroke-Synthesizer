Yes, images and appearances have too much impact on people nowadays. Media and all the other social outlets have made life nowadays more glamorous than it should be. People are obsessed about their looks more than morel or charater which is really sad. 
The so called influencers and media personalities are creating a false narrative of getting a person's self worth is by how they appear or how much a person is willing to spend on their look. It is all and well upto a certain point when young and impressionable people watch this and feel like thire self worth is compeletly based on the look and money a lot of people get hurt by this narrative.
People spend hours on end following these celbrities and influencers on all plaforms If these famous people are will they can change a lot of social issues and bring peace overall but they use their influence to sell useless product and create more hate into peoples heart. Famous people have a great power in their hand so we should hope that these people will put it to good use and make all the young and impressionable peoples life better and make the world a better place for the next generation.
