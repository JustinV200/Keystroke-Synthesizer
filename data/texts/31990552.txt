What do you think is more important to acheive success between cooperation or  competition? In my opinion, I think that while competition is a good way to gain success, the best way is through cooperation. In many ways, competition is very good as long as it is healthy, and not to get back at someone. If you watch sports, then you know that it takes more then just one person to make the team win, no matter how good they are at the sport. So, In the same way as in a job, or in a sport you will acheive more success by using cooperation.

You will achieve more success by using cooperation, because it takes more then just one person to do a job, or play in a sport. Also, it helps that you can use the other persons ideas, and they could also use yours. It is way easier to use cooperation because you can get things done faster, so you can achieve success faster.

In my opinion, I think you can acheive more success by using cooperation, for example, you can be a chef at a restruant and cook the food but the other people who work there would help prepare the food, serve the food because you can only do a job at a time. I also understand that competition is a very good thing and can be helpful, but competition can only get you so far and without working with someone or someone giving you ideas for stuff you can only get so far in a job.
