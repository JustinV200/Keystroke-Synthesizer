     Happiness occurs when people behave according to their true self. When we try to be something other than our true self, then we are unhappy and probably making others unhappy as well. The Bible has a passage about removing the log from our own eye before we remove the splinter from the eye of another person. The airplane rule in a dangerous situation is to put the oxygen mask on ourselves before we assist the person next to us. These rules tell us we must take care of ourselves before assisting others.
     
     In social situations such as being in a family or a neighborhood or church group, there is a mandate  to help others. We must use this situations to provide to others, something we own. This is called sharing and we must share our time, money, emotions and other resources to help others with their needs and problems. This does not mean that our own problems are not important and our own needs are not going to be taken care of.  The boat can hold only so many passengers or else it will sink.

     In helping others, we help ourselves by looking at life through different perspectives. When we see the world differently we gain more information that helps us work towards our personal goals. We might lose some time, money or energy but we gain by rechecking our personal goals. This keeps us on the road toward their fulfillment. It is not being selfish to direct our attention away from others back to ourselves.  Finding our true self is the road we must travel. It may be lonely at times and it may be bumpy but it is our road and every person must travel on their own road.
