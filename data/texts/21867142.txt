Do you thrive more in a competitive environment or do you thrive more in a more cooperative environment? How successful are you in each of these environments? Each and every person is different, we all know this. Some are very competitive and others are very cooperative. Many of us may even be a good combination of cooperative and competitive. I think that I am a bit of both. I am very cooperative, yet, I can be very competitive. I think it depends on the enviroment that I am in and perhaps, even what it at stake. As far as which one I think that I am more successful in? I think that I am more successful in a cooperative environment. I feel that there's less stress and pressure in a cooperative environment. 

Some of us don't deal well under pressures or stressers. I am one of those people! I can often find myself looking for a way out of the situation, instead of completing the task at hand. That doesn't do anything good for anyone.  Some jobs/careers can call for more cooperativeness or for more competitiveness. So, if you are more like one than the other, you may need to first decide which one would be a better fit for the job you are in or for a future career change. 

Cooperation can lead to further career opportunities and advancements, while competitiveness could lead to there being less career opportunities and advancements. Being in a workplace with others and having clashing personality traits can be destructive. Learning to cope with different personalities can lead to personal growth and advancement. Accomplishments can mean something different to each and every one of us. It's how we feel about these accomplishments that should mean the most to us. Do they make you feel complete, satisfied, and content? If so, great! If not, then reevaluate your needs and wants.
