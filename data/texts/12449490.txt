In todays world most people expect victories in a very short period. I think it should be achieved by two ways either by competition or by cooperation. People choose competition instead of cooperation. They can prove themselves by means of rivalry at work and they are focusing in innovative ideas and also focus on avoid failures. They are money minded persons and act like robots. But the real human being choose cooperation instead of competition.
  The people who are engaged in their competition, but lack in cooperation. They didn't concern on significant and lasting accomplishments. But cooperation is a splendid one for better performance than competition. It creates unity among people in their work and build prosperity environment. sometimes competition looks so clumsy and its create crisis on some environment. It is not suitable for all environment.
 In my opinion, cooperation is better than competition. I can achieve more success by choosing cooperation. unity is very important in work. It is essential for team work. cooperation paves the way to achieve success. It takes long time but it's a stability one. so every people should concern on this method. competition has been vandalise the performance of cooperation. But cooperation is stay stronger and provides better results for their career. It helps in difficult times.
