Think of a time when you were asked to cooperate with someone. It could have been when you were young and had to cooperate with classmates to make a popsicle house. It could have been in college when you were asked to cooperate with group members to do a group study. Or, it could have been recently at work where you were asked to cooperate with your co-workers to get a project done. While competiton and rivlary can help people achieve goals, it is cooperation that ultimately produces significant and lasting accomplishments.

When we cooperate with someone, we are working together for a common goal. This can help us remove ego that can sometimes prove to be an obstacle in our work. Additionally, working with someone can help provide ideas that we hadn't thought of. Because of this, when we cooperate and work together we can overcome obstacles more easily. Cooperating with someone can also help keep us keep focused on the goal, as we have more than just our own needs to look after. For instance, if we do not have someone we are being accountable for, it can be easy to get distracted and do something else as in that scenario we are only hurting ourselves. 

With competition, we can also see results and accomplishments. However, these are not as likely to be as lasting or significant as those from cooperation. When the reward is good, it can be easier to justify cutting corners to get to the end goal quicker. That can lead to work that is not as satisfactory as when we were cooperating and working with someone else. With rivalry, we can sometimes become too focused on beating someone that we overlook ways to make our work it's best. 

Whether you are working with a class mate on a projuct or with a co-worker on a work assignment, cooperation is key for success. It can be beneficial for getting to the end goal more quickly and in ways you hadn't thought of before. It can also help product signficant and lasting accomplishments
