This is a hard topic, because not everybody can fit under one umbrella. For instance, some people find great happiness in the servitude of others, while others find happiness expanding and working towards their personal goals. Happiness cannot be defined so easily; sometimes the smallest reason can bring a burst of happiness.

I think happiness is intertwined in all of our experiences. A person might decide to donate their time to a charity, thinking that helping others will help them find happiness. And it will! You can walk away from that experience euphoric, knowing you volunteered your time and effort to make things better for another person. That's amazing! However, this also checks off a personal goal - if you volunteered your time, this was a personal goal for your growth and development as a human.

Alternatively, if you decide to focus on yourself - your own personal goals, and no one else's - I think you will find that these experiences are still entwined, albeit harder to see. For instance, your own personal happiness can spark happiness in others - just by showing excitement, or personal happiness. Close friends and family will also be overjoyed by your gains - proving that all happiness is intertwined. We should all go out in the world seeking our own personal happiness - and sparking joy for others, while we're at it.
