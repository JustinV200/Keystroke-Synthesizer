We all are consumer one way or another in this world unless you solely live in a communism society, so I am sure that everyone know about materialism.  

There had been different views over materialism.  Some think that it is bad which make people more focused on material items and forgetting about humanity.  However, we all live in a capitalism society and materalism is not always a bad idea.  People could be motivated to work harder in order to get what they wants which in turn increase in productivity and development of society.  Just think about how many things of this world may not be created if we do not have the desires.  We may not have refridgerator, TV or other type of technology.  The desire to own something helps in society development.  

Of course if we solely focus on material items it is not good either.  We may forget about what other people's need and could become indifferent with people's feeling.  Afterall we are social animal, we do need each other existence to support society development.  Think about if you do not have the farmers to grow your food or workers in the factory to make the things you want.  We could not solely live on our own.  

So, as long as we are not totally indulge ourselves material items then it could be good for the whole society.  We all have some desires and wants in life.  We just need to know and understand what is important in life, materialism is not the devil.
