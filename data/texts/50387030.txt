Competition is the force or activity that strives prople to gain or win something they want very much in their life. On the other hand cooperation means works together to achieve the same end. Helping, work with, hands to hands, being with someone to help, helps to achieve someone to reach their goals can be considered as a cooperation. 

In my philosophy, cooperation is much better than competition. Competition is just a running or doing something without any relationship. It is just for themself and nothing for anyone. It is a process of left someone and go fast.

Besides cooperation is the process of doing something together through this it creates relationship with people. If you live in a society you have to cooperate in many times with the society. 
Also we can say that when a person involving in competition maybe he or she will fail but when someone working in a group being cooperation, it is very sure that he or she will success. 
Being susscessful cooperation is much better way than competition. The success rate of cooperation is very high than competition.  

At the end we can say that, competition makes pe0ple angry and aggressive. But cooperation makes people friendly and accessible. 
So, for achieving more and more success people should work together with cooperation.
