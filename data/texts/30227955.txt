Materialism is absolutely huge in today's society. Everyone you know is obsessed with materials: owning the newest popular thing, buying constantly, seeing advertisements for "things YOU NEED!" everywhere, and so much more. But is this hurting our society? Is this harmful for children to grow up in an environment so obsessed with materials? I think it just might be.

It's impossible not to see advertisements literally everywhere you go. In person, you get store catalogues mailed to you, you see billboards on the side of the freeway while driving to work, and you walk past stores with giant pictures of models wearing the latest fashion. Online, almost every single website on the internet has paid advertisements via pop ups or large pictures in the corner of the screen. We are constantly being bombarded with the idea that we need new things all the time! This makes it super hard for parents to teach our kids to be grateful for what they have and to not need to always be buying everything they see. Materialism is harming our family values!

Yes, there are gonna be some times where we do need some new things, like when our clothes have rips in them, we start a new job with a different dress code, holiday gifts, or our car breaks down. But do we need to constantly be attacked by big corporations telling us we need expensive new jewelry when we are just trying to google something for work? Do we need our children thinking if they don't have all the latest popular toys that they won't be having as much fun as other kids? Definitely not, society is getting hurt by materialism, which is fueled by corporations wanting to take our (the consumer's) money just for their gain.
