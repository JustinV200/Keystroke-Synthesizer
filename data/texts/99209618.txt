Happiness is subjective. Some people think happiness has to do with success, others think it's how much they've left their impact on the world. There's not a specific or definitive answer for each person, it's an opinion... A feeling for each individual person to decide for themselves. There may always be a debate on how people can obtain this disposition.

Success in life typically leads to happiness, but then what is success? Is it money? Influence? Is it overtaken when life brings hardships? It truly varies from person to person, but what happiness has in common overall is when a person feels fulfillment and positivity. Finding something you're great at and persuing it is a great way to fill that longing. Overcoming a negative event in your life can contribute to finding happiness. Being with a person to share your love, fears, and thoughts with is so important across the board to feel the pleasures of life. 

Most people have different goals. Some will feel happiness by focusing on their own goals and aspirations, such as getting promoted at work, owning a successful business, making a certain amount of money, owning a lot of material items, etc. Others feel happiness by giving to others, creating a selfless life. Giving their time, money, and services to benefit others will be a huge factor in determining their joy in life. Doing for others is what drives the emptiness away and brings feelings of contentment and fulfillment. 

There really is no true definition for happiness, other than a blanket statement of feeling joy, contentment, completeness. Every person capable of feelings will have a different opinion, a different goal, a different view. To try to explain happiness to someone who has never felt it would be nearly impossible, as it's so different for each individual. Just like beauty, happiness is truly in the eye of the beholder, and when you feel it, it changes your world.
