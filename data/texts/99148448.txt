     Materialism is valuing things over experiences and people. Modern society should be criticized for it's materialistic drive. The goal of most people in today's modern world is to acquire the things that are seen as needed, and then keep acquiring the things we want to have. The spiritual and holistic well being of the people working is ignored, and we lose a connection with each other. This is not the best way for a society to work, and it is just not sustainable for us as a race or our planet.
     Our planet is being polluted with non-renewable materials such as plastic at an unprecedented rate. If people keep using these materials the waterways, the animals, and even the air we breath will not be clean enough to keep us alive and well. 
   Building sprawling neighborhoods with new homes and pools takes a huge toll on the environment. The habitats of animals and plants that are vital to balanced ecosystems are destroyed, leaving behind a perfect recipe for natural disasters, as the earth can't heal itself any longer. 
     Just like we scar our planet, we scar our families and friends with materialistic lifestyles. We value looking at our phones over talking with our friends or watching a viral video over taking our kids to the park. We lose connection with people when we value technology over human connections. 
     Balance in life is necessary and usually hard to achieve. Materialism has it's place in a modern society , but should be frowned upon, not idolized. We should set a goal to have achieved emotional stability over home ownership and friendships over followers. Being materialistic in a modern society doesn't have to be the norm, and we can do better for the future.

This only took 11 minutes. The submit button should really show up once I reach the word count. I hope this doesn't affect my bonus, but it's been saying I'm "inactive". I also left the page, but it was to go over the instructions that I copy/pasted in another tab.
