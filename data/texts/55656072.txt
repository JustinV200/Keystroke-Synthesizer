According to me, the people needs to be a good competitor as well as not much cooperator, so then only they can attain their goal as possible they can. Among many people, they are considering them only as competitor in any way to achieve their goal. But it is not a correct  way to sustain their in their life track.

A good competitor in the since they need not to tolerate all the co-competitor for their success. They also need to give their full effort to attain their success. They can also help other co-competitor to come along with them.

But being cooperation is also important in this modern society. By giving their best knowledge and ideas to achive goals as a team.  Mainly it is working in team work such as office project and also social activities. It will helps the team to avoid failures for all the people who are in the team. But all teamates who are in the team should put their equal amount of effort to avoid failures from the important success.

And also encouraging is one of the most common factor for both the good competitor and as well as the team cooperation to avoid their important failures or to achive success.
