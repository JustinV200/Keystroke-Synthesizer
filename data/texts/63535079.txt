Happiness can come from a variety of places.  One such place is from personal goals.  When a person truely focuses on their own personal dreams and goals, generally those dreams are rrealized and they come true, people are happy.  

I believe that if you set you mind to your own goals, and truely focus on them, the university will help you achieve them.  Achieving those goals gives people a sense of accomplishment, and that leads to happiness.  Goals can be for all different things, and often goals are things that we want, and getting these things provides happiness.   All people need dreams,  we need something to live for, and something to strive for.  A world without hopes and dreams, isn't much of a world, and not one that I would want to live in. 

Another way of achieving happiness is focusing on the happiness of others, and yes, while that does bring people happiness, i do not belive that happieness is greater than the happiness achieved when reaching ones own personal goals.  However - they can be combined.  Maybe your personal goal is to make other happy, and to focus on their happiness - then you win all around!  

In conclusion, there are multiple ways to reaching happiness, weather it be through focusoing on your own personal goals, or focusing on the happiness of others,  which ever way you choose to live your life - you'll be happy, and happiness is what matters!
