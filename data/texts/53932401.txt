1. Pursuing your own happiness directly benefits yourself and you need to put yourself first.
2. Making yourself happy will spread to others around you.

Pursuing your own goals in life will be the most self-fullfuling achievenment you can have in life. If you work hard and complete this goal, other people will be happy for you. If you find that these people arent happy for you, then they do not need to be in your life. The happiness of others will not benefit you if those people dont return the favor for you.

Pursuing your own goals allows you to spread the positiveity to people that you care about. This can be pure happiness or benefit your financial situation. If you are achieving your own goals, you are also probably getting some financial gain from this. Extra income allows you to not only help yourself but to help others.
