     Cooperration adds to the result, competition subtracts from it. It seems to me that when team members cooperate, every effort counts toward the final product. The ideas and the effort of  each member are never wasted, no matter how small it may be. Also, there is the human factor where motivation comes in; once a member is promoted to come up with ideas by accepting, or at least listening to, their ideas, this becomes a contagious habit, and automatically generate more ideas. After all, isn't being appreciated for our efforts the ultimate source of drive?
      On the conterary, isn't competition based on eliminating others? It's rooted in eliminating what others have to offer. Instead of utilizing other ideas, it seems to shut them down. Shutting down a creative mind is the last thing to do in a team setting, unless you want no creativity but obedience, which doesn't get anything novel done.
      Also on a more psychological sense, cooperation multiplies, while competition divides. It's the motivational factor that makes things learning habits and turns them into sustainable methods for teams. If every member is constantly competing within itself, it divides the team into pieces everytime there is work to be done. However, cooperation motivates each member by promoting them to create more and more, an therefore multiplying the effort in the long run.
