For years companies have sought to generate attractive marketing to the customer, from their television commercials to advertising and packaging that the customer considers eye-catching. Many of these products call to a product's supposed "quality" only by its packaging, although this is no t a reality. After all, many companies that produce quality products take great care in the presentation of a product to demostrate the quality and commitment thath this has towards the ultimate goal of the customer. 

Many people buy the product based on the company's reputation, without considering the packaging, because they know the type and quality of the product they expect to get. The company indeed allocates large sums of money to manufacture an attractive advertisement. Still, if it does not maintain the quality of the product, it will gradually decline and be a great failure for the company. 

In a wider world such as the artistic, we will always be fooled a little by the image of an artist or singer, in a couple of weeks, we are stereotyped by what I would call "the sensation of the moment" these artist tent to disappear after a great boom because, in the end, talent is everithing.
