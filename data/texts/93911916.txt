     I think a person is more likely to find happiness if they focus on their peronal goals rather than focusing only on the happiness of others. Of course people have different personalities and life circumstances that would play into the outcome of one's happiness. The mentality of a person, what their goals are and what the end result of said goals would be could also factor into the outcome.
     I do believe one should worry about the happiness of others, I just don't believe they could find happiness by only worrying about the happiness of others.That can prove to be an endless task where people can sometimes take advantage and instead steal your happiness because they see you are so willing to do whatever it takes to make them happy. If you have personal goals that include bringing happiness to others or goals that provide improvements for humanity or solutions to issues in the world then I believe those goals would provide happiness for one's self and for others. 
     Overall happiness is more likely achived by living in a manner you can feel good about. You can imagine a life you can be proud of or picture what you'd be doing when you think of happiness and set a personal goal to make that happen. Even if your goal is to make others happy in some way. Surrounding yourself with people with a common goal can create happiness for everyone involved. The more happiness achived by people the more people that will become happy and it spreads throughout. However people achive happiness I'd rather it spread world wide than something else!
