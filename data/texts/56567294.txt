a good relationship is presious to all but we people are now obsesed with objects and things that is just mere things they do not become a part of us but real friends and family becomes a part of us, now a days we are mostly criticized by the materials that we posses we are not valued by our thoughts and respect instead all these are valued by the amount of money we have and the materials we possess.

we actually waste more money on things that is not useful or valuable just we buy them for some useless popularity though a lot of people talk about other being materialistic they themselves are also materialistic everyone here is blameful and we must value things that actually value insted of being materialistic modern life is actally much more demanding in nature we use a lot of devices and modern technology to make our life easy these all must be kept under control with serious measures taken.

people must learn to respect the valus of others like people and enjoyment ratherthan being much more materailistic we have to accept the fact that we are quite materialistic and we must agree to change for the good of our future generation.
