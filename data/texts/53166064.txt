In the social media realm, images and impressions are a big deal! It's a numbers game of likes, views, following. All seems to alter the view and perspective of a person's reality. I will not go far and will use myself as an example. I spend hours online watching various organization content, aesthetically spotless homes, travel reelz and what have you. I end up feeling miserable. What a boring life I have. How unorganized I can be. How I can't afford nice things - are crippling thoughts that eat up my reality once I step in that realm.

Don't get me wrong - I have a job. I am pretty organized. I can afford travel. But the insane amount of content is too much even for a competent person like me. The distortion of reality is so unreal that even my nine year old daughter knows the concept of aesthetic. It's being fed to us to consume our system that you can find your worth and value through numbers of likes, followers and views. 

We are at the mercy of people who judge us by how we are perceive. If we are worthy of that image or that impression. It's the sad reality we are in right now.
