yes, images and impressions have too much of an affect on people. Bwcause, if we heard about something (or) some one (or) read about somthing, we can remember it for a while. But, if we see it in image ut will store in our mind quickly if the image is presented in a colourful manner, it will not erase from our and also it creates good impression.
 more than adults, children also gets more attraction tauards images and impression. if we teach them orathy, they cannot understand. butif we teach them with colourful images, it will easily stored in their brain and they also like this way of learing new things. this make good impression on images.
the reason for the success media and advertisements are they are promating  things in a colourful way to gain good impression from the people and presenting it in a clear image, so the people can understand about it very well. so, according to my view images and impressions makes good effect on people. The images maked people understants things quickly and also helps them to remember it frequently and makes a good impression an it this way of explaining by images and impression have only good effest on people.
This is the best effective one for the people.
