      Some people may achieve through cooperation,some people may achieve through competition.
but in my view i see many people will achieve success by competition only. there should be competition in everything.so that only we take things serious,also competition should be in a healthy way.
      When we cooperate with people we lost out uniqueness and talent. if we prefer competition we got extra energy and we win them easily.In team matches we should be cooperate within our team to win the other team by competition,some place both will be happend.it is depend on the situation only.
       If we succeed by competition it builts our personality,individuality,talent etc.if we succeed through cooperation we lost everything because there will others decision only in high. whatever the suituation we should be involve fully by our own ideas or plans.so that only that specific success is fully came by ourself.healthy competition always need to this highfy technology world.everybody is running to get succeed.we are also running only to reach that succeeded place,we run towards by competition it may surely give fine result one day.life is all about number one. our thinking and thoughts will definetely give good result when it will be in healthy fight. so according to me people get more success by competition only.
