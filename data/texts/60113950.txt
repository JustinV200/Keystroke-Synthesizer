Personal happiness is a very important aspect of one's personal and social life. What makes one person happy, could be very different from what makes someone else happy.


Doing things for oneself can bring joy; for example, buying something that you wanted could bring joy to yourself. Similarly, visiting somewhere you wanted to could lead to a lot of excitement as well. 

On the other hand, you could buy something for someone else, as a gift - which could bring joy to that person. Like the other previous example, you could also go for a trip with other people, and maybe babpay for this trip for everyone. If this is a trip that makes the other person special that could bring a lot of joy to that person.

There could also be things one does for the greater good of many people. For example, a philanthropist could help build a school  or develop a playground for a deserving neighborhood, and that could benefit a large community or area. 

In summary, there could be multiple ways to get to your personal needs of happiness. If could be doing something for yourself, doing something for others, or maybe a combination of all of these for the greater good of the community!
