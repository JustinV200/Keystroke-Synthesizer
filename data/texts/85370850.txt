                                     "Materialism is the thing that everybody loves to hate."
                                                                   

                                                                         I think materialism will be a major part in life to run a family. It also helps youngster to acquire a basic knowledge of "How to run their life in society". It is a line betweeen personal interest and morality. In American history materialism plays a importatnt role from 18th century to the modern era.

                                                                          Buying a basic needs is normal. Instead of buying some basic needs in life somebody buy a brand expensive cars, house,etc. It states that they are somewhat expensive. Being immortal based on material they have. Many of heathness, shows that they have a financial status  in their town. This explains me that the modern society critized for being materialistic states they don't care about what they are living in the time period. One who help others to get support either by financial or word of mouth it will definitely make their dreams to come true.

                                                                           It clearly states help others when they do things .
That helps many youngster to acheive their goal in life. Being a part of society we should know one thing "Never ever critize anyone based on financial status!!!". Each and every person should educate their childern or near by person about the materialistic, so that they can never face criticisim for being materialistic.
