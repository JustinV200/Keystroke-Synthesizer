While some people focus on making other people happy, I do not believe that they are as happy as when they are accomplishing their goals. Being able to accomplish your goals allows you more success and more abilities in life.

I believe that you cannot truly be happy unless your life is going well. When I have focused souly on other people, I have neglected certain aspects of my life. I believe that self success is a big indicator for happiness, if you are not accomplishing anything, you are not your best self. I think that you are always going to be searching and seeking for happiness. For me, when I am accomplishing goals I have a feeling of self worth, self love and I am truly happy with myself. When I focus on other people, I might be helping them but its at a cost of myself.

I grew up and I learned some wise advice from my adoptive parents, you cannot focus or make other people happy until you are truly happy yourself and accomplishing goals. I believe that this still stands to this day and to be able to actually help other people to be happy, you truly have to be happy yourself and continuing to grow with goals. To be content with yourself allows an innerpeace and you can still help others but you really need to make sure your own life is going well. It is not fair to you or your happiness to focus on other people before you, and it is not healthy.
