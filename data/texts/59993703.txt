I think that it should be a combination of both cooperation and competition. 

Cooperation means that as a group or solely you become more successful as everyone else does or you do. Cooperating shows that you are not selfish nor are you an individualist. We all need help from time to time. Cooperation is the key to a civilized society and there would be anarchy without it. Cooperation buils a sharing and caring persona.

Competition is healthy at builing ones self-esteem. Competition has to be in the right context or it can become a burden or overshadow an individuals abilty to understand the reason for competition itself. Intense rivalries are not healthy, mentally nor physically and can lead to bodily injuries and required physical reahab as well as mental counseling.

Cooperation and competition should go hand in hand and fit like a glove. They are both in in the same if you really think about it. Can you truly have competition without cooperation and vis-versa. I would argue not. As in all character builing characteristics a well-balanced approach is the appropriate means.  All things must be in moderation. To much or to less of either cooperation or competition can lead to an abuse of the other one!

In summarizing I think they are both me amigos!! I think it is very healthy to have both in the proper moderation. Failure or victory should not be the finalizing factor to judge ones self.
