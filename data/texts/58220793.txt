Modern society is based in posessions. What we have and what we do not have. Our materialistic world doesn't matter what kind of a person your are. What matters is what you have and what you are willing to get. Materialism can be a slippery slope and therefore there are many other lifestyles one should consider to be a happier and better member of a new, thriving society.

Materialism can show many forms such as physical objects, people, assets, or even going so far as to hoarding our material assets, which in turn affect sour health and well being. Status is a big indicator of how materialistic our society has become. The more money or assests you have, the higher up in the chain you become. Look at celebrities; even though some celebrities may not have many physical possessions therir materialistic tendencies come in the form of their money. Status can makle people change in greedy, demanding, or even rude people. People who used to be kind and caring can change quickly when given too many things.

As humans, we need very little to survive. there is a hierarchy of needs that must be met in order to ensure a humans survival; Maslow's hierarchy of needs. They are physiological needs like air and water, safety needs like personal security or employment, love and a sense of community, respect and self esteem, and finally self actualization. No-where on the hiearchy of needs does it mention material possessions, because they are not necessary for survial. It takes a lot to change a society's views but it can start with one person. Take the path of a minimalistic life and you will find that you are much closer to self-actualization than you once thought.
