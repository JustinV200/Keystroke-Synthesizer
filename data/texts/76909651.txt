Introduction:
                     I think the most important issue, youngsters having today is the confusion on what is goal and happiness. Some thinks that achieving their goal is the most happiest moment. And some people believes that being happy is their primary goal. Now we can try to identify the problem and solution in this essay.

Position:
                 In my view, money is the ultimate power in this day. So to be happy we should have enough money atleast to run our everyday life or like surviving. Some people thinks that for that money sacrificing their own goal is not that much big matter. Normally I also think like that. 

Reasons and evidence:
                Some people had their ambition from their childhood. They were lived with those ambitions. They can't neglect them for any reason. I can relate to it. If we have enough money we will worry about our ambition. That means if we have enough money we will automatically expect anything realted to our goal. This is nature.

Counterarguments:
               We may say money is the only option to lead our life. But in certain point of life definitely get bored by that life. To make us happy, we should go for our goals.

Conclusion:
               So in my view, people should have money to run a smooth life and also they should go for their goal to achieve new things. People should get ready for both of them.
