People's expenditure to buy things they need or don't need are not equal in annway. Today, it is not worth the same for a family to buy food to feed their children, and for the same family to buy a very big screen Tv. In this respect, materialism should be criticised. 


Today, people live in the illusion of great perception, but there are very few people who aware of this. Not every gadget, every electronic, not every dress shown to us on TV or in Youtube ad is a must-buy. However, the person who comes out with such an objection immediately receives an objection that "you should gon and live in your cave, dude".  So, it is wrong to act as if every new iPhone is a necessity for almost everyone. The fact that  something is wrong doesn't depend on how many people believe it. Wrong is wrong !!!. Man can distinguish right and wrong by using his mind. 

In this respect, the perception that you are as happy as you consume, imposed on us by materialism, is just an illusion. It is also proven by many statistics/data that this is not the true. Consumption does not bring happiness. 

On the contrary, people who consme more are also more unhappy. Today, the wellfare-countries are also the countries with the highest suicide rates. The opposite of this idea is  not to buy anything, not to consume anything. People should get what they need. They should not waste their precious lives to buy things that are not needed. A cell-phone, even a smart phone, is a necessity today. This is absolutely true. But that it should be the latest model is just a deception of materialism.
