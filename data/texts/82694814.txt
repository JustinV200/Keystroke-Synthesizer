Many things and people are not what they portray in appearance.  Many times this is by design rather than misjudgement.  People usually have an intent when presenting themselves, others and or products and scenarios. 
When designing the appearance we often use our own perception of what others may expect or desire in the person or product.  In commercial situations perceptions are usually based on research to determine what the expected consumer prefers. To achieve the desired effect, the appearance may be altered to conform to the expected or desired preference.  The targeted audience of the scenario, person or object is counted on to be overwhelmed by the appearance so as not to delve into a critical assesment of the projected appearance.
This approach is not always effective, especially since it is widely known that appearances, especially commercial appearances and scenarios are taken for granted as an exageration for financial gain. Personal appearances and scenarions may be less taken for granted if the target suspects that there is motive for deception. 
All in all, what we see usually overwhelms us more often than not. Most of us do not take the time to be critical of the many appearances that we are subjected to daily.
