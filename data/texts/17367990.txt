"Wow! She's so beautiful! I wish I could look like that!" This is a statement all too often spoken, or even thought, by young people who are in the prime of their lives. They should be focusing on what great purpose they were created for, but rather they are trapped in a world of comparison. The false images portrayed by media and its influencers not only have too much of an effect on people but are actually damaging the future generation.

The pervasiveness of photoshopping, filters, and the ability of social media to show only one's best self are actively doing harm to an easily influenced generation who will be the future of our nation. Rather than focusing on their own internal abilities and skills, people are too fixated on presenting a pretty outside package. The result is adoring fans and sponsorships (only if you are successful!) but the lack is any actual, meaningful influence and interaction. Our youth need role models and mentors, not pretty packaging that looks good on the outside but has no substance within. 

In his analysis for CNN, John Duffy talks about "self-esteem" addiction and describes teenagers spending an hour editing their photos for maximum "likes" on instagram. This fixation on appearance can be nothing less than damaging. In the same analysis, the benefits of social support within social media are highlighted, however the focus on surface, rather than substance, far outweighs these advantages. 

Images and impressions are having too much impact on emotional well-being. We need to get down to causes and conditions and bring our focus back to what really matters - who we are on the inside.
