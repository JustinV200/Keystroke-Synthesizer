Firstly, I believe that all of us agreed upon one thing that money has become the strongest apparent power on this earth. All the people are trying as much as they can to provide themselves and their dependents with the life needs, which mainly requires many sources of money earnings. Despite that, For me when it comes to deal with any individual whose interest and speech is always for and about money, I always got a bad expression on him and directly judge that he is materialistic. Money is important and is required to ease our lives but not to control our behaviours and attitudes. For example, we still need to buy  stuff, pay a rent,etc. So, money is always a need.

Thinking of modern societies to be crticized for being matrialistics makes me little bit confused.  I cannot judge on the society as awhole, because we need as human beings to omprove ourselves and our  lives in someway.  Spending energy in producing or consuming products is not frustrating. It can be expressed as a tool of improvement and upgrading life level. On the other hand, I believe when our focus was on collecting money and materialism, we lost the soul of life. People are always busy collecting money from one or more jobs which diminished the social relationships remarkably. I can not deny that when I and my husband decided to work side by side to improve our financial staus, were unable to have the least required level for a quality life. For instance, we barely attended family gatherings and occasions in our working days. Moreover, we were exhausted to find time for our little one Maryam and spending such a quality time.

Conclusively, that was agood point to disscus. materialism is not an option in some situations but I belive that we still need to improve our souls, personalities and look for other sources of happiness than money.
