I do not beleive that modern society be criticized for being materialistic. The reason for this is because if you earned it why not spend it on the things you enjoy the most. There is nothing wrong with likeing the finer things in life. The older genaration is on a concept of working hard and holding on to finical status and dies to leave their wealth to they grand childern. we shoud not have the audasty to judge how someone spends they own money. 
                  There are some things that can be differnt on the way people act with they personl attatuide some people start to let the meterialistic thing change their personalites
