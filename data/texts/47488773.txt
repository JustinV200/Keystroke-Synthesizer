The importance of appearance on people nowadays and how it affects our behavior.

Image and appearance are pervasive in our society and they are redefining how we perceive the world around us. The disconnect between reality and appearance is so alarming that it could change even our main values and the way our countries are governed. Advertisement, politicians, job candidates,... everybody is eager to present an "image" that masqerades the real truth.

We watch ads on tv that are plainly lying to us. They make an incredible effort to disguise the real product presenting a distorted image. And we are so used to it that we do not even blink. We just buy the product or service in question. Our politicians know we are gullible. They tell us what we want to hear, not what they really think or what they are going to support in case of getting elected. The inconsistency of their message is appalling.

Some people say we are not so gullible and that we can see through this imaginery, pose and appearance. I am positive this is not the case. Maybe a small percentage of people is smart enough to discern. I firmely believe that the majority just swallows whatever is thrown to them. Just look at the social media, their opinions, their posts, their "beliefs".

If we do not do anything to stop all this reallity subversion we will end governed by unscrupulous people that will take advantage of us to advance their personal agendas.
