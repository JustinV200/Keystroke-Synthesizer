   There are many different ways to progress is activities. Some people are cooperative and some people are competitive. To find out which one would work best we would have to work side by side in the same activites. The two are comparable but one is seemingly better for the over all function of progress. To cooperate is far better than competing with each other for completing actions.
   To be cooperative with each other closes the door to nefarious actors in competition. In competition to go against another person will leave you open to sabotage by the other competitor. Sabotage can ruin the outcome for a person even if the person is doing better than the competitor. There is no true result when it is broken by maliciousness. To cooperate with others gives an incentive to work hard together knowing that the end result will be the same for everyone. Even if competiton drives everyone to do better than another, it leaves the door open for a cheater to try to be in first place. 
   Between competition and cooperation, cooperation will lead to to more trusted and lasting results. You never know how far your competitor will go to get ahead of you. If you cooperate to achieve results with others eveyone wins. The best we can hope for is a life in which everyone has a place and is on equal footing and cooperating with one another is the pathway to progress.
