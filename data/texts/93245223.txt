I believe everyone is different and so they are not more or less likely to be happy by either focusing on personal goals or the happiness of others. Additionally, some people have a personal goal of making other people happy.

For example, doctors, nurses, teachers are people that like to help others. For them, a personal goal could be related to making someone else happy. It's very common for parents to have a personal goal of doing whatever they need to do to ensure their children are happy. Spouses can also have a personal goal of making their significant other happy as well.

It's true that some people don't care about anybody other than their own, so they will only be happy if they are able to pursue their own goals. These kind of people usually thrive on goals that rely on making money and don't really care for anything else. However, personal goals can change as you get older so it's possible that at one stage of your live you only care for your own goals but as you get older (or your relationships change, such as getting married and/or having kids), your personal goals can change, or rather, you start prioritizing other goals and find that what makes you happy is not the same that made you happier in earlier stages of your life.

In summary, whatever makes you happy is not the same for everyone, and you can change your mind.
