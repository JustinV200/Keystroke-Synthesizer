Yes, I think that images and impressions absolutely have too much of an effect on people. All you have to do is look around you at any store or at any television commercial. Brightly colored pretty packages are made to attract our attention in order to make a sale. We are conditioned to want to be like celebrities even though they are in reality no better than us. We are told that we should want to be like them, wear the same clothes as them, vacation in the same places they do.         
Take the Kardashians as an example. This is a family that got famous for doing nothing other than being rich, yet we are forced to see articles about them in the news and online every day. These people are not anything to aspire to. Why aren't we seeing news about people that are actually making a difference in the world? It is impossible to ignore. I for one do not want my daughter to grow up thinking that being rich and famous is important. I want her to have her own aspirations and dreams, not what she is being told by the media that she should want.    
Politicians are another cesspool. They parade themselves in public as crusaders for all kinds of great causes but what do any of them actually do? Their public personas more often than not don't match the reality. Every day is a new scandal. 
As for me, I have seen the same H & M commercial probably 15 times a day for the last 2 weeks on television. Does it make me want to buy clothing from there? No, it doesn't. If anything it has the opposite effect and makes me want to stay far away and never buy anything from that brand. This is why advertising is not always effective. That doesn't mean that brands and people will stop trying to force their will on us though. In the end it just means that you have to use your own judgement to decide what is really worth your time, energy and money. That is the great thing about free will.
