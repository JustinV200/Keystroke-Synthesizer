Are people more successful through the practice of cooperation and following all of someone elses rules, or by competition where they can push themselves to do their best? Of course, everyone thrives to success differently. But is there a sure-fire way to achieve it? Each and every person will be successful how they see fit, which is really the only thing that matters. However, lets dive a little deeper into the subject.

When one cooperates, one follows the rules and does as they're told. Success is sure to follow this approach, but not in a manner that the individual feels as though they've done so on their own. They've achieved success by doing what someone else wants. Through competition, though, you show what you can do and that you can do it well. Through competition you're able to showcase your own strengths, and sometimes weaknesses. However, you do that on your own terms, not someone elses. In competition, you thrive on showing your best abilities. With cooperation, you only push your abilities as far as you're told. Therefore, you're being held back in a sense. 

Yes, we know everyone will do best how they see fit. But when you dive deeper and really look into cooperation versus competition, you can clearly see that competition pushes people to do better and be more successful. That feeling of accomplishment is everything, and the human mind thrives on that. We want to be successful and show off our capabilities to the full extent. Cooperation just allows you to go as far as whoever it is wants you to go, holding back your success. Thus not pushing you to be as successful as you possibly can be. 

Competition over cooperation.
