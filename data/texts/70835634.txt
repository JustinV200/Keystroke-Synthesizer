Materialism seems to be the motivational factor of the past generations.  It's the one thing that gets a person up in the morning to go to work -  just to make money and buy stuff.       
 
That stuff always leads to more and more credit card debt and a person's desires are never met.  They always see their friends and neighbors with items that they too want to acquire.

The older generations seem to be more materialistic than their children.  Proof of this is all the stuff in their houses that they either need to rent storage for or it's bulging out of every closet and drawer.  The sad part is that they need to get rid of it when their lives no longer allow them to live at home and they can't possibly take it all to the nursing homes.  Their children don't want all the collectibles and antiques during their years and are now faced with trying to find it all a new home.      

Fortunately the younger generation is starting to head down a different path and not acquiring so much stuff.  They tend to be leaning on becoming "Minimalist" after seeing their parents with all that stuff, but they also are guilty of materialism when it comes to collecting experiences and adventures. So it's human nature to be materialistic and never be content with what we have.
