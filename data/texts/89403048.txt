In my personal opinion I believe happiness comes when you seek to help others and do something to improve humanity. When we are self focused and self absorbed, we lose sight of what we're here for which is to raise the vibration of the Earth. By human nature, we are never satisfied no matter how much we obtain so it only makes sense that people experience fulfillment when they contribute to humanity.

Take for instance a millionaire or a billionaire. They have more money than they know what to do with, and since money is supposed to make you happy, they should be happier than most. But a lot of them are depressed unless they have some meaning in their lives. Some philanthropic efforts put forth by people who have a lot of money come from a sense of needing fulfillment and not just a need to be noticed and approved of by others.

If you're constantly seeking personal happiness and fulfillment, you'll find it if you do the right things that make you happy personally but after a while you'll return to your baseline happiness. If you look outside yourself at others, who are the reflection of you, you'll find never ending fulfillment because you'll never run out of people to help. There are billions of people in the world, there's only one of you.
