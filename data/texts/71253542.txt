   People often ask me why I'm so happy, to which I say happiness is a choice.  People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals and chosen purpose.  I believe actualization and freedom are happiness, so the best thing to do is figure out what's important to you as an individual and make choices that will support those priorities.  That long term careful tending of your goals will create a life in which you can be happy.

    Some may say that having your mind fixed on your own happiness won't work and only the happiness of others is truly fulfilling. To them I say humbug.  They may say one should focus on the improvement of humanity.  I say that is a fantastic personal goal to have,  but if your goal isn't lofty altruism then working towards that will make you unhappy.  That sounds like someone is trying to control me.  I remember the church pastor asking me straight faced for 10% of my money but telling me I could donate more.  That doesn't make me happy.

  Happiness is a very personal thing because it comes from having a dream and persuing it.  Dreams and goals are the stuff you need to self orient to in order to feel fulfilled.  Whether success comes immediately or after decades I believe improvement will happen along the way, and provide satisfaction and happiness.  Working hard towards your goal is good but it has to be paired with an understanding the real happiness is the experiences that have been had by one along the way.
