For the question asked I wolud like to answer that, yes images and impressions have way too much effect on people. Not just this generation images and impressions has always played a big roal in evolution. Even though most of the time these images are fake people like to enjoy it because it gives a sence of escapism to the person from his reality. Starting from kids to old people like a good advertisement.
To make a product interesting these images and impression are really important. Add a fun mascot and a good Ad a relatively simple ceral can become a sensation over night. That is why more and more companies try to add celebries and fun characters in the ads. There is nothing wrong with getting interested in a product by the image because it is how our brains work.
People tend to obsess with entertainers, politicians and other public figures because it is easy and fun to gossip about their life. Complain about how they are making the society bad and becomeing a bad influence on the next generation is easier than taking responsibility for their action and make a better enviroinment.
The effect that ads, movies, images and appearances bring to the socity seems to be big now a days so we have to be careful on what we are influenced by. This influence has both advantages and disadvantages. As a socity it is over duty to be careful on what we are moving our future to.
