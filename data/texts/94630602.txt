      In today's society, cooperation and competition is prelavent in society and the workplace in general. Most of us do one or the other. Sometimes we do both. It is easy to understand the pros and cons of cooperation and competition. This is something that I believe we learn, not something that we are born with. What experience we have faced in life also factor in to the decision on which we choose.
       Competition is a learned habit that begins as a child. We are often taught to compete in sports, academic gatherings and social enviroments. Competition helps us to get the leg up in the workplace short term. It helps us to be seen as the star, the top player, the one and only. It allows us to receive the victory all on our own. Ir gives us the immediate gratification of "I'm the best". This is quickly gratifying but unfortunately leads to a quick realization that you are on the top by yourself.
        In comparision, cooperation in the workplace leads to a united front. A team enviroment. It builds our character and propels us faster to our goals. Our successes are greater in cooperation because we all win. There is no I in team and that's even more obvious in a cooperation standpoint. Therefore I believe there is greater reward and greater accomplishment when there is cooperation in the process. We succeed in the end when we have the values of teamwork and cooperation and the great part is that you didn't do it alone. That also moves over into your personal life and your relationships which will give you greater satisfaction in life. Cooperation is the key to success.  
         Lasting accomplishments = cooperation.
