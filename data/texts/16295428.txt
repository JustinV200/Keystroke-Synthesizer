   Most people in the world are highly influenced by the images that they see on TV , in advertisements , and other media sources .  Often times , the images that they see , do not reflect the reality of the images or products that they are looking at . Companies , advertisers , and even social media influncers sometimes take advantage of this fact whenever advertising products and services .

   This fact can be shown in many cases of consumers buying products and services that they have seen advertised, to later learn that the product or service that they purchased , was not as good as what the advertisement had shown or claimed .  By looking at or reading reviews for many products online , one can see that many products and services , just do not offer the quality that there advertisements claim .

   There are some that may argue and say that the average consumer is well informed about advertisment deception , and that these consumers are able to make sound judgments when it comes to purchaseing products and services .  In other words , they may say that these people cannot be tricked through adverstisments and are aware of these deceptions .  However the numbers of bad reviews on many products , tells a different story .
