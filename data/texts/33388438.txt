Materialism is a common factor in today's society, and it is something that we often frown upon and cast scorn and hatred toward. It seems that having too many possessions, or in fact, having too many possessions that we are attached to or proud of, is something that most people would argue is unnecessary. The question becomes, should this materialism be the center of our scorn and upset, or should we really understand it as a function of our capitalist society? Materialism is just a by-product of a society geared toward selling and using products. 
We all know that most of the world operates with a corporate mentality of "what can this get me?" We all are working and spending our most precious resource - our time - to gain money with which to buy any other resource we need. At the end of the day, all the things that we are spending money on are relatively "materialistic" needs. We have adapted over the years and as we adapt and learn, we are producing more things that we have to spend money to buy. This materialism extends not just to products like toys, computers, or other goods, but also to things like internet, clothing, and vehicles. Some would say that we "need" these things in order to function in our society, but wouldn't that actually make materialism a function of society? There was not previously a need for internet - there was a time when it didn't exist. There was not always a need for vehicles - they did not always exist. So is materialism as we see it really to be as scorned as we make it? 
In summary, materialism has evolved over the years along with our industry and capitalist society. It has become a function of how we determine whether someone is successful in the capitalist society in which we find ourselves. So while we are scorning people for their materialism, we also fail to realize we are creating it by promoting the "need" for things as they are created to make our lives "easier," "more convenient" or "more full."
