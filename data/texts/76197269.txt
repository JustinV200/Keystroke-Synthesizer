       Lot of peoples are well talented in todays life and they are well educated too. so today, competitions are very high and people are must wait to achieve some things or waiting for prove his or her own talents through competitions. now we have lot of technologies to improve our self but If we want to prove ourself we need competitions and that are going to be long term success. This is a competitive world so we have to prove our self and it is must for our wellness.
       We have lot of resources to educate our own self but cooperation is also must for getting training with studies or something what we are going to get learned but it is not the main sources of our success. It going to be a part of our success but not the main part. cooperation is must, but we have to ready to face the problem in our success only through competitions thats going to be a full success or long term success.
       I have one friend he is very talented and well knowledged person he still pratices him self for achieving one particular thing and he has cooperation also . He also waited to participate in competitions because achieve through competion only long time achievement and he know that verywell. cometition is must for our success more than cooperation.
