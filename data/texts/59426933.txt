I do think that images and impressions have too much of an impression on people. Advertising is a huge, multi-billion dollar industry that is constantly at work trying to get our attention and get us to spend money. The way products are packaged is very intentional, as well as the way products are displayed in a store or on the shelves in a grocery store, to capture our interest and investment. Most of this goes on without us realizing it and impacts us powerfully in ways that we aren't even conscious of. 

When it comes to entertainers, politicians, and even our friends and neighbors, the rise of social media is a huge indicator that images and impressions have become more important than substance. People choose their outfits, their activities and even their meals based on what will make good content for Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok. We are raising an entire generation who is learning to compare their reality, warts and all, with someone else's carefully and perfectly curated highlight reel.

Someone who argues that we aren't powerfully impacted by images and impressions would have a long way to go to prove that point. It seems our entire culture is based around slick and glossy ads, flashing billboards, and whatever "influencers" claim is popular. Appearances are indeed mistaken for reality- "reality" shows feature scripts and manufactured drama, and people seem to care more about the graphic design of a political candidate's webpage than we do about their voting record.

In summary, I think images and impressions definitely have too much of an effect on people. I think we need to be aware constantly of the difference between media and reality.
