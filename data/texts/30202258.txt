Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic, It's a fact. 
Materialism is something that everybody hates, and likes, but sometimes they might not know they like It. However, It is important to our everyday lives. Everyone needs It, without it we won't have much to strive for, In fact, we might have nothing to strive for. Never feeling the satisfaction of getting something you always dreamed for, doesn't feel too good. Materialism is absolutely vital.

 People criticize others for being to materialistic, although they may not have realized It, almost everyone Is being at least a little materialistic. We all need something to strive for, work hard for, and in the end eventually possibly getting It. If everyone wasn't materialistic, people may not work as hard, revolutionary inventions may not have been made today, people may not even find much joy anymore.

 As a Muslim, I believe It's good to try to achieve many things In this life, but we also need to strive to get into the next life. (Heaven) But at the end, we all want something. Strive for what you want, have some fun. Although, It's very important to not be too materialistic though. The problem with modern society Is that with materialism, people may forget about the greatest reward at the end of our lives. (Heaven) While I think It's Important to strive for things in this life, never forget about what we really need in the end.
