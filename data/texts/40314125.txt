Since an early age we play games that speak to modern materialism. "If you were stranded on an island, what five things would you bring?". We think rather about our possesions that we can't 'live without' rather than the things that would help us survive in such a situation. This is a game which speaks volumes to what we value as a society.

Today, we are a society that stives to have more than our neighbor to "keep up with the Joneses" . We want to have the biggest house, the best cars, the best blank insert here. This very nature keeps companies developing products to make the world of today obsolete. But what happens to all of our possesions that we replace? Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. 

Right after being placed into storage, these products of the past end up in landfills. They slowly destroy our world by breaking down into the earth, water and wind. Not only does this materialism destroy the planet at the end of a product's life cycle, but it also leads the need for more raw materials. Materialism destroys the planet at an increasing rate, the faster new technologies emerge, the faster our current products become obsolete and the faster they end up in the trash. We take from the Earth and what we give it in return is garbage.

We have started to think about sustainability. Products that at the very least put back into the environment what they take. Hopefully this concept will be adapted enough to reverse the cycle of destruction materialism has created. Let's hope it's not too late.
