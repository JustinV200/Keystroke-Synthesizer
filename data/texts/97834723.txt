As a Christian, I believe we were born to serve the Lord.  All of my life,  I was raised in the church, and have had a personal relationship with Jesus.  I've tried to be more like Him, and this gives me the desire to help, and bless others, with the resources and blessings that I have been provided.  I believe happiness is found when we are focused on and serving others.

Whether looking at a flower, or seeing the smile on the face of a child, or listening to the waves of the ocean, it all makes me want to share that wonder with others.  I understand some people are more goal oriented, and feel they have the right to only seek their own happiness, but how can someone be truly happy unless they can share their dreams and talents by using their talents to ease the burdens of others.  Helping others can help us feel better about ourselves, and to realise that even though we have our own struggles, we are blessed.

Some people seem happy on the outside, and they seem to be very successful people, making millions of dollars, and maybe even making others laugh.  But, if they have nobody to share their life with, and they go home to an empty mansion every evening, can they be truly happy?  I believe that would be a very lonely life to lead, and I would not want that kind of life for anyone.

A person can become successful in their personal goals while only focusing on the happiness of others, but I don't think they can make other people happy while only focusing on their personal goals.
