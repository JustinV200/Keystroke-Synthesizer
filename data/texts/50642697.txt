Some say  beauty is in the eye of the beholder , happiness could be the same thing.  What makes Xander happy may not make Gwen happy and vice versa.  
Religious leaders would tell you true happiness can only come from serving others. I think C. Montgomery Burns might disagree with that. It is said money cant buy happiness  but I have to think millionaires are a lot happier than the poor . 
One wise saying that makes  me believe the religious leaders and those who think happiness comes from others is the adage.  if Momma aint happy nobodys happy.  Which is very factual in my house  where if my  ultra pleasant wife  has reached a boiling point  my childen and my moods and disposition will suffer as well . 
Look what happened with the recent suicide of Naomi Judd .  If you look at suicide rates of people  you would find more proffessionals who failed  than any other category .  Kurt Cobain  is another person who had it all and still wasnt happy. 
In my personal opinion  evidence dictates  that money doesnt neccessarily buy happiness. The most important thing in your life should always be family. Not bank account not career or any other traps that will not love you back .  This is not to say a good career  and a fat wallet will not make your life easier and better because it probably will. it just is not most important. That is a position  that should always be filled with loved ones . 
Helping others not only gives you heavenly treasures  and the peace of mind that entails it but joy here on earth has well . I for one like looking in the mirror and being able to sleep soundly at night knowing I ve made somebodys day a little better . 
My final bit of knowledge is  a meme I ve seen go around the internet that states  . Dont give your  life to a company that will replace you tomorrow if you die today.  Which should be a clear warning to everyone  personal goals and careers can destroy you .
