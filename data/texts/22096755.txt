What creates true happiness?  Is it the realization of our own personal goals?  Or is it a focus on bettering the lives of other human beings? 
As someone who has spent large periods of time focusing on each of these avenues, I would argue that true happiness can be found somewhere in between.  
I spent about five years as a single adult, dating when I pleased, traveling when I pleased, and all while enjoying plenty of funds to do so.  While I found enjoyment in many parts of my life, I also experienced long periods of loneliness, emptiness, and meaninglessness in my selfish existence.  Who or what was I doing it all for, especially when I still felt unfulfilled?
I spent the next five years in a committed relationship, and we now have a child together.  With very little outside support, I have put my hobbies, goals, and career advancement on hold to raise our child in the time of COVID.  I struggled very much mentally at first with the forced selflessness of motherhood, and we have also struggled financially during this time.
Have I yearned for the hedonistic lifestyle I used to have?  Of course.  That said, I would never give up what I have, because at the end of the day, my life has more fulfillment and meaning than ever.  Now that my child is a little bit older, I am getting back into my hobbies and even able to bring him along!  I am now able to focus on my own self-care a little bit more, and it brings me even more happiness because now I know not to take it for granted.
In closing, I would say that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on a combination of their own personal goals and the happiness of other people simultaneously.
