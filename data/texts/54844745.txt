Though ladies enjoy shopping for clothing and shoes, have you ever observed a lady who is content simply because she has everything she desires? As a result, materialism should be chastised for at least the three reasons listed below.
 
To begin with, it is misconstrued as a means of attaining genuine happiness and love is the key to a happy existence, as a everbody who knows mother teresa knows. people find tranquilly and fulfilment via love, yet a desire foe material things leads to a never ending cycle of appeal. Many wealthy people, including  Jackie chen and Bill gates, who dedicate their lives to philanthropy can attest to this.

Second, meterialism skews the definition of the term materials. It exists to better our lives by providing our basic requirements and allowing us to grow. My grandfather always claims that I do now, but that people were simpler and easier. people are now willing to give up everything, including their health in order to make money. what a bunch of idiots. Last but not least, accumulating wealth and spending money deprives peoples of their ability to experience love, care and other pleasant emotions. Families disintegrate, schoolmates no longer have fun together and even married couples rarely communicate.
