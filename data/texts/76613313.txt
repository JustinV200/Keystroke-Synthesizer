I feel like we would be happier if we focused on our happiness, along with the bettering of the world. In the end, you have your happiness to think about overall though! You only have so much time in this world, and you only have so much time to be happy and make a difference in one way or another! 

It would make more sense to be happy, and let that happiness spread to others, thus making the world a better place, one smile at a time! It really does, just take a smile to brighten someones day! 

Our time on this earth is limited, and happiness seems to be going away more and more everyday! Same with bettering the world. If we could turn things around, it could change everything for humans! 

I feel like people would be happy if they focused on their personal goals, thus creating a better world for those around them. I really do think these two things go hand in hand, in the end! We tend to gravitate towards big things, and right now the big thing is to be so negative, and it is creating a negative world! We have a big chance to change the world right now. It can start with you, taking a chance to smile a little bit more, and following your dreams. 

Improving humanity could totally be someones personal goal, they really do go hand in hand. This could make someone very happy, and whole in the end.
