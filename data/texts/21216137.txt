Competition and cooperation are both important key aspects  in our day to day lives.To break the two down on how important they are, competition on one hand helps the keep everyone on toes and this makes everyone to work extra harder to ensure the always remain at the top at any particular time. cooperation on the other hand makes it easier to achieve the objectives easily and within the shortest time.

However, I am a great supporter of cooperation more than competion since in cooperation people work in unity and there are no instanes of conflict since the people involved are not trying to outshine the other. Cooperation helps to solve some of the issues that may arise such as hatred or people having low self esteem which may be brought about by competition.cooperation also makes it easier for people to achieve their targets sine one does not have a lot of pending workload.

Cooperation played a great role in my previous job where I worked as a sales and marketing agent for a particular company. We formed a team within the sales and marketing agents which which helped us to reach out to more clients while working in the field. This made it easier to achieve the set targets by the company.

In conclusion, Cooperation will play a greater role to achieve objectives than competition since the work will be made easier and the amount of workload will be minimal.
