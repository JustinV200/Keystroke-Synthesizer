Since the beginning of time images and impressions of people have had effects on society.  Some people are put on a pedastal by others for sometimes the most simple act in today's age.  Some people may not even know someone but only their image to others and judge them solely off of that.
  
I think that people's impressions and images are effecting people too much these days because of it always being on social media. Since media has become so popular, news organizations now have hidden agendas where they want to ruin someone's image in the public view.  They do this because they want to hurt that person's chances in their profession and turn their fans and audience away from them.  I think if it were not for others placing so much focus on someone's image that this would not even be an issue and it would not be happening as frequently.  

The fact is that social media has given everyone access to so much information that they begin to form impressions and images of people.  They then expect that this person lives up to that image even though that might not always be the case. People never actually know what might be true and false and have to take everything with a grain of salt.  I also think that people are too worried about the lives of public figures and need to be less affected by the public figures' lives than their own. The people who are most effected by images and impressions of others need to focus more on their own lives than worrying about public figures.
