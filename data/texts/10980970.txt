Materialism is very important in our life , the belief that money are most impotant things in our life . we have more money means enjoy our sophisticated life and joyful life with our families . The society  many people are rich but some are midlle class and poor .The high class peoples have been more criticized than materialism.living on own decision is great things as self conficent.
    

 Everybody in the world they enjoying their own way of happiness , most people nowadays are earning people taughts they too have their own dreams too buy things and make them happy is most soulful things. money is important in our economic world , every little things are matter,but the low class people aim should low but he or she can't buy anythings ,its criticises.


The criticism is everywhere in the world, so we should not listen to the people who pin to us . we are the one who can make and change the world but others could not take this point.once we feel we are happy we can work for ourself and earn of us  apparently we keep motivated and work dedicated to our goal .Therefore cristicsm is major part in the human life but the fact remains that most of us spent most of our energy producing and consuming more and more stuff. materialism is modern life changes their own way.
