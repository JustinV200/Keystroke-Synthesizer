Reality is what we perceive as relevant. We all have our own vision of what is real and what is not real. It is what the mind and the soul percieves as real or as a imagined. A type of twilight zone in our brains. We drift into a type of time warp where things are so out there. Like the ads for flying on a plane. One has  to experience it to apprecialte the ride not just the name of the airline.

For me, I seek to look around me in the realm of what I actually see that is in plain sight. Nature is real as I hear the sound of birds chirping and see them flying in the sky. When I feel the fur petting a cat or eating and drinking as a form of reality.

Some would argue that reality is not only what one sees or hears but what one can pretend to see and hear. We all have different vivid imaginations. Just like our nightly dreams that we have. Some are too real to be just dreams. However, we wake up and realize that yes, they are just dreams.  

To conclude, we all have a need to take life as it comes, no matter how it presents itself. As individuals, seeking to see life in our own space in the universe.
