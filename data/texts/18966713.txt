People often say the key to a good life is happiness, but where does happiness stem from? Does it come from focusing on one's own goals, or does it come when one focuses on the happiness of others? The truth is, it is a mixture of both.

While we can feel happy focusing inward on ourselves, we cannot be fully happy if the people around us do not exeprience positive emotions as well. Happiness can be contagious and it is important for our own happiness to see others also thriving and happy. While what it means to be happy differs between people, everyone should have the chance to experience it in their life. If the people around us are feeling down, it can effect our own happiness.

In my own personal life, I have so many goals that propel me and bring me joy. Traveling is a passion of mine and I strive to travel the world. While I am actively working on this goal with each country I visit, my mind still wanders to the people I meet along the way. Whenever I visit a new place, I often meet people who are exerpiencing sorrow or hardship. I feel I cannot fully enjoy the experience without offering them some form of help. It feels as though it is almost a duty to bring them a little bit of happiness. If their day is brightened even just a small amount, it increases my happiness immensely. I feel I am happiest when I am silmultaneously working towards my own personal goals as well as ensuring the happiess of others. 

People truly need a balance of self-happiness brought on through achieving personal goals, and ensuring the happiness of others around them. This allows for maximum happiness. Happiness will look differently from person to person, but so long as everyone has a glimmer of it in their lives, the world will be a better place for all. The true key to happiness is allowing everyone the chance to experience it.
