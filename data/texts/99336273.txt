In this world nothing will work without the images and impressions. Everything has become more impressive and nobody knows the value of ability and their importance.But humans life always judged by their talents and not because of favorable impressions.Fox example when we see the advertisement we don't think about the quality and the natural beauty, just like that we buy the things they are showing in advertisement and we buy it without knowing the value of it.Through this advertisement they are promoting their own life. My brother has very much addicted to watch this ads everyday and this has become a part of his life and it has spoiled his studies.

Recently he has been sevearly attacked by depression and stress because because of this appearances and impressions we face in everyday life.One fine day he decided to visit a doctor about this problem. The doctor has counselled him and explained about every single talent and ability he has within him and this motivation has changed him a lot and he is now living a satisifed and healthy life. He learned  that abilities are the true form of success and the impressions will lost one day.


Through the ability and talent we have within ourselves will be the permanent one and what we think and see will change our lives and we can achieve great heights if we follow this daily in our routine life. We should shange ourselves to shine because what this media shows is all about impressions and beyond that there are many hidden abilites which will makes you shine in your profession. One should always remember that ability is the true value of life and it is very much more important than this impressions.
