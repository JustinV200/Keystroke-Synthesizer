Competition is the enemy of creativity, and cooperation is its collaborator. When you compete, you each try to crush the others' ideas, to replace them with your own, but when you cooperate, you bounce ideas off of one another, trying to build on them. It's the difference between trying to knock one another down, and trying to build a human pyramid.

Yes, competition is fueled by the fear of failure, and that can be a powerful motivator, as is the drive to win, to best a rival. But isn't the desire to lift other people up also motivating? And isn't the absence of fear more liberating to the creative force? Fear might make you desire to come up with a truly new idea, but it doesn't free you to do the sort of daydreaming, indulge in the necessary flights of fancy, to generate those ideas. Cooperation does, because by erasing that fear, it takes the pressure off. You are free to spitball notions you might have been embarrassed even to voice in a competitive atmosphere.

Plus, cooperation makes the other person's idea an aid to your own creativity. You can take their idea and improve upon it. It's still theirs, but it's also now yours, and it's better than it was before because of your contribution. And they can do the same thing with your original thoughts.

Thus, more ideas are generated, and all of them are improved. Best of all, none of you feel like a loser when you get done. 

Beat that, competition.
