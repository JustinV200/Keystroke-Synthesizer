      Materialism is a human thing. Most people are more materialistic in now a days but I don't think so because I think they the suituaion of todays life and acting like they are materialistic. I think people are being act like materialistic because of their surroundings.
Every one needs love, friendship, turst and understanding more than money. I think our eduation system is fully responsible for the changes in people needs
      Now a days more people like to spend time with friends and familys more than their outdoor enjoyments. people with more materialistic is not a problem but it may affect our modern society more than products or technologies. I hate being more materialistic because it may give lot of problem to our happiness. 
       I think now a days lot of people are living their life with full of happiness with their family , friends and they enjoy being a good human in the society they spent more time in involving new things to help others and they are not at all materialistic. In my opinion people are act like a materialistic but they are not materialistic and they were happy only because of their good human behaviors and thay help people more than money or mordern things. I assure that modern society never gonna  being criticized for being materialistic.
