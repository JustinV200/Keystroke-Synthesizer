Happiness comes in different ways and in different forms. In some cases some people find it very exciting to see someone succeed and accomplish their goals while there are other people who don't find happiness in seeing other people accomplish certain goals. People's views on happiness are based on the way they view themselves, others, their surroundings, and their future as a whole. 

Through personal experience, I feel like both focusing on personal goals and the happiness of others brings the same amount of happiness. For example, If you accomplish a goal that you have been waiting to achieve, that will bring you a huge amount of happiness and motivation to continue achieiving more goals in the future. If you also want to put your goals to the side and view someone else succeed and achieve one of their long awaited goals, this will also bring you. happiness and motivation. Viewing something good unexpectedly happen to someone always brings people a sense of hope and motivation to achieve something in life.
