In my opnion, people gain more success with competition because we think from birth that we have to do better than the person next to you. Competition is healthy and necessary. I grew up in a house with 5 sisters, I was the second youngest and I had a lot of competition with my sisters and I think it made us all better. We are all great moms and are successful in life.

At the same time I feel like competition isnt always healthy when it comes to the general public. Some people fold under pressure and really cant cope with the idea of striving to be better than everyone. They say that we are all created equal but are we really? I know the 1% has it made before the rest of us so there is no competition there in my opnion. Wish it wasn't this way, but it is.

I am a stay at home mom of three girls and they have debates and competition every day and I think in the end it will make them stronger and the type of women we so need in the world. Even when they make me want to pull my hair out, I know I am building strong women! That is about all I can say on competition, some like it and some don't but to each their own. Thanks for coming to my talk, have a great day!
