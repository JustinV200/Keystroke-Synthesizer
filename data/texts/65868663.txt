Madonna once said, "I'm a material girl, living in a material world," but what does that mean? What constitutes as being materialistic and is it a good thing or a bad thing in society's eye? 
In today's society, it is nearly impossible to not be materialistic. Society protrays owning items and having "things" as being "happy". We, as a society, work full time jobs and some times, also part time jobs, just to "reach our goals", whatever they may be. Society should not be faulted or criticized for having goals and dreams to work towards, even if our goals are toward "things".
Others may say that materials don't matter and that being "materialistic" can be harmful to society, espeically to our youth. However, then what are we all working for? As much as society doesn't want to admit it, money makes the world go 'round, that is a fact. We cannot pay for gasoline for our vehicles or food for our tables on hopes and wishes. It requires money, which we must make for us to have those things. Modern society is already very hard on men, women and children, why should having "materials" be more fuel for depression and low self-esteem among society. Approximately 1 in every 5 adults have diagnosed depression or anxiety disorders, some those symptoms stem from feeling inadaqete by comparing to others that may have more or have better things. 
What qualifes us as having material? Is it a car? Nice clothing maybe? A boat? Brand name food? The fact is that being "materialistic" is dynamic and changes person to person based on beliefs and class. Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic.
