Too many people buy into what images "sell," even if they may not reflect reality. We also rely too often on our impressions of others, particularly those with a public persona that may not line up with their true personality. Just because a singer croons the most beautifully romantic melodies, for example, doesn't mean that in real life he's never raised his hand in violence toward a partner. While this kind of mismatched perception is a common theme in the way that "everyday" people look at celebrities, it's just as relatable when examining personal connections.

A primary example is social media. On Facebook, for instance, users -- friends, coworkers, family members, acquaintances, and other may we actually DO know -- generally seem to be "living their best life." If these posts were an accurate depiction of the page owner's actual life and disposition, then it would appear that everyone is happy all of the time (judging by the feel-good photos), that everyone is always upbeat (judging by the endless stream of uplifting and empowering memes), and that no one is ever bothered after a breakup (judging from the I'm-better-off-anyway rhetoric). 

The bottom line is that we can't take what we see at face value. We only see what people want us to see! If you care enough to know, then you should care enough to find out. That's for people who are in your tribe. For those you admire from afar, including celebrities, you should think twice before putting them on a pedestal because, as the saying goes, everything that glitters ain't gold. 

Finally, as it is with people, so it is with things. Beautiful presentation can be a distraction (think elegant wrapping and a velvet bow housing a cheap gag gift) and take the focus away from what's most important: what's on the inside.
