We've all heard a saying, "A picture tells a  thousand words ".Image help us to learn, grab attention, explains tough concepts and inspire. Bright colors capture our attention easily and remains in our memory forever. Humans are able to process images at alarming speed.
      There is a saying ," First impression is the best impression". People often form impression of others very quickly, with only minimal information. When a person attends an interview it is his first impression that makes a positive impact on thers. If he fails to impress others he might fail in his attempt. We categorize people into different groups based on common characteristics. Most commonly it happens automaticallyand unconsiously.
      The problem in social categorization is it can lead to stereotyping or even prejudice.  With the first impression we fail to notice their talents. The impression are unchangeable as  long as we know the deep side of person's character and achievement.
       My uncle has a girlfriend with a constant fascinating smile and charming appearance. But she never has sympathy for poor people or for injured animals. So, impression is only a spontaneous images of others that formed at the instant. But that impression will never last foreverand won't have much effect on our judging.
      Better communication and deeper understanding are more effective methods that help us to know the true characteristics of a person.
