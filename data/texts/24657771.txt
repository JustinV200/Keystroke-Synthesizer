Competitive nature or cooperation, which is most powerful to become an successful individual?
Obviously, this is the competitive world and everyone should fight for their own success. Competition is the only motto that triggers a person to achieve more. What is success? winning over something or someone under certain condition. So, without competition there won't be any success. 

Competition is only the thing that drives every person to move forward. If there is no competition, for what the people would run for? Anyway there won't be anyone to take away the target from you, so ultimately people will become lazy and waste time. Think a race of 100 meters, if there is only one person to participate in it, there is no need for him to run fast, he can complete it at any time. Think the same senario for 2 or more people, the race will end within few seconds, that's what the power of competition. 

You can say, in corporate society people has to cooperate with each other to show the power of unity, there too competition stands ahead, you are competing with the other society to show your cooperation. There is no point in cooperation if there is no competition.

So, what I conclude is even though cooperation is required to achieve the target, Competiton is the only driving force that makes each individual to cooperate with each other to achieve the success. Thus, Cooperation comes under competetion. Always competitive nature will make an individual to become a successful person.
