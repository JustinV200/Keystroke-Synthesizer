Acoording to me happiness is comes from successing in our dream. Which is the best happiness for me. For example I dreames to buy my own house from my childhood. Due to lack of my parents income We can't make our own house. So, I study hard to get high salarid job. Due to consistent hardwork I get proper promotions with in the 5 years. I started my job as intern in one reputed company. Due to my hard work and my qualification I am not promoted as team leader in my team with good salary. By good income with permanant job I can able to achieve my dream now. This year 2022 october I going to buy my own house. I can now able to say I am a dream achiever. I feel very happy and inner pleasure. I thank god for every second to give such oppurtunity to work harder and honestly. I am now able to satisfy my family all needs and loves to spend time with them with out any mentel pressure. So, People only being to be happy only from theirself only and not from other. Others are not important for our personal happiness. So, always be happy. But many people states that We can be happy only by helping others or with the help of others. Incase we having low income but poor person asked for help means we can give few money to him. But which may cause him happy but not that happiness comes from full satisfaction or in full form. We also having family by spending time and money with them gives pure happiness and proudness.  Thank you so much to share my feelings with you via this writing gives me good chance to open up.
