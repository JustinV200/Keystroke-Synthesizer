Yes, images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people. Most people judge only with their eyes, and that can be deceptive. We see a beautiful model in an ad, and believe that's what people look like, when most people don't. In many cases, even the model doesn't, because so much digital manipulation has taken place. And in so many instances, people act in their own lives to meet those images.

Women purchase all kinds of beauty products, spending money that maybe they don't really have, in order to reach a beauty ideal that doesn't even exist in real life. This can have terrible effects on self worth, self esteem, and expectation. Outspending what you really should be spending can have a terrible effect on someone's life and well being in other areas, and yet, people do it every day in order to reach an ideal from an image they saw.

And then this also affects other people, because men will expect women to look a certain way, based on the images that they're seeing as well. They end up being unhappy with the real women they actually meet, because they don't live up to an ideal that they have seen - an ideal that isn't even real. Digital manipulation can almost make anyone look like anything, and nothing is actually real anymore. 

We end up in a society where people are putting so much effort in to being or finding an ideal that doesn't even exist. And it ends up giving us a situation where what we see and what we look like becomes more important than what we are. People never try and see beneath the surface, because we've been almost trained to only focus on the surface. So you end up losing out on things that could be beneficial, because the surface isn't what you find appealing.

This holds true even for products. If we don't like the outside package, we don't even pick it up to see what's inside.
