     Where does happiness come from? This is something I have struggled with for many years. As someone who struggles with depression this is a question that replays in my mind constantly, day in and day out. Some people think that happiness comes from completing your own goals, but from my own personal experience I think that happiness comes to you when you have shared a piece of happiness with others. 
     Something that goes viral everyday and has since the internet was invented is human kindness. There's nothing that warms my heart more than participating or watching others helping both humans and animals out of the goodness of their heart. I'm not talking about the videos of people doing something kind just to film and post it to social media. I'm talking about the videos that show what it truely means to help. The ones that show the "random acts of kindness" that can change anyones day for the better and the ones that have people coming together to help others that may be struggling. 
     I've been on both the receiving and the giving end of these random acts of kindness. I've paid for peoples food orders, tipped service workers a significant amount, left gift cards in diaper boxes for parents to later find. I've left coupons on products that I know I wouldn't use. I've left food at the food pantry to help families in need. I get so much joy in doing these random acts of kindness and it truely does bring me happiness thinking about the recipients happiness. 
     In conclusion, I think that if everyone shared a little piece of happiness with someone who needed it, then happiness would run as wild and contagious as Covid. If we all worked together to help and look out for each other and just make it our goal to make at least one person smile everyday I really believe that the world would be a happier place. Depression rates would go down significantly.
