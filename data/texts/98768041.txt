In today's it is important to have collaboration of all sorts, whether it is in sports, business, or daily activities. While it is important to value cooperation as a tasks for everyone in all careers, so does competitions. In sports, there are severeal teams or players that have been in constant heads with one another. What if I tell you the way for success is to have competition with other peers. Here I will show my reasoning to how competition can provide success in the long run.
 While I understand that coopereations is the one of the main reason for success, they also have a bit of downside of it. For example, imagine if a class is doing a class project in all of the students are grouped into three or four. With three or four students, they can make the projects done without the hassle of a solo student. While it is pausible, there is a possible outcome that a student has not done any work besides the other working students. It is not fair for the other students who have done all the work, all while one of the peer does a bare minium. That is why it is important to have competition in everyday lives.
With competition it can give the peers to motivate them to improve their livelihood. For example, in a market world the companies offer their products to their consumers for a reasonable price. In that case if one company have witness with what other one is doing, the chances of having to compete with said company would make a difference. In closing, it is important to have competition in order to find success with one another. Without competitions where else would it be if it were to cooperate when one is barely doing a minimum work.
