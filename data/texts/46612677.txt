As a young kid have you ever looked at an complex figure that was meant to make you think. Some people would call that an optical illusion which is when you look at an image from one point of view and then change your postion the image would change. In reality there are two images that are captured in one and this can go further than just an image it caan be applied to people to. For example, we see in almost every election the people being swayed to vote for one person, because on the outside they old an image that is all good and respectful to everyone. In actuallity that person is not wwho they seem and is actually an abuser of women and power. But since people are caught up in an image they forget to look at the bad that person did in the past. This is why I think that images and impressions have a large affect on people.

 Now lets go back to the politican who is runnig for office and has a long history of being a nasty, corrupt man. That same man is able to change his image quite easily, just by going out intom the community and helpin gthe poor or donating money to a worthy cause. The people who are voting will choosee to look at the politician through the persepctivve of being good and in the comunity. In other words the politician was able to do so much good that he would be able to change his image make people forget his past. Because of how easy it is to change an image or impression i believe it has too much of an effec ton people
 
Whether if your voting for the next governor or our out shopping an image or impression can play animportant role in how a person feel. It has such an effect on peopl because as humans we have a hard time of seeing past the surface and remebering past event; that may be shadowed by recent activty. this is why images and impression have too much of an effect on people.
