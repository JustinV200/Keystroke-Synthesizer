People often ask me what makes you happy, you always seem so happy. I tell them it is a combination of things, not just one or two. Of course it is also very important to take care of your health to live a full and productive life. Without your health a person's perspective can change and they cannot live life to the fullest. When people ask me that question I have to think a bit about what makes me live in mostly a happy state of mind. I recall events that made me the happiest and think about the kinds of people that have made me feel the happiest throughout my life, and those that didn't. Then I am able to give them my perspective on what has kept me in a happy state of mind throughout my life so far.

In my opinion it is important to enjoy your work, whatever it might be, and to also do your best to make other people happy and to be happy for them to be around. I try to stay interested in a variety of things in order to be interesting to others,  and always keep an upbeat attitude. Complaining and criticizing not only brings other people down but puts me in a poor mood too. I try to bring things into a conversation that make whoever I am talking to think a little bit, or maybe change their perspective on things. I try to genuinly be interested in others and open to hearing things that I don't necessarily completely agree with but that can challenge my thinking.

In closing, I think that I am the happiest when I am happy at my work and making others happy. If I can bring a smile to another person's face I smile too. Lifes circumstances certainly can be a challenge but the happier a person is to begin with the easier it would be to accept the challenge of finding a way to stay that way when things can bring you down. Always think of people who have it rough and be grateful for all that you have even if your life isn't perfect. There will always be people that have more or have less. Life is short enough, I want to enjoy mine, and I do. It is all a choice.
