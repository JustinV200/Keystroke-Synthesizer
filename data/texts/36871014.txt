There are many images from media and advertisements that bombard us daily. From movies, to the 24 hour news cycles,  to the vast abundance of images and memes from social media.  Do these images affect people in a negative way?  Do they obscure reality and make people believe things that aren't real.  My contention is that indeed they do have a negative affect on people.

With so much media at our disposal,  it can be hard to differentiate what is fact and what is fiction.  Many so called journalists on cable news are just opinion speakers,  but many people take their information as fact.  Many people think that opinions expressed on late night talk shows are fact.  People seem to put more value into someone's opinion if they are famous.  And many famous people have no hesistancy in giving their opinion on just about everything.  But we should not value an opinion of someone more than other's just because they make a lot of money.  Being able to put a basketball through a hoop does not make someone an expert in politics.  We should be cautious of what we take as the truth before all facts come out.  Look at Jesse Smollet or Nicholas Sandmann as reasons to use caution.  How many times have we been told about the identity of a shooter or their motives,  just to find out that the media was completely wrong.  Yet people continue to believe in false narratives and they are spread like wildfire over the internet.  Too often,  false information and assumptions are put out before the actual truth is known.  

There are valid reasons to trust some media,  and not all opinions need to be scrutinized heavily,  but it's best to err on the side of caution.  We should all be reasonable about our judgements,  and not let idolization of celebrities and atheletes overshadow our common sense.
