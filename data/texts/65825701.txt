Happiness is a universal, positive topic that all humans desire to feel and achieve. There are many different beliefs around it. In this essay, I will explain why happiness is more likely found when people focus on their own personal goals, rather than the happiness of others.

Happiness is temporary feeling, however, focusing on personal goals can help people feel this longer term and more strongly because they can directly control more aspects of this journey. For example, when a person sets personal goals, they have more control over the outcome. If a person focuses on the happiness of others, they have less control over the outcome, as there are more variables in trying to make others happy. While it can seem selfish to think that people should focus on their own personal goals, rather than the happiness of others, it makes sense if the goal is personal happiness. Happiness is most likely achieved when there are less variables involved in completing a goal or getting into a specific mindset. 

While another perspective may argue that focusing on the happiness of others will help people find happiness, I would disagree. Others have so many different variables that dictate their happiness. It would cause more stress and worry trying to find ways to make each individual happy, rather than focusing on happiness for oneself. In addition, a person's personal goal, for example, could be serving others or giving to others. That could be a personal goal that makes them happy and benefits other people around them.                                                 

In conclusion, people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals. This is due to less variability in dealing with others' fickle happiness factors and more control with successful outcomes. This does not have to be selfish - people can set personal goals to serve and give to others on their pursuit of happiness.
