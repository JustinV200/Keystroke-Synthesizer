Since everyone is unique, I can only go by my own experience, when it comes to discussing happiness. For me, my own happiness is tied-up with, how I can help make the people around me happy. 
For instance, when I was working, I was an office manager. As I gained experience, I began to notice that if the people around me, were happy, then more work would get done in the office. And overall, things would run much smoother, if everyone was content. So, in this instance, the happiness of others, meant that overall productivity, in my workplace, would be high. And, if productivity was high, then this made me happy, because I felt like I was doing a good job.
Another example, of the importance of making others happy, has to do with the welfare of my family. If one member of my family is really unhappy, then this always affects the happiness of everyone else. I think as human beings, most of us have an innate desire, to care about 
our family members. So, as a caring human, it is important to me, that my loved ones, are happy. When they are, then this make me happy, too.
Now, I know that some people seem to be happy, only when they are persuing their own personal goals. However, since people don't live in a vacuum, I don't think this is quite true. Some of the most miserable people on the planet, are considered to be the most successful. However, their success, didn't bring them happiness. Look at the designer, Ms. Spade, who committed suicide. She was a successful designer, but this obviously did not bring her the happiness, she needed.
Because I have been on this planet for 63 years, and have some experience, dealing with all different types of people, I know that the happiness of those around me, is important to my own happiness. When people are happy, everyone is more productive, things run smoother, and life is more enjoyable.
