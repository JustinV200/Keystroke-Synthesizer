Materialism is a part of our everyday life. Between social media and seeing other people's lives, materialism is greatly influenced into our lives whether we realize it or not. I believe that most people do not even realize they are being materialistic until someone says something about it. 
I feel that most people are in a way attracted to materialism, again, whether we realize it or not. We always see what other people have and assume it makes them happy, so we want the same things for ourselves to experience that same kind of happiness when in reality, it is just a short term fix for happiness. 
Some people make argue that materialism doesn't affect them, but in reality, it is everywhere and influences our opinions on what to buy and who to be. A lot of people associate things with happiness, whether it is clothes, the hottest new electronic device, or a shiny new car. I think people need to take a step back from most social media platforms and figure out what really makes them happy instead of what makes other people happy. Everyone is different in what gives their life purpose.  
In conclusion, I think materialism is a huge issue in our society. People not only contribute to this, but businesses as well. I feel that there should be more education on minimalism, so tht people can realize that it is not material objects that make them happy, but the small things they already have in their possession. I think if people realized this, they would stop buying so many material possessions and focus instead on their relationships to bring them happiness.
