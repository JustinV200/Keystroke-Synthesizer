I think people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others.  I believe that if people try to live a lifestyle of making others happy that they will feel fulfilled and happy themselves.  It is important to put the happiness of others before one's own happiness to improve the lives of other people.  In relationships, when we make others happy our lives seem to be more enjoyable and happy.

In our lives, we often live many roles and are given opportunities to make others happy.  For example, being married gives us an opportunity to help our spouse to feel happiness through the love that we share.  Another example of focusing on the happiness of others, is if you are a parent.  As a parent, you want your children to be happy and feel loved by sharing happy memories with the family.  When we focus on the happiness of our close family and friends, it makes the own happiness in our own lives grow.

The gift of making other people happy is a sure way for people to live a very happy, fulfilling, and rewarding life.  Putting the happiness of others before your own happiness first is a selfless way of showing others that you love and care about them.  Our lives are often filled with many opportunites to make others happy which in turn often leads to our own happiness.  The joys of making someone else feel happiness in their own lives is a good way to make your life full of happiness as you live it.  Our lives are deeply enriched when we focus on making others happy and we often share this happiness with them.  Giving the gift of happiness to others is an ideal way to find happiness in our own lives.
