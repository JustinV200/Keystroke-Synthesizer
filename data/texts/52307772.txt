                    In my opinion , materialism not only misleads to the wrong way of pursuing happiness but also makes them become unaware of the wonderful things they have on hand.
Materialism isn't bad. people who possess a lot of materials or not , Should be good. That'll make a powerful society. materialism has allways been a competing religion , by practioners who seem not to be aware , that they religiously have compulsions for material needs beyond  perceived necessities , or that are convinced that there is no self-soul after death.materialism religion , is when one is convinced in material self , but not in immaterial self's-soul.

                 The materialism presence of some ideals only increases the energy of man , helping him not only to reach heights, but also to fight the inevitable difficulties. if materialism is the reliance exclusively on material values that such an extreme case i admit , and it may not. in any person a glimmer of some ideal concerning him,  his companion.his country , life , etc. Another thing is that you cannot use other people's ideals , and it is necessary to create your own, or at convert other people's ideals for themselves.

              One of the obvious reason why the society is materialistic is the way the media and society  celebrate and worship those who have material things.
