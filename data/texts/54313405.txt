Image is everything. It probably shouldn't be, but in the modern world we are innundated with images everywhere and it overwhelms our senses. It shuts off our brains and tickles the more instinctual corners of our mind.

Why did Donald Trump get elected president in 2016? Was it his great success as a businessman? It would not seem so. He had many bankruptcies in his past. In fact, it was reported he was penniless by the late 1990s. But he made a comeback on television in the early 2000s with a reality show portraying a broad caricature of a successful businessman. Nevermind his past, or his actual net worth, he played a purported billionaire on TV with a penchant for firing people and viewers ate it up. Trump was able to parlay that manufactured image into a successful presidential run by 2016.

Human beings are programmed to be superficial. While humans have large brains with remarkable reasoning ability, we evolved from more instinctual stuff. We like shiny things, symmetrical faces, staring at a fire and a host of other nonrational stimuli. If a fake billionaire pushes the right buttons, we respond with the lizard portion of our brain, and he can make himself our leader with an oversized personality and xenophobic appeals.

But we have the ability to overcome these superficial traits. We can fact check the things politicians tell us. We can resist the often racist appeals to our baser instincts. We can reward those politicians with more substance. It is imperative that we don't let our emotions and instincts drive our important decisions. The free world depends on ration instead of instinct.
