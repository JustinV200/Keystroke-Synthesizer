It is my belief happiness is obtained when serving others.  It is said there is 'more happiness in giving than receiving', I think this is true, especially in my life. Because to see others happy from some action I've been allowed to share with others and to see their reaction to the gift of giving, means a lot to me.  Especially when the recipients are children.  The reaction from children is the purest.

Unless being trained by an adult to act otherwise, children are innocent and are blank slates with no alterior motives. Therefore, the joy that is seen on a child's face when receiving a gift or simply seeing someone who is familiar to them is priceless.  Also, the simplicity of what can be the reason for happiness means a lot.  It does not have to be something that is expensive or even requires money.  For children, it can be something simple as playing a game, singing a song or taking a walk, enjoying nature.  

Material possessions, for me has brought the least of what can make me happy.  I have ascertained that what can make me extremely happy is Knowing I have the utmost Spiritual relationship with a Greater Power.  Because I am Seeking to Know more about my Creator can bring Supreme happiness not only to my life but the lives of other human beings. 

The Worship of YAHAWAH and YAHAWAHSHI means EVERYTHING to me.  I learn
more and more about the most precious Relationship by reading and studying the Bible.
When I learn about Them and what is Required of me,  I learn about myself.  I am SO Grateful that a Spirit of Seeking The Most High GOD, Learning about HIM and the Attributes of the TRUE GOD is a Privilege and I find happiness in having this Privilege to Learn about my GREAT CREATOR.  The Fear of YAHAWAH is the Beginning of Wisdom.
Having TRUE wisdom about the MOST HIGH GOD, YAHAWAH is Pure Happiness to me.
