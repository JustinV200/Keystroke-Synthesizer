Happiness comes to us in many forms.  Some find the most joy in the pursuit of personal goals, while others find it in the pursuit of improving humanity.  Others find it in different ways or in a combination of ways.  Nonetheless, happiness is essential to a meaningful life no matter how one finds it.

I believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals.  While this may sound selfish, people must take care of themselves before they can help others.  If one does not pursue his or her own goals, he or she will not have the capacity to help others.  If one does not find joy in themselves, how can they find joy in others?  We, alone, are responsible for creating our own happiness.  We cannot rely on others to do it for us. 

Some people say that you shouldn't focus on yourself until you have focused on others.  When everything else is taken care of, then you can make time for youself.  Even Christians often promote the idea of putting others above yourself.  While this is good in theory, it isn't always possible.  If you spend all of your time and energy focusing on the happiness of others, you won't have any energy left to take care of yourself.  You are the only person that you will be with for your entire life.  If you can't find joy in and of yourself, how can you live with yourself day after day?  You can't fix others and assume it will fix yourself.

Finally, there are many means by which one can find happiness.  It may be in personal goals and ideas, assisting others, or in a combination of ways.  Yet, the most important way to ensure the highest level of happiness is to focus first on oneself.  You must find a way to do the things most important to you.  Then, and only then, will you have the energy, time, and mental capacity to work on the happiness of others.  You must find happiness in yourself, because you are the only one who can do it for you.  That is how you find true happiness.
