Though there are many theories on what make people happy, I believe happiness is derived from focusing on one's own personal goal. Whether your goals is to drink more water, learning a new magic trick, or improving yourself to get a promotion at work, no goal is too big or small to achieve happiness within yourself. 

It's very important to give yourself clear and obtainable goals, while celebrating the steps in between. Setting an obtainable goal outlined with small steps allows us to track our progress and see our own growth. We should encourage and celebrate the journey just as much as the end result! Even if the first step is just trying, that's further than doing nothing at all! Life is full of so many opportunities to do the things that bring us happiness and joy. 

Though some would claim helping others bring them happiness, if you can't find happiness within yourself first, how can you truly find happiness through others? I believe happiness is contagious and the more satisfied we are with ourselves, the more we can then focus on helping others. This in turn can bring you even more joy and  happiness, but the first step is focusing on oneself.

In conclusion, focusing on yourself and your own goals will help you achieve happiness in life. No matter the goal, embrace your journey and growth. Once you are happy with yourself, you can then share the joy with others.
