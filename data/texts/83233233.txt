Images and impressions definitely have too much effect on people. It is evident in social media. People are consumed with how many "Likes" they get on their comments. Even the news media constantly reports on how many followers a person has, even people I have never heard of. Some of these influencers are only popular because their followers think they are cute, pretty, funny etc.
 Some politicians are elected based on how much or how little hair they have. Many people base their decision on how to vote based on social media comments. They never try to determine if candidates and even qualified. 
Others may say "this is not really a problem", but I say it is. On some TV ads with celebrities and entertainers, I hardly know what they are advertising. The business name is hardly mentioned. 
Some people relate a memorable song to the product without knowing if the product is even worthwhile of spending their hard earned money.
 I recently got a song stuck in my head because the commercial played none stop on TV. After a day or two I could not remember the business product, only the song. 
 After a politician repeated tells the same lie over and over about his opponent, some people actually believe it and start spreading the lie on their social media content.
 It is exhausting to watch and hear, and in the final analysis some of these lies and slight of hand diversions will likely backfire and cause some consumers like myself,  to dislike a product and avoid buying the product.
