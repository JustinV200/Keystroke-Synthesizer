Where do people find their true happiness?  Does it come from pursuing their own goals and dreams, or perhaps is it found elsewhere, Perhpaps in the happiness coming from others?

I can not speak for everyone, but for me personally it is my belief that people find their happiness when they are on the path to finding what they are passionate about and what they love to do.  Someone once said, "if you do something you love, you will never work a day in your life".  I truly believe that. I really wish I had taken that to heart in my young days.   I have worked for 30 plus years at a menial office payroll job, and it is just that, a job.  Somewhere I go everyday simply because I have to pay the bills, not because I am excited to go there.  

What I am truly passionate about is animals, and I feel that I would thrive in any position where I was able to interact with them, whether it was studying them or taking care of them.  That would be something that would excite me each day, fill me with joy and contentment.

I think however think that it would be possible to find happiness along the way if you found happiness in others, for example feeding the hungry.  Being able to see the faces of satisfaction and contentment and happiness on the less fortunate would be a great feeling no doubt, however would that feeling always stay the same?  Would you continue to reap that reward, or would the situation have a negative effect on you seeing people in such need?  While yes, it would be good to be able to help, I for one think something such as that would eventually bring me down.  

Real happiness and contentment for me comes from my heart and my passion, and thats why I choose me.  My wants, my goals, my dreams for MY happy.  When I am happy in the things that I do, then I can spread that joy and happiness to others around me in other ways.  Maybe even I could even feed the hungry?
