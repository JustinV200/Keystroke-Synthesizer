         Success may also by cooperation or by competition,but in my point of view success must be through competition only. if we have competition we learn many things particularly we learn the failures,we learn to correct our mistakes.without competition success will not complete.
          If we get success by cooperation,we cannot learn things,we started to depend on them. in that case success is not ours,we cannot enjoy it.in competition method that success is completely mine i struggled and get that place.i treasure it for lifetime.i manage everything because i already faced the failure.anything we get will definetly comes by competition only.
          In this competition world if we follows cooperation method it is not a innovative one,it is a regular unskilled one.we should be innovative,our thinking should be innovative.if we compete with others means only we think in different way.it plays a huge part in success.but sometimes some people also follows cooperation method but in my view i suggest everyone to compete with others,learn by mistakes,face failures it helps to grow our success well.if we get success by competition that success is a healthy success, we take that full credit by us. so finally do people get more success by competition way  only.
