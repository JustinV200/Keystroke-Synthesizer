Many people ask how success is truly achieved. One idea is that success is reached through competition amongst individuals where the true winner is revealed. Another idea is that success is the result of cooperation involving multiple individuals working towards a common goal.  The most successful for long term outcomes results from cooperation. 

Cooperation is the readiness of an individual to put aside all personal opinions and values to work towards a common goal. Cooperation involves collaborating with others and often an appropriate protocol. This collaboration allows individuals to use their knowledge and share ideas in order to find the most beneficial solution to the problem at hand. At the completion of the task, it is the colloaboration that has resulted in a successful outcome. This idea of collaboration is often emphazied in work enviornments as well as personal/social life. 

Competition often brings negativity to the situation as individuals feel they must out-play their competitor in order to be deemed the winner. This negative persona often results in anger and disappointment when the one member looses and often the focus is shifted on the competition instead of the end goal. Additionally, this competition often makes individuals focus soley on their own personal gain and not the success of the team to reach the end goal. When comparing cooperation to competition to achieve longer lasting accomplishments thus leading to success, teamwork and cooperation yield better outcomes. 

Although competition can be used as benefit to increase individuals attention and desire to complete the task, it should not be the primary focus for long term accomplishments. Instead, cooperation in all settings, work and social life, will bring out positive attributes of individuals and enforce a positive environment to achieve the common goal. Thus, cooperation should take precident over competition to achieve long term success.
