     People often wonder where does happiness come from? Is happiness an emotion that comes from taking care of yourself or do you get true happiness from helping others? I believe that happiness needs to ultimately come from yourself first. Can you truely take care of others and ensure their happiness if you are miserable inside?

     I believe that if you are truly happy with yourself, if you've taken the time to deal with your personal and childhood traumas you will be able to spread happiness to others. Taking the time to meet your own goals will put you in a better position to help others in need.When you are not deeply happy inside the things you do for others may feel good in the moment but that feeling is fleeting and your left feeling empty again. Happy people radiate it from themselves and often change the mood of a room just by making an appearance. Spreading happiness you don't feel would be draining.

     Some people would argue that a life lived in service of others will make you the happiest. I believe that the flaw with this is if you don't stop to take care of yourself you will burn out. When you spend your life lifting everybody else up first you are left at the bottom. This doesn't make you selfish, it makes you more efficient in spreading happiness. Making sure you are also taken care of is essential to be able to take care of others and hopefully everyone finds something that makes them happy.
