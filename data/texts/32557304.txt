Do you want a new car? How about a 65 incb television? Maybe, just a cool new mug you saw while you were shopping just because it had your favorite character on it?
Of course you do, we all do. So, why do people act like they hate materialism? The least materialistic person I ever met will come shopping with me and buy at least one thing she does not need every time. 
We need to face the fact that not only are most of us very materialistic but that materialism is good for the us and our economy. It is alright to want to buy more stuff if you can afford it. You are helping more people than you even realize. You are keeping businesses open and keeping many people employed with the money you spend at the places you buy your stuff. 
Also, materialism makes people happy. Happiness is sometimes very hard to achieve so if even for a moment you can have a little bit of happiness because you bought something you have been wanting for days, weeks, or even months then buy that thing. Do not let anyone tell you that you are too materialistic. If anyone does then buy them some Starbucks because odds are they love it. 
Materialism is needed in our society and there is really nothing wrong with that. Keeping people employed and business afloat will never be a bad thing and you get to keep you new thing. Enjoy it.
