There are two schools of thought when it comes to achieving success. One being the idea that competition can drive a person to rise above the rest to victory. The other being that through cooperation with others, more significant achievements can be accomplished. I firmly believe that human nature has shown through cooperation we have demonstrated our greatest ability to succeed.

It seems pretty simple when you think about it. If there is a goal given to a group or a single person, the group is at a far greater advantage. When multiple people come together to work towards something, you're bringing together multiple points of views, multiple skill sets, and multiple support systems. There is great power that comes with having an overlap in the same desired outcome. When you cooperate, you push one another and don't want to let each other down. The collaborative experience is energizing. There is always someone there to pick you up if you falter.

It is sometimes said that forcing people to compete against one another will motivate them to get the best out of themselves. But if you're in a hyper competitive environment and you want to succeed, you will find yourself wanting to cooperate with others to generate the greatest competitive force. In conclusion, even the most competitive people will want to cooperate with others because they know it gives them the best chance to accomplish a goal.
