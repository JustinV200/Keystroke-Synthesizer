       In our day to day life everything gets overrated by its own appearance made by the producers.That makes us to buy that product and hypes our childrens desire too.Things which are decroated by its outlook are 99% dangerous.
      While we watching TVs we see a lot of advertisements which makes favourable impressions but those advertisements say a little about the products.All of us are made mistake by trusting the appearance and we shouldn't stick to reality.Those things are the tricks for the product producers.If we went for shopping we shop only the things which was most colorful or by the celebrities we like was acted an advertisement for that product rather than the contents.
       And in social media we are stacking to some public figures, celebrities, influencers and some politicians. All those peoples are not showing their real life in social media. Rather than they show only things which they create artificially.Some people posts their pictures for fame and some people posts meme and videos for kidding others.Many can use fake accounts and post picture.We the peoples always trust the social media blindly today.
      We all are far away from the reality and got stick to the imagianry world.All too often, What we are think we see becomes far more important than what reality is.So we have to overcome from this and make our future and childrens to get stick to the reality.
