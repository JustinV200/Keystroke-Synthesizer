 Have you ever felt mislead by everyday images around us?
On the daily, we come in contact with false advertisments, where the packaging is very pleasing to the eye, but the product itself leaves a lot to be desired. It would seem that manufacturers these days put more effort into creating visually appealing packaging, than they do creating effective products within the packaging itself.
 I recently purchased a new hair product, where I knew the product was going to be absolutely fantastic, going by the beautiful packaging. The bottle was done with lovely pastel colors, giving me a "sun kissed beach vibe". I just knew that once I used this product, my hair would feel and smell like a tropical paradise. The product itself was very watered down and smelled of rancid hand lotion and rubbing alcohol.
 This doesn't always pertain to physical products though, we also encounter this type of situation with people.
You may look at someone and think that by the way they dress, look, and carry themselves, that they are a "certain type of person with specific qualities". My ex-husband is a good example of this; nothing more than an "image manager"
 Taking into account that "looks can be deceiving, whether it be a person or product, we need to be more diligent and pro-active in the decisions we make in life. Taking more time and care could potentially not only save us money, but also heartache.
