Say an individual accomplishes something extraordinary, such as getting a promotion at their job or winning a championship game. These positive events can lead to a higher satisfaction with their personal performance and additionally, higher levels of happiness. If individuals utilize their time to focus on their own growth and self-development, then they will be much happier and fulfilled in life. Therefore, I believe that people are happier when they focus on their own personal goals as opposed to the happiness of other people. 

Working on personal goals and focusing on one's life-long dreams can lead to higher levels of happiness. For instance, I decided to take dance classes as a hobby two years ago. Although this decision was difficult since my parents extremely upset about it, it was something necessary that I needed to do for myself. I never felt fulfilled in life, and additionally, I did not have a reason to wake up in the morning. My first few classes were rough, and I remember how uncomfortable I was in the beginning. From time to time, I enjoy looking back on my old dance videos and reflecting on how much growth I've made over the last two years. Seeing my improvements and my confidence increase makes me happy. In the end, I do not regret this decision, but instead, I am glad that I did something for myself rather than worrying about how others would feel.

Although it is vital for people to focus on themselves when it comes to happiness, it is also still important to focus on the happiness of others. For instance, people can partake in service work around the community, volunteer at a local shelter or food bank, or donate old clothes to non-profit organizations. Doing community service work increases levels of happiness through the satisfaction from giving back to others. However, happiness and an improved emotional well-being is much more likely when we focus and achieve our own personal goals.
