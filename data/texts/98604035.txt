       Modern society is focused on stuff. We buy more and more items, and items are not designed to last as long as they were in the past. We are throwing away and replacing items faster than ever before, and adding to landfills, polluting and wasting natural resources. It used to be that you could buy a refrigerator, and it would last forty or fifty years- now you would be lucky to have one last ten. 
      Heavy wooden furniture used to be passed down from generation to generation. You could keep the same bed frame and dresser set your entire adult life. Now, cheap, disposible Ikea furniture lasts for three years, breaks and goes to the dump where it rots with a thousand others. Clothes are the same, Fast Fashion has destroyed clothing. Clothes used to be much better quality, you could wear them for years and then donate them to a thrift shop and someone would be able to still get years more use out of them. Now things are so cheap, you wear them three times, they rip and are ruined. Then into the ladfill they go, with the Ikea. Kids toys are garbage, useless fad trinkets that are designed to break quickly. Many aren't even made to really play with- they are just something to acquire and then get bored with.  
      Society should be criticized for being materialistic. We buy more things than we could ever need. Social media and FOMO has fueled this need that people have to acquire things. There is always competition and everyone needs to have the latest version of cell phone, the hottest and most fashion forward wardrobe, to remodel their houses every five years. I have seen grown adults fighting in the parking lot of McDonalds over Disney Happy Meal Toys. Such a waste.
