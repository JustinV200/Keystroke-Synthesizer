People are more likely to be happy when they focus on their own goal by pursuing their dreams.when one achieve one's goal means it gives more happiness on their life rather than thinking of their life.But helping others and making others dream success also give happiness to the people not more than one's own happiness.
People are believing that focusing only on goal and running behind it gives happiness but the real fact is achieving the goal by hardwork and  get success in our life gives more happiness .According to my opinion one should satisfy one's own needs by some  goal and enjoy our life and also if we have enough money we should help others when there is a need, it will make others happy.But one should think one's own goal and happiness first rather than thinking about others.
people make others happy by fulfilling their small needs once their need increase we cannot help them,it makes them sad.But if we have own goal  means we should work hard to achieve it and get satisfy only when we achieve our own goal and if we experience some delay in achieving our goal means it encourage us more to get focus on our goal and achieve our goal by pursuing our dream.So people are more happy only when they focus on their own goal rather than the happiness of others.
