                                                      
                                                    Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?


Everyday we see people, places, and things. So have you ever asked yourself if maybe the things you look at could be effecting who you are? For example if I woke up everyday and only read magazines with skinny people in them, how would that effect me? I would be torn to peices because I am not so small in the waist. Whereas if you opened up an exercise magazine everyday that showed you how to become fit. How would you react then?
Images tend to be seen on our phones, televisions, and computer screen everyday as I stated. So wouldnt you say that we do percieve ourselves based of these things? Take another example for instance. You love the color black. So you start looking for all things and items and clothes that are black. Our brains tell us to do this because we have seen images of things that were black and became addicted to said things and transferred it. 
Just by my answer to this question alone you can tell that yes; images and impressions can effect people to much. Though its based on each person indvidually and through what each person takes in and exputs out. If this answer didnt persuade you then let me give one more example. Tiktok is a new app used daily. Other people veiw your videos and by your personality and creativity decide if they like you. This is a great example of this question.
