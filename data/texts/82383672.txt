Materialism -- it dominates our American society.  Each and every one of us is subject to its power, driving us to want more and more regardless of need.  But is this materialism, this passion filled drive to produce and acquire greater quantities of everything, from electronics, to automobiles, clothing, real estate, jewelry, and everything under the sun really generating the happiness Americans crave?  I think not.

The more clothes I own, the more closet space I need.  With more closet space comes a need for a larger home.  And how many shirts can I wear in one day, or even in one week?  Do I really need the latest fashions?  Do I really need to buy that new pair of Nike tennis shoes or those shimmering jogging pants?

How much of my own happiness is derived from consuming things?  The truth is, way too much.  There is a certain fishing lure that I purchase every time I see it in the store, regardless of how many of them I own.  And the salmon I catch in the Spring each year are never enough.  I want to catch more and more of them, even beyond the number that I can possibly eat.  

Materialism is just a never-ending treadmill that keeps me, in fact keeps all of us, running at an uncontrollable rate toward a goal that can never be achieved.  That goal is happiness through cosumption.  Consumption can never bring true happiness.  Happiness cannot be created through gathering of external things.  It can only come from within oneself, and it is intangible in nature.
