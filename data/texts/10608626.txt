            Hi I'm Dhana Clark, I wish to talk aboutsome people are thinking that competition is the only way to achieve success, But that is not true at all. We have to know how the competition and co-operation works. There is big difference between the co-operation and the competition. Competition makes enemies for you in your life, otherwise that is not helping you to attain success. But Co-operation is more than attaining success. It gives a good people around you. And gives you a permanent success in your life and carreer.

            We need to know about co-operation. It gives you new experiences in your life and you will know how to face the critical situations, you will learn how to manage many people and your labour's. Competition gives you Failure most of the times when you are watching, what other people are going to do. that is totally a waste of time though. When you are starting watching others what will they do, for your competition with them. That will not gave you Success because you forget your own Ideas and your plans.

             We have to change that competition is the best way to attain a goal or success. Otherwise we have to learn and get proper knowledge about Co-operation. Victory is only made by experiencing more failures and more struggles in your carreer and your life. Failure makes you stronger and you will learn how to reduce mistakes. Thank you.
