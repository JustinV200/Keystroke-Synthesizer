  In society today, moving up in the ranks is not as straight-forward as it once was. No longer can we expect to be promoted within the companies we work for by just having worked there for a nominal amount of years. Now, we are expected to know more and be better than any other potential candidate up for promotion. But what makes us "better" than the rest? 

  While competetion is an important factor to motivate us to improve our skills, cooperation is what makes us stand out from the crowd. If you think about the decision to promote someone from the perspective of leadership, this may give clarity as to why utilizing the route of cooperation is more beneficial than competition. 

  The person you decide to promote would be working closer with you. You would be communicating with them more often, so you would not want to promote someone who is always causing tension when a direction is given. It would not make your day any easier if said person was constantly bragging about their skills or complaining about their colleages' productivity. These might be attributes of someone who is only focused on the competition. 

  Some may portray a "cooperative" person as being soft or easy to use, but this is not always the case. A person can be motivated by the team work involved in completing any tasks that are asked of them. They are in it for the greater good of the company and not self-focused. These people make awesome co-w0rkers and great role models.

   It is important to tap into your competitiveness in order to keep yourself motivated to learn as much as possible about the position you desire, but also keep in mind the characteristics that make someone a pleasure to work with.
