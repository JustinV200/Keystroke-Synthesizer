Well heppiness is not that easy to explain as many might think. It can depend from people situations and the time we are in which is very important. For example if we go back one ceuntry we will find that happines is being able to provide for food and warmth in a normal home, wether in todays life that is something normal which is being take as granted most of the time. 

With more and more years pass, technology advances, comfort in our lifes gets higher and happines grows much further to achive in every day tasks as people in the past used to do. That is why todays generations fight so much with depression, anxiety and other issues. 
Enistein said the Ignorance is a bliss as the less you know the happier you are in life. 

So we arrive to the conclusion that happines is not having more possesions or attaing more knowledge as that either fades or burdens you more emotionally or mentally. What I am trying to say is that we need to enjoy little thing in life to be truly happy. Life by itself is beautiful and is worth enjoying everything that this amazing world has to offer.
