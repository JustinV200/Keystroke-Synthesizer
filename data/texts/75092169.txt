If they are not loyal there is no mean for co operation and team work success .  example for co operation  is hospitals without cooperations of doctors and nurse it can't treat paitent .

Competition :
          In compitition  there will be always an winner and a loser . it depends on as what we need . it motivate us to work hard just to win our opponent .  It gives us relief of winning the success , it help us to give more effects , more energy to win , more power to success .  But  my believe is that there should be an healthy competition .
