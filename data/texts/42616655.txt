In competiton pepole only thing about to how to win  and how to achieve  their goal and they don't think about right or worng.competition give people more energy and they put more effort to get the goal.They do anything  to achieve the goal .In this there no enjoy or rest only focus is to achieve the goal.work hard is their quote.

In cooperation people work together to achieve their goals with the team .In this non of people get sufferedand the goal also achieved easily.but there is one major problem is until finish the goal every one have to work together otherwise it cannot be achieve.in this every work have been split and shared with people .so the word has been done easily and they have time to recheck is the work done properly .
