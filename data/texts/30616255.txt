The question of whether or not people should be criticized for being materialistic is a tricky one to dance with. In my eyes it's not so much a question of critizing those who dabble in materialism but instead those who are too materialistic for their own good, to a point where it becomes destructive.
While I personally don't hold material things among the highest of importance, I do understand that for many people it means a great deal to acquire the things that they've always wanted to own. They can be symbols of success, physical representations of all of the hard work an individual has done to achieve such things. They can bring joy and happiness, even if but for a short time, helping to ease some of the stress accumulated in attaining them. They could simply be a way to show off a bit to family, friends, and neighbors. A harmless indulgence.
For me, it's when materialism consumes someone wholly. When an individual becomes recklessly obsessed with owning the best and the most expensive things before everyone else. When those people care more about possessions than they do their own loved ones. When the simple wonders and beauty of life itself are lost to the raging inferno that is one's relentless efforts to have it all. That is when someone should be criticized for their materialistic habits.
One of the true secrets to life is moderation, in so many ways. Enjoy the finer things from time to time, but never let them take over your soul and effectively reprogram who you are as a human being.
When Death is at the door, you will not think of those once proud possessions fondly. You will slip away quietly, wishing you could have but just a few more moments with those you once held dearest to your fading heart; those you likely lost in your insatiable quest for meaningless stuff.
