    Many people believe that materialism is something that is on the rise as our society grows. Does this mean we are envolving or moving backwards? Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic, and people should be concerned with how it is preventing our society from moving forward. 
    Firstly, materialism should be criticized, because it is an endless cycle. People work to buy things and buy things so they can work. An example of this would be working hard to buy a nice coffee maker, so that person can have nice coffe to help them be able to work more.
   Another reason is because it creates a feeling of emptiness in people. It makes them feel as though they are not good enough if the things they aquire are not as good as what their friends have. People are continuesly spending money on upgrading their material things to keep up with friends.
   Lastly, it is agrued that materialism is what we are evolving to do and is important so we can grew as a socitey. There are more important ways we can grew as a society such as medical break throughs. People need to be more focused on improving phyiscal and mental health over aquiring stuff. Stuff only has meaning if it is given meaning by people. 
   In conclusion, modern society should be criticized for being so materialistic. Materialism can become an endless cycle. It can cause people to feel a sense of emptiness that can only be filled by new things, but money can not buy happiness. Also, there are many other ways we can make meaningful progress as humanity.
