       I am not fully agree with the statement but i believe in the survey that the best optoin to start is to go for our happiness.We hould concentrate in our happiness and also to help others.If we focus on ourself by spending time andenergy on our thoughts and our actions that help us to achieve our happiness and our needs.if we wont focus on ourself than we cant able to help for others also because if we have money or some other thimgs means only we can able to provide it for others,without having anything then how can we help others.
   It's amazing that how we stand on ourself taller and walk more confidentally and are playful and more happy.It is easy to focus on others and not to consider about ourself but it own't lead to that much of bigger profit in our life.
    Without some time for ourselve andhaving good relaxation we may having a negative impact on things we are trying so hard to maintain.focusing on ourself bring much hapiness and it leads good relaxation for our body and also to our mind and it does not leads to any depressd state in our personal life and it does not lead to any diseases inside of our body.
