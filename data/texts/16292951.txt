To many, one's sense of "sight" is our most appreciated ability because it allows us the opportunity to perceive the world that surrounds us, both live and in color. In fact, branded advertising has preyed upon this human trait to the extent that firms can manipulate imagery to affect outsider perceptions. Consequently, it is not uncommon for people to formulate judegments and opinions on merely what they are "seeing" because it shapes their personal "perception."

Furthermore, since people have a tendency to be overly-reliant on their visual impressions, one can easily come quickly to judging a "book by its cover." Therefore, it would not be absurd for someone to consider their sense of sight as a "visual impairment" that impedes one's ability to truly see things as they are. In other words, it is common for people to jump to conclusions without actually taking the opportunity to experience the cirumstance or situation firsthand. Ultimately, one could assert that one's sense of sight can be manipulated, which is where the notion of "stereotypes" or "judgment without reasoning" derives from. 

In conclusion, I feel that people do place too much emphasis on imagery as a matter of affecting their overall impressions instead of actually taking the time to understand and educate themselves on the circumstance at hand. To a greater extent, since what we "see" can be manipulated, I do believe that people place too much emphasis on imagery and impressions to affect their way of thinking.
