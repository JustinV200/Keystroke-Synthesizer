Have you ever asked you self what truely make you happy? I ask myself this question almost every day. When i ask myself this question, the answer is always the same, my daughter. She is the one thing that makes me the happiest when iam down, its like she can feel when iam upset.
Some people believe that money bring them happiness, others believe its love, others belive that its other human beings. Myself is not one that belive that money bring me happniess. It feels like know matter how much money i get i still have to spend it at the end of the day so it goes away fast. On the other had love also doesnt last forever for me. I have found myself thinking i loved someone but at the end of the day we still end up seperateing, so i feel that looking at love for happiness can also get you hurt at the end. I for one is the type to believe that human beings can make others have happeniess. I never understood how much having your own child with your personilty could make you so joyful and happy.
So it doesnt matter what brings you happiness wheather its money, love, or even your children, everyone is different and have different feelings. So do what make you happy!
