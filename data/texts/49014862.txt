Images and impressions have too much effect on people because they don't see the whole picture. People only see the main image and that can be very persuasive and deceiving to the normal eye. 

News reporters only put out the wow factor of the image when it can be something so much smaller. That's why everyone has been so deceived by the Coronavirus. They only see what is in the media. Nobody gets to see the one hundred percent facts about the virus. They see everyone is dying because of this insane sickness when in reality, why are they not showing all the people who overcame the illness or had very mild symptoms?

When something as tragic as death is put on television it sucks everyone in to keep them attracted to the media. When the media focuses on the school shootings, it's all about who the shooter was and not the young lives that were damaged or taken. Why does the media insist on bringing up the shooter when they should be keeping their name off the press so that society doesn't recognize that they will be showcased in the event of an awful tragedy?

We are shown things from the media that the world shouldn't be evaluating. It's important to keep in mind that not everything is what you see. There is a whole story on the other side of that picture or video that your eyes would not believe. The media wants you to see the bad things in the world, but there is more to life than the evil we live in.

Never follow what you don't see. There can be a bad image on anything you can think of, but if you look further inside of what is presented to you then you may come to find that your eyes deceive you. Us as a society need to be more observant of our surroundings and the world as we know it. We don't let people tell their own story, we let the media showcase the worst of it all when in reality, there is more than meets the eye. Give the world a chance to tell their own story in their own words.
