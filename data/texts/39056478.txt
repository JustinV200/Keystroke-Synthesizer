Is being materalistic bad for society? Many critics believe that society is focusing way too much on materitalistic material and and could ruin relationships. For instance, a person could focus way too much time on their smartphone vs spending it with a loved one. That is true as we humans spend time in our smartphone way too much, but it is important to not let it control you. However, having materials is great to have in order to uplift a person's mood and have something that a family can pass on for many generations. Modern society should not be criticized for being materalistic.

Spending a person hard earned money on materials can uplift a person's mood. For instance, if a lady is grieving a death of a loved one, then why should anyone stop her from buying a very expensive Louis Vuitton bag. Many would scoff at the price, but in this scenario, this lady has been wanting to buy that bag her whole professional life. This could give her the extra boost in morale that she needs into order to get back to normal.

Another example is a necklace that is has been passed downed generation after generation. This type of material is so important for the family history. For instance, you should the smile that came from the young lady's face as her mother gave her the necklace that her grandmother wore. Wearing this necklace is tradition that has started in the 20th century is continued into the present.

Society should continue to be matertialistic. While people can get fixated on materials, it important to not let it control you. As we saw in the examples above, materials can bring people together or make someone's day. Let's become more of a materialistic society, and the world will become a happier place.
