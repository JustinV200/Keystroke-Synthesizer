Materialism is a modern buzzword with negative connotations. If you are materialistic, then you are seen to be insecure or shallow. However, all humans are materialistic to some degree. A key trait of humans is their ability to use tools in order to lead a productive life, and tools are materialistic by nature. People should only be criticized for materialism when they are making inefficient use of resources. Humans are expected by society to be productive, so materialism is fine (within reason) if it helps someone to do that.

Take for example, a Macbook Pro. It is a device that is the quintessence of materialism. However, many people rely on this tool to earn a living. They use it to earn thousands, if not millions of dollars per year. Same idea with a camera. If they always buy the newest camera on the market, should they be criticized for being materialistic if they use their cameras to earn millions from posting YouTube videos? Another key example is a car. Sure, you don't need a car to survive, but it helps people quickly get to the store to buy groceries and get to work on time, without spending their entire day commuting. 

Now for the examples of "bad materialism". Buying an item of clothing that you know you will never wear is a terrible waste of natural resources, and a waste of the human labor resources that were used to manufacture it. Buying five cars so you can have a different one to drive to work everyday is an inefficient use of resources, and someone should absolutely be criticized for doing this. Similarly, using a giant truck as a "status symbol" for personal errands is a shameful waste of natural resources, and is immoral on many levels.

Long story short, members of society should be diligent in their use of materialistic goods, and be mindful to not overconsume. No one expects you to be a monk and not use any materials at all. Be reasonable with your purchases and don't buy more than you need to accomplish the task at hand.
