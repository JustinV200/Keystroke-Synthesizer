First, people judge us by our impression on their first sight. We have to dress neat and clean. Whether it's formal or causal is not importnat but, proper dressing makes the first impression. Also, the method of communication and behaviour wants to be good. When seeing someone new or they are already known people, we have to do good gestures to make a good impression.

Everyone knows that while attending interview we have to dress properly in formal. The Proper dressing gets half the job in the interview remaining is to be on the good communication, proper answering and good behaviour. Some people impress others with their knowledge and skills in the interview.

We have not to create but to have the good impression of us by others. Talk good, respect elders and higher officals. Use all the good skills to make great impression in work. Whatever, good image and impression somebody don't give importnace to it. The greater the good impression, the greater the good effect. Bad impression made us to loose respect, opportunity, trust and many more good things in the society.

Thus, the images and impresssions does have effect on people but, it is based on the views of other's.
