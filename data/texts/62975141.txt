The subject of competition and cooperation as they pertain to greater achievementn the workplace or in school is an interesting one.  I personally believe cooperation is the way to achieve the best and most honest results.  It is much easier to work with people to achieve a goal than to try and compete and work alone.  

While competition does have it's strong points, I believe that in the workplace and in academics it can lead to undue stress and is more likely to result in cheating or in other dishonest methods of achieving the desired outcome.  It becomes more important to win and beat your opponent as opposed to genuinely believing in the cause and putting out your best work.

I think in the workplace and in most acedemic projects, cooperation is more like to result in a better quality outcome.  More people working together means there are more ideas and people may see things in a way that they hadn't thought of before.  The drive to beat the opponent is eliminated and all efforts become focused on accomplishing the objective.

While I do believe competition has it's place, overall I believe a cooperative approach is going to produce a superior outcome over a competitive approach.  The results will be more solid and less likely to have had any shortcuts taken in order to beat an opponent.  I think the feel of victory is better as it is a team effort.
