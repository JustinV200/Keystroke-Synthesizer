     Over the course of time since the beginning of recorded history (and probably before that) , humans have had posessions.  Looking at cave drawings and pictographs, one can see there was ownership of things, even if those things were simply natural items like rocks, stick, and animals.  Then people began making things like cooking tools and weapons, and those were essential possessions.  Modern humans can only imagine what those times were like because of the advance and incredible possessions we have today.  
    Is it bad to have things?  I do not believe that it is.  Sure, we (the collective human race) can be very possessive of our material possessions.  We can start wars over stuff like oil and land, but for some of us the things we have give us meaning.  Victor Frankle describes needing to make our own meaning in his book "Man's Search for Meaning".  And while his experience suffering through the tradgedy of the Holocaust is vastly different from the average basic middle-class person, we all have to find meaning where we can.  This is not a good comparison, but it makes sense to me. 
    Sometimes, meaning in our lives comes from the things we have.  Most people have hobbies and enjoy having material items.  Some people buy things, collect them, are given them as gifts.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  Sure we have limited resources on earth, and that should be taken into account when consuming and collecting things, but on the other hand, if that is the only place a person can find happiness, why not?
   Some of us are lonely.  Some of us have no family.  Some of us count our closet full of shoes as more important than a friend, and who cares?  There are billions of people in this world and we are all so different.  We should not judge a person on what brings them happiness, unless it is hurting another person.
