Modern society has been so materialistic that it has changed our youth forever, which is why modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. 

Let's take a quick look at any social media platform like Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, or TikTok.
Any video you watch, any influencer you see is promoting a certain item or "can't live without" a certain something they point out in their content.  It's all about what you have, how much you spent, what the box looked like, what the product does for you and others around you; our kids are now hard wired to associate self worth with materialistic items.

Unboxing videos have a huge following on social media.  This influencers buy products, mostly through companies who sponsor them, and make a video about opening the contents of these items.  I remember when my child used to love unboxing videos of toys and products I couldn't afford.  It was one of the hardest times of my life.  These videos trigger chemicals in our brains; pleasure.  Our young children are exposed to this.  This allows them to believe that the materialistic things you own and have make your worth.

Modern society has turned everything into ads, some about material items, some not.  The problem we face is that these ads, this society or modern materialism, is changing our children who will be leading our world one day.  We should be more cautious as to what they learn as important and truly fulfilling in this world.  They will be the future leaders of this world. This is why modern society should be critizied for being materialistic.
