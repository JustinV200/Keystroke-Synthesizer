Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? It is a great questions. In my opinion, they definitely do. To get the consumers' attention, companies have to make sure the packaging is attractive or else, it would never be given a chance to be purchased. The same can be said for public figure and politicians. That's why images and impressions have too much effect on people.
 
When we meet someone for the first time, we need to look good. The old saying, "The first impression is very important." Why is that? Without a good first impression, people won't take notice of you. It is vital for people to remember you. Or else, they will forget you very quickly. That's why companies emphasize beautiful packaging for their products. Without the great first impression, the consumers would never take notice. There are so many products on the shelves that it is very important to stand out. Often time, the products may not be as advertised, but with a fancy packaging, they will be given a chance to be bought. Same with politicians and public figures. Their "appearance" is way more important than their abilities. Without their fancy appearances, the public will never notice them, because there are too many politicians out there. Appearances are vital in our society.

Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Most definitely. They are vital in our society. Without fancy packaging and appearances, no one will ever take notice of them. They will never be given a chance. What we think we see becomes excessively more important than what really is. That's why all the famous influencers need to package themselves to be attractive to the public, so they can get people to subscribe to their channels and view their contents. Therefore, it is concluded that images and impressions do have too much of an effect on people.
