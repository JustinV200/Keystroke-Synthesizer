     Happiness is a feeling and a state of being. People will go through great lengths and even do evil things, to find happiness. It is in our human nature to seek out this state of being, as it allows us to feel fulfilled and ultimately satisfied with our lives. Sadly some never attain overall happiness in their lives, in part because they focus too much on others. 
     
     Certain people derive happiness from altruistic endevours, doing and giving to others. Some people find happiness by pursuing personal goals and passions. The latter group, that seeks to find happiness by focusing on personal goals, is usually more successful in finding it. 
     
     Happiness is a state that is created. You have to activley choose to be happy and work towards that goal. If you can not make yourself happy, how will you be able to help others? It is like the airplane emergency mask. You are instructed to place the mask on yourself first, then help your neighbor. By focusing on personal growth and goals, you become a better person overall. This allows you to help others, through example and by association. Also others are more likely to let you down or break a promise. You on the other hand, can be true to yourself. 
     
     Yes helping others makes us feel good. It is the right thing to do and you will be seen as a hero. For a moment put yourself in this situation: Imagine you were a rich person, suffering from depression with a failing personal life. You could do everything in your power to help others, but happiness will evade you. The fact that you couldn't find happiness within yourself, holds you back from being truly happy. 
    
 People should strive to do good for humanity, but first take care of themselves. Aiming at something other than your own happiness is noble, however if your goals and dreams are not being fulfilled, you will not be happy.
