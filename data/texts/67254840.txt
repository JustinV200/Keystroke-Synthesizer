Here according to me cooperation is the only way to achieve success, in this competion world we cannot get success using ourself, we need some cooperation while working with others. No one can get top in a day, at first we shoul develop ourself in a particular field and get experienced, for getting in a field we should cowork with others there may be many struggles and misunderstandings in our basic starting point of work, there may be many ups and downs.
We need people to guide us in initial stage to learn new things, to solve our doubts, to solve our questions, to mark and give solutions for our mistakes.When we work with people in a cooperative way we can have healthy and good competition, we can get many ideas and suggestions. Without teamwork we can't work in a particular field and company, we should give respect and consider other peoples thoughts too their ideas may also help us to get success.
Cooperation is found everywhere, between two countries, companies eventhough our body needs cooperation, In case if we take our body and organs, what will be their goal?  help us to maintain homeostatis, if we take our heart what will happen if it think to competete with others heart and beats more than 72? or what will happen without coopeartion of all oragns can we humans exist? 
For example, cooperation of ants, cooperation of bees can make success.
cooperation and competetion both are important, but in our pratical life we can overcome this competition world through cooperation.
