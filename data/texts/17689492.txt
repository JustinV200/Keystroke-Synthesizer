Have you ever walked into a store and just bought something by the way it looks or how it makes us feel? What we see in our lives has an adverse affect on us. We see a blue packaging and identify it as our favorite color or see a tiger and want to buy a certain brand. The way images impressions can have an affect is through polictical, groccery shopping, or just any form of consumer goods but do they really hold any meaning or significance. Just because of the promotion do they hold any value. 
First we might think to ourselves when we go groccery shopping that we won't be influenced by a product's design but we are wrong. We subconciously look at color or a  character on a package and want to buy it because we like the looks of it. We could also go into a store hungry and be more affected by the smells and sights of different foods in a supermarket but not buy what we need because we were affected by our hunger. We could buy a food product because a celebrity endorsed it but doesn't speak for its quality. 
Second when we see polictical adversaries in a debate we form impressions within the first few minutes. Just by there stance, the way they talk and if they sweat. Not only what they say matters but how they present themselves. Confidence along with knowledge on key issues wins. But sometimes we are let down by confidence alone. We could vote for the wrong canidate because of this. We could see this in the first live tv presidential debate featuring Nixion vs Keneddy.
Lastly when we buy other consumer goods like cars or trucks. We look at it's looks before it's design or features. We might want more curves in a car but not realize it doesn't have traction control just as an example. Another example could be you bought car because it was endorsed by a celebrity but it turns out the car got poor gas milege.  There was a truck in the 60s from my memory that was a dodge truck called the dude that don knotts endorsed.
