
 Happiness, where does it come from? Does it birth from self care or does it come from communication with and helping others? There are different ways a person can look at happiness and how to achieve it.  Personally, I think that it is a very individual decision and one should reflect on their own individualistic values in order to really find where their  happiness comes from. Personally, I think that one can find the true happiness within the self.  

  It has been a long term belief of mine that in order to be truly happy, a person must be happy within themselves.  Yes, they may have a bad day once in awhile but the core belief system is that they are fufilled and enjoy  who they are.  They are the dreamers and work towards a world that is enjoyable.  This life is one where expectations are met and the person has growth. 

  One may argue that making other people happy is the best way to live a satisfied and plesant life. I tend to disagree.  A person may be giving of themselves which in turn makes others pleased, but at what cost? What is the person giving up to be a people pleaser? Sadlly, often themselves which leads to a host of other behavior issues. 

  At the basic core is this fact. A person can not love, or find happiness, or truly enjoy life until they have truly found hapiness within themselves.  A person simply has to do the work required to search and find inside the  most important of feelings, happiness.
