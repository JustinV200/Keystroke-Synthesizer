Many people in many different societies around the world criticize (the western countries predominantly) for being to materialistic; but is this an objectively fair criticism? Yes...and no.

It is very true that those of us in the west spend an inordinate amount of time chasing the next best "thing", be that furniture, cars, tools and very recently, technology.  Like most things in Life, that is a double-edged sword. 

On the one hand, each purchase is providing jobs to multiple people and families in the supply chain from manufacturing and design to shipping, packaging and sales that then allows them to provide for their own households and chase *their* idea of the next best thing.

On the other hand, a successful and rewarding life requires balance.  It is not good to obsess over any hobby or goal to the exclusion of other equally or more important things.  At varying points in time a thing will rise to prominence - for example, the purchase of a new washing machine because yours just failed, or a family member with a catastrophic illness that puts, or should put, pursuit of all other goals on the back burner.

The Bible is full of wisdom, whether one is of that faith or not.  One of the wisest things found there is: "Moderation in all things".  More people need to remember this. 

Materialism, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but will become what you make of it.  So much of Life is like that. Take care that you aren't making it your supreme interest all the time.  In fifty years you are unlikely to remember the the nth version of Amazon Echo you *just had to have*, but you will remember the experiences you shared with your grandmother while she was alive.  

In conclusion, any obsession is bad, and too many in our society are obsessed with acquisition, but the acquiring of things itself is not bad. It is obsession that is bad, no matter what form that obsession takes.
