When the idea of happiness comes to mind, it goes beyond personal goals or depending on the happiness of others. Sure, those things could induce the emotions of happiness, but those feelings are usually fleeting, and doesn't bring a true sense of fulfillment. I feel that true happiness come from within--an internal source of self-acceptance, self-love and self-actualization. When people focus on outside achievements and happiness of others, they will likely feel unfulfilled.

When I was younger, I bought into the idea that as long as I did everything right, made a lot of money, completed my goals successfully, that somehow it would bring happiness into my life. Well, I did those things and soon found out that it didn't fully make me happy. Yes, money does help make life a little easier, but when it came to things that mattered, it didn't bring a sense of fulfillment. What I come to realize is that none of those things gave me what I chereshed most. Love. 

Some may argue that money is the answer to everything, but there's a plethora of news stories on wealthy individuals who are miserable. Even those with the most acheivements and awards may find themselves feeling a sense of emptiness because all the achievements in the world isn't going to make them love themselves.

When I finally started doing the internal work on myself to heal old wounds and traumas, face fears, forgive myself, and love myself as-is, I found that life was getting brighter in a new way. Unlike any other goal, a road to self-love and acceptance is an ongoing job throughout life. When I know that I love who I am no matter what, I'm simply happy. If more people focus on their own internal source of self-love and acceptance, they will likely be happy as well.
