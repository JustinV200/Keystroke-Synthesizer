It is difficult to bring joy and happiness to others when we don't feel it within ourselves. Similar to an airplane emergency when adults putting their masks on first before helping a child, humans also need to take care of themselves first, before they can truly gain happiness from helping others. While helping others might bring us some hapiness, there is also the chance that it will also bring us guilt and resentment if our needs are not being met. True happiness comes from settings goals for ourselves and taking the steps we need to to achieve them.

If a personal goal is to help others, then bringing hapiness to other will be a win-win situation! A person would feel happiness in accomplishing their goal and bringing happiness to others. If a person has an ivdividual goal, perhaps to buy a home, they can enjoy the journey and the reward that comes with buying a home. They can then share that joy and happiness by inviting those they care about to their home and spending time with them. If they are have to choose between pursuing their own goal and making others happy, then bringing hapiness to others while failing at their own goal will only result in a loss of hapiness for the person.

In order to improve humanity and bring happiness to others, we must first bring happiness to ourselves. Sometimes bringing hapiness to others will make us happy if that happens to be our goal, but spreading happiness is only possible when we have it within us to share. We can find that happiness by pursing our personal goals and finding happiness on the way to our goal.
