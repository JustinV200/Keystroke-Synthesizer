Most of the people will achieve their goals by competition. I have lot of competition in my organization to get success in my project. I would like to become a good position in my carreer so I have work hard to get success. I am working as supervisor in my healthcare industry. I have maintain 20 peoples everyday. I will give clear instructions to everyone's schedule. As per scheduled, our employees will work. So we have to work hard to achieve their goals by cooperation. 
Day by day I am working hard to achieve my goal. I will strictly follows my manager order and I will complete my project on time and my team members will be work hard to get success rate. Every month end I will have an competition to show our team member success rate. Based on the score, We will win the competition. My team member will provide full support to achieve my goals. My higher officials also providing me full support to learn new things. 
Sure, I will achieve more success by competition. I will show my skills to higher officials and get success for my efforts. I would like to share about my family. My spouse and family members will give full support to get sucess of my goals. Sometimes, its getting very late to finish my work but my spouse will give company till my work get finish. Thank you for this opportunity to share my thought about success.
