The issue, whether happiness comes by pursing their determine dreams and own individual thoughts or not, is certainly a contentious one. This issue has always been debatable but the substential influence of the matter has aparked tremendously in the recent years in view of the changing standard of life. This essay will discuss both the views of the matter and thus will lead to its logical conclusion. 
On the one hand, the proponents of happines come by pursuing their dreams and by their own goal say that if we enjoy our life we have to achieve by our own dreams. When we see a dream its come true one day. We work hard to accomplished our goal to become more comfort in our lives. Its not hit and trial rule to acheive this. Many examples in our surronding. Like the ordinary people only think that gaol belongs to thir happiness in life. Most people in worldwide have these thinking in their minds. They donot bother about the society and people around them.
On the other hand the opponents of this they realize that the goal is important over their happines. Its  plays a vital role to acheive aim. For instant, the founder of pakistan Mr. Quiad-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah has a dream to an independence country. He worked hard to acheive his goal and he succeed to make a separate county "Pakistan". He only focused his goal over the happines of his life. World always rember their efforts what they do for their community and people.
Whereas, if the veracity of the foregoing discussion is looked into minutely and the both views are placed just a position it would be crystal clear that the aim is important in multiplicity than the happines comes by own dream.
In conclusion, in view of what, discussed above i feel no hesitation to vehemently support my view that people are happy only when they have their mind fixed on some goal other than their own happiness.
