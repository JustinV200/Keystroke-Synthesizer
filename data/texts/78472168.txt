     In todays world I think that images and impressions have a very large effect on people. People rely and view things that others do and feel like they have to compete with them. I think in stores and even online when a product looks good and the advertising is good, a person is going to be more drawn to it. When a person is on tv and they are saying things that other people may want to hear, then more people are going to want to go along with that person despite what they really might be like and believe in. 

     The way things look in person or even on tv is never how it really is in real life. For instance, women who are on television or in magazines always have makeup on and look different than they would if they were just moving around their house. Things arent necessarily what they seem and that goes for all sorts of things in the world. Images and impressions have a very large effect on others cause when people see things or other people that catch their eye, that is what their main focus then goes to no matter what the actual situation is at that time.

     Overall I think that what you see isnt always what you get. If you rely on looks and the impressions you get at first with anything in life you may be setting yourself up for dissapointment later on. You should always try to see the broader spectrum of things so that you arent upset about the true outcome. Keeping an open mind is always the right way to look at things in life and remember that you also wont always have the same effect on everyone. People should have their own opinions and views.
