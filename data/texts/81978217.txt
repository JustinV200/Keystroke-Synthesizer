    When working towards your goals, or even wanting to achieve your own sort of success, then cooperation is the only way to achieve these goals. Being able to work together towards one goal will allow you to complete these goals much faster than if you were doing it alone and you will have a broad range of mindsets that can contribute many different things when working towards your success.
    In my experience I have found that when working alone, achieving any sort of goal becomes long and tedious, and sometimes you can become unorganized. However when working with a team there are a lot of people who will be able to contribute towards a goal, and be able to complete tasks much faster, due to the fact that you can appoint certain people to certain areas, instead of just having one person do everything.
    While some people believe that you have to be competitive towards others in order to achieve your goals, I believe this is false, as having only one person's ideas will be counterproductive when working towards your goals, because you will have only one person's ideas and midsets when it comes to topics. Cooperating with other people will give more brain power, or have more ideas and different aspects on things when it comes to accomplishing tasks or achieving your goals.
    In conclusion, make sure to keep in mind that there are a lot of different mindsets out there that could be very beneficial towards your goals, and will help you achieve great success. You want to make sure that you are accounting for every single detail that maybe you personally have not heard of, but someone else has heard of. Do not be clouded by other people and how fast they are gaining success, as you will have a team that you can work with to actively achieve your goal of success.
