I think that images and impressions defintely have too much of an effect on people. Social media platforms, especially Instagram, are the biggest contributor to this problem. It's hard to know what's real and what's not.

Here's an example: on Instagram a person or "influencer" is paid money to promote a product. Sometimes a lot of money. If someone is a fan of that influencer they would probably buy the product just because they like the person promoting it. Most of the time I think they probably don't even use the product.

Another area where images and impressions have too much of an effect on our reality is the overuse of filters. Almost every celebrity or public figure out there changes their appearance with filters to make themselves look thinner or younger. When ordinary people see someone they respect looking so much better than they do it can be depressing for them. They're holding themselves up to an image or impression that's not even real.

And it happens to almost everybody . I can tell myself that what I'm seeing is an illusion, that the person doesn't really look like that or a product doesn't really work that good but I still find myself getting sucked in by it. I want to believe it, even if I know deep down it's probably not real.

You can tell yourself looks are deceiving, but when you're bombarded with all these ads and influencers telling you what to do and what to wear and what gadgets to buy it's sometimes hard to remember that. I feel sorry for the kids growing up today because it's in their face every day when they use social media or watch TV. 

I think some of these celebrities and some of these influencers need to start a trend of being themselves and presenting an image that isn't real. I've seen some that have, and it's a step in the right direction, but we have a long way to go before it's the norm. And I'm not really sure we'll ever get there. We may just need to learn to look past the facade and see what's really real.
