   The wonderful question of do you achieve more success by competition or cooperation. People seem to go back and forth on this but I persoanlly am standing strong at one answer. I beleive that compeition helps us achive more sucess. when there is competition you push yourself harder and harder. You strive to do the best you possibly can. You also cherish you accomplishments more due to the hard work you put in. 
     Think of it in this way, kids these days  everyone wins a trophy. they wont push themself because in their mind they are winning something. there is no need to go above and beyond because what is the point. Now when i was a child you had to work hard in order to get a trophy. i remeber waking up early putting in the work and still not getting a award or trophy but that pushed me even harder. Not only did it teach me hard work but also how to handle disapointment.
     Even in adult work you can think of it in a commission aspect. those employees work extreamly hard because if they dont they wont get paid nearly as much and they compete againt each other in order to get those sales. Cooperation in my opnion teaches people to be middle of the road or below par becuase you can depend on others to do it or help you. where competition you strive to be the best you can be. if you want the best from workers or students even if a small competetion hold one and you will see productivity increase. cooperation is not going to ruin anything but if you want stronger individuals then competition is the way to go.
