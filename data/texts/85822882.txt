When it comes to competition everyone will look for success. Whether it is one to one competion or a bunch of teams together. Their main motto is to win. So I think it is no matter whether in cooperation or in competition, their main set of goal must be in winning the competition. 

Everything is an experience. We cannot stick with the same idea even it lead us to succes for some time. We need to gain everything from everyone. If we are so fond of  working alone and winning alone, it is good. But we never know the feel of working with others and cherishing that victory with others who given their 100 percent to the team. So we need to try everything at any cost. There was a time in  college days. 

I used to work alone, study alone. But I am comfortable with that. Then there was a time where I need to work on with my team for my final year projects. At first I got anxious and hesitant. But once I started to work with them I found pleasure and it was completely new experience for me. Then I understood the power of working as team. And we won that competition.

My mom used to say that when she was working in her working days she was so much anxious and nervous on working with team. She thought that somone will blame her for no reason and she worked alone. But just like me she too had a situation as working with team. Then she ended up with a good team. They took care of her and she was so happy to work with them. Thats where her journey begins.

But at end of the day it is up to the individual on how and when to work and stuffs like that. we must not insist and compel others on things said above. Because there are no proper ways to do things. There was a say like a pack of wolves will hunt down lion at ease. and another was like no pack of wolves will match the intelligence of lion. So there is no right or wrong. 

So we can conclude that everything is good and bad according to the individual.
