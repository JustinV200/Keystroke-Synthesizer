Most of the peoples are feeling happy by doing their own achievements like Graduation, Good job and Well-settled life. But, some of the peoples realize their happiness by helping other peoples. I have one friend named Mike, He is an excellent character who always help for others and satisfy by others happy moments. 
He is always care about stray animals like cat, dog and hamsters. One day I went with him for a little walk. As soon as he saw a stray cat beside the pathway, he just stop and went to it. Then he took it in his hands and came to his house. After that, he given bath to that stray cat and given a good canned cat food for it.
On that time I realize that some of the peoples are getting their happiness by helping someones who really needs help and shelter. After that incident, I saw one stray puppy nearby one dustbin on the pathway. I took him to my home to take care of that puppy. I have given a food for it and given the bath to clean it's fleas in it's body. After that I took care of the puppy and feeling very much joyful afterwards. So, every person who can able to help others, then do that and fulfill your happiness besides completing own achivements.
