  Does focusing on the happiness of other people rather than your own lead to increased personal happiness? I tend to believe so, simply because of the fact that helping others leads to a deeper sense of satisfaction and purpose that focusing on your own happiness just can't provide. Sure, you might feel good when you achieve that personal goal of getting a better education, or when you get a raise at your job. But how deep is that happiness, and what other purpose does it serve other than to make you happy?
  There is a reason that many people volunteer and help others. It's not just about putting another bullet point on your resume, and it's not about making yourself look good in the eyes of others. For some, it's connected to one's faith and beliefs, which leads to an even deeper and more meaningful sense of purpose. For others, they feel it's important to give back, especially when they consider how much they've been given. Some were raised to think of others first, and selflessness has been ingrained into them. 
  Whatever the reason, helping others and focusing on their happiness and goals would not only serve to give meaning to your life, but in seeking these things, it could very well lead to increasing your own happiness, too. Love and charity have a ripple effect that touches everyone involved. Of course, that's not the reason to seek these qualities out - it's just a byproduct of doing so. Altruism is a trait that many seek to have, and for good reason. Knowing that you're selfless and dedicated to helping others helps you feel a sense of meaning and purpose in the world, which in the end, increases the happiness of those you reach out to, and in the end, goes full circle back to you.
