There are two different beliefs on happiness. Some believe happiness comes from within, while others believe happiness comes from the outside, more specifically, the happiness of others. It is in my opinion that people are more likley to be happy if they focus on their personal goals and not the happiness of others. 

I find it difficult to make other people around me happy when I am not happy myself. If I am in a bad mood or feeling down about a situation, the people around me can sense or pick up on my mood. It would be exhausting constantly worrying about others if I was not caring for myself. Personally, I spent quite a few years being a depressed and miserable people-pleaser and in the long run it did not benefit me or anyone else.  I did not have the energy to help others to ensure their happiness when I was not feeling my best self.

In conclusion, I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals versus the happiness of others. I think this opens the opportunity to be able to help others once we are happy with ourselves and living fufilling lives. At the end of the day, the person you have to feel most comfortable and happy with is yourself.
