There are different opinions on how people pursue their happiness. Some think that happiness comes from pursuing their dreams, while others think that happiness comes from focusing on the happiness of others. I believe that happiness comes from focusing on our personal goals.

To begin with, humans are selfish beings that focus on themselves first before taking care of other people. A good analogy is the requirement to use our own breathing apparatus before helping our kids with their breathing apparatus during an emergency on the plane. When one has fulfilled their own needs, then they can start thinking about other people. It is difficult to take care of other people when you still have problems with yourself.

Additionally, focusing on other people's happiness is actually just another way for people to be happy. For example, some people can only be happy when other people are happy. Therefore, making other people happy is actually one's personal goal. It's just different means to an end. People are not making other people happy just for the sake of other people. Rather, they make other people happy because it is their personal goal to do so.

Therefore, happiness comes by pursing one's dreams and personal goals instead of focusing on some goal other than their own happiness. A person cannot be happy if they do not focus on themselves first because people are inherently selfish. Also, there is no way people can think of other people's happiness if their mind is occupied with their own problems.
