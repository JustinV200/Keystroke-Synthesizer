When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?


As you are today, are you living out your childhood dream? If you are, I envy you. If you are not, I stand with you. Often times, childhood dream jobs were chosen based on our role models and that which inspired us at the time. For instance, becoming a firefighter, a teacher, a doctor, or a scientist, to name a few. However, as you grow up, you realize how unattainable pursuing your goals and dreams are. Finances, resources, time, and life's circumstances stand in the way. The majority of us are unable to pursue our dreams and achieve our personal goals until retirement - if we do. 

As you are today, if you are not living our your childhood dream, I stand with you. I work in corporate America where individuals focus on the happiness of others. Specifically, employees worry about impressing and keeping their boss happy for fear of being fired and unemployed. While corporate America is a relatively safe space with stability, often time, free time to dream and rest over the weekend turn into working over-time. 

As I am today, I an unhappy. Do I make more money than I ever thought possible? Yes. Am I able to support myself comfortably? Yes. But am I happy? No. I do not find the work I do particularly meaningful or exciting. I feel as if each day I am living for the sake of living. I often dream about leaving it all behind and pursuing my passions, but I fear society. I fear my parents and their scoffs. I fear myself and my fear of failure. So yes, you can pursue your dreams, but it comes with a cost. If you do not pursue your dreams, you can be happy in a superficial sense where everyone around you may think you are happy, but you will never achieve happiness. 

All in all, happiness is a subjective, individual experience that we only know for ourselves. All I know is that chasing after your dreams is better than all the money and all other things you could gain. Go chase. Be a kid.
