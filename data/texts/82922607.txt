                                              SUCCESS OF COOPERATION AND COMPETITIONS

        Cooperation is more important. Human societies have always lived with cooperation through the hunter gatherer phase.but both are qually important some cases.competition generally involoves cooperation such as obeying the law or rules of engagement.Ruthless competition can often be harmful and should be avioded.Many companies compete in some aspects and cooperate in others.

      Coopertions without competition is possible.Imagine a family of adults living and working in isolation.Their coopertion makes their lives much better than it wouldbe if they all lived alone.One person working alone can hunt and manage a garden .A cooperting family can also farm.Trade is a form of coopertions.Division of labor and specialization is an advanced form of cooperation.it wouldn't help for example for one person to only raise grain and another to only bake if they didn't trade.
       
      Business is about cooperation and competition.form a personal  it is almost entirely cooperation and comnpetition.You need everyone working with you in order to be as effective as possible.The company competes which requires everyone in the company working together. This also includes working with partner companies.Everyone needs to be working together in order for the company to be competing in the market.they work together as a team often enough they are symbiotic not opposites and certainly not by any necessity antagonistically.Competition  is the life of commerce cooperation the soul of it.
