We as humans rely too much on our sights for judging things, which is not wrong, that's why we have eyes. But it is wrong to believe everything we see without a doubt. It is a thing that most of the modern companies are monitizing on. By fooling us, by exploiting our nature of being attracted by colorful things.

Images and impressions have far too much impact on our decision making capabilities. Especially with clever marketing and colorful packaging. Things like these pulls us away from the reality of the product. All of these things are done by the advertisement industries, infact the sole reason for why the advertisement industry exists is to fool people into buying products, by showing colorful images, by creating favorable impressions, by paying celebrities and other important people to say something good about the product. We believe celebrities to be this "perfect" being, a being which knows all that is good, a being who posseses all kinds of knowledge of all kinds of things; for which we jump to buy a product when it is being endorsed by a celebrity, forgetting the fact that they are too are human like us.

If we want to truely decide if something is good or not we need to judge it with our own two eyes without being biased, we need to see that if it really is the thing that it is being said by the sellers and advertisers. Only then we would be able to make proper use of these eyes we were given.
