The assertation that materialism - "aquiring possesions and spending money - is a vital source of meaning and happiness in our time" is one of the foundational crisises of the modern age. Posessions and their acquisition are instead a sad subsitute for human connection. Modern society needs to take a step back and think about what we've given up in order to have things. 

Materialism is more than just the fact that we require goods and services to live. It is the elevation of those goods and services above the relationships with human beings that is the problem. Where we should be looking very, very closely is in whether we have placed things above living, breathing, people. I would argue that in a world where a teenager can lose their life over a pair of shoes that we have crossed the Rubicon on that one. 

Modern society ha gotten more and more status driven - and we use retail goods to advertise our status instead of getting to know each other. And while a few cultural signaling items aren't automatically bad, we are far past "a little bit of flair" as a culture. People use the outward material indicators of status as a replacement for worth. It's unfortunate and a side effect of late stage capitalism and it's corruption of human behaviour. 

Materialism drives us to compete instead of collaborate. We should absolutely be criticized for valuing phones over the connections that those phones can maintain. Material objects are only worth what they add to actual human life - instead we are willing to sacrifice human life for objects. The urgency to consume is overwhelming - and leaves us little room for anything else.
