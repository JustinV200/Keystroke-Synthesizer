      A dear friend of mine told me "The more stuff we aquire, just leaves more work for our loved ones to sift through after we die." That sentence has stuck with me ever since. Now, obviously, we kind of need to have stuff...right? I mean, we all need clothes, and some of us need cars in order to get back and forth to work. Do we really need to be so obsessed with our stuff? I think there should be a healthy balance between buying what we need and what we want.
    Last year, I needed to buy a car. I saved my money, and waited until the right opportunity came. I purchased a used car from a friend, for 3,000.00. It's not the prettiest, or fanciest car, but it has a solid engine and runs great, with really low mileage. If everyone made decisions with their purchases based on their needs instead of the worlds flashy expectations, not only would it benefit our pockets but would also benefit the environment. 
    There is nothing wrong with spending money. It is something that everyone has to do. I do think that modern society focuses too much of their time and money on things that do not matter. Do people really need to have 50 pairs of fancy shoes that they never wear? Do people need to have giant mansions? No, people do not need these things. People can be so focused on the wrong things in life, never realizing those things that really matter are fleeting and passing them by. I don't think people should be criticized for being materialistic, but they may need to be reminded about the things that really matter in life. 
    In the end, the things that really matter are not our material posessions. The things we aquire in our life cannot be taken with us when we die. I think it is important to focus our time and money on things that matter, like our family and the people we love.
