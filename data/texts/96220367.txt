we alla re humans who live in a highly competitive world we see everything as a competition so we make everything a competitive way to win. we all need to acquire a certain fame and achievements to win that we compete in a wide area of various competitions but these compitions make us forget the team work that can make us win in various areas and in a large scale with great productivity. 
team work keeps tha work alive when some are not currently available it male the work going completely fine without any problems but whne we stand alone if we are un well the whole work stops abruptly it breaks the productivity highly amd can make us loss confidence.
being competitive is not that bad but we must not be jealous and must be carried away from being us.
we must remember who we are and lets start team work that is highly effective in all ways. 
the difference in being competitive and doing team work is highly variable like when we think of a war we take the army in count not the strongest one one strong man can be defeated by a good team of five with great co operation.
we must do team work for the hard jobs.
by doing a work as a team we can have multiple works completed simultaneously.
