 Some people will find happiness by focusing on goals. Focusing on goals are important because you set standards of where your life should be lead at. Whether its a career goal or a personal goal. The more faith and focus you have on a goal the more success you'll expierence. Whenever I have goals and I met a few. I notice it helps with my mental health. Most of the goals I set for myself are very important to what revolves around my life. A goal I recently achieved was going to college for graphic design. I became happy to know I'm close to working on the career I want. If anyone pushes themselves to a goal it helps keeping up with how they feel. Having goals is like having a plan you want to persue. One may find themselves even making notes of all goals and check them off once met. 

 In conclusion, those are some of my reasonings in why someone would be happy towards goals. It takes courage to follow goals and dreams. Sometimes even looking at a goal can be looked as a daily routine. Happiness helps with believing in yourself.
