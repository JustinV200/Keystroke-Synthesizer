Images and impressions have far too much of an effect on people. All around us, we see images and take impressions where we process them in our brains. We look at celebrities and want the products they have just so we can be just like them. I remember when tabloid magazines were very popular in the 2000s. 

Celebrities like Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan would travel in packs all over Los Angeles and shop at a store named Kitson, the paparazzi would photo them and the store Kitson would run out of products. 
The Kardashians are another example, the product they sell is glamour, they are obsessed with looking nice and having amazing bodies. 

On the other hand, who am I to judge when it comes to the topics of what makes people happy. I understand that what we see could become far more important than it really is, but who am I to tell someone what they admire is not important. Just because I dont care that Kylie Jenner got more lip injections doesnt someone else shouldn't care. We want to be favorable, we want to be accepted, we feel like these trends will help us become a part of society.

Some people need impressions to be put on them, not eerything has to be negative. There are such things as good impressions, it sucks that we have to fous on the bad impressions.
