The definition of happiness can mean something different between individuals but a constant remains, happiness means one is truely content with where they are at in their current moment in life. Whether a dictator has completed their goal of ruling the country they've sought after for years to come or child finally got the toy they've been asking for christmas hapiness can range vastly different between individuals. People's happiness depends on the person they are which leads to whether they will be happy for their own personal goals or the happiness of others.
