When I think about the word happiness, I think of my children. My personal happinness is mostly projected through them. I think most people are happier when the ones they love are around them. 

 I do know though, some are happier alone. That is ok. I think it just depends on who you are. Everyone is diffrent. 

I personally would not be happy if I didnt have anyone around me to care for first. That is just the way I am wired.
It also depends on the situation, for example : losing wieght or eating heathly. Those things would most likey only benefit me personally, and not anyone else. I would feel a happiness that would come from losing weight. 

To make others happy an example for me would be: baking a cake / planning a trip for the family. That alone with satisfying me but also would make my family happy.

Another example that could make ones self happy plus othesr would be donating/volunteering. Helping your community does benefit alot of people. The self satifation and happiness that can come from doing these things for the world, could be legendary.    

In conclusion I think it all depends on if you are an introvert or extrovert. That would be a determining factor in which would make you a selfish individual or a giver. Which ever kind of person you are, happiness can be achived.

Happiness is only started from within, you have to be the one to take action to get the results you are looking for.
