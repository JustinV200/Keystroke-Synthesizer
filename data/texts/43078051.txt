The prompt poses a very intellectual question, where many people sit and have to ask ourselves; "Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals, or on the happiness of others". This shows up in all of our lives, in one way or another. Society has led most individuals to believe that success equals self contentment. But what is success? How do we measure success?

For example, when I was 21, I met my boyfriend and fell in love. Before I met him, I was quite lonely. I was a professional dancer, and I never felt valued. I was constantly chasing the stardom and the bright lights. It wasn't long into my career that the light started to burnout. About a month before I met him, I decided that I was no longer going to be unhappy, and that I wanted to use all of that underutilized energy to make a difference in the world. 

This new mindest prompted me to take on a new volunteer role at a children's hospital, and I quickly grew to appreciate the small things in life. It occured to me that when you can make someone smile, it fills your cup in ways that you didn't know were necessary. The result was that I became happier in knowing that I could make a small difference. It comes as no surprise to me that I fell in love shortly thereafter, because my heart was in wide receiving. Not once did my personal goals of what I thought would make me happy before, even cross my mind. I found happiness along the way. 

In conclusion, my stance on this subject is that while many people claim that a particular goal or outcome is the key to happiness, I beg to differ. My goal was never to make someone smile, however, I found complete solace in knowing that I could achieve this, and things fell into place organically with my new relationship. Personal fulfillment and happiness is the product of making others feel such a way.
