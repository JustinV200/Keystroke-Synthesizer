Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.  Acknowledging that material items do not create happiness will actually create a happier environment.  Learning how to counter materialistic mindsets will aid with changing the societal views of tangible items versus interpersonal and spiritual wellness.

Human beings enter the world with no assets.  As we grow into childhood and early adulthood, it seems materialism becomes how we determine success versus failure.  If someone has more, they must be successful.  If someone has better, more expensive items, they must be more successful.  It would make life easier and more rewarding to end this thought process because it does not create internal happiness.  Everyone dies and we cannot take possessions with us.  We can, however, take our spiritual growth into the next life.

But if I can afford things that I desire, doesn't that give me happiness?  Most people do get a sense of happiness when they purchase items that they want.  It is rewarding to be able to afford things that we desire.  Does that reward counter the need for spiritual or emotional happiness?  Life can be easier when we have the funds to live a comfortable life and some believe that creates happiness.  Is that happiness or decreased stress?

Possessions are temporary and they will come and go.  The internal growth that we area able to make by utilizing our energy to have relationships and not focus on possessions will be much greater.  People will forget things that you had but not who you were.
