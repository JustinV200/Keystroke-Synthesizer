How can a person truley be happy if he or she focuses solely on others? To find  happiness, an individual should first consider their own goals and dreams before focusing on the dreams of others.

While a desire for the betterment of others is a noble sentiment, and is something we should all endeavor toward in our lives, we can not focus on others to the exclusion or detriment of our own happiness. If a person is miserable in their daily life, how can they find true happiness in helping others to achieve their goals? Improving the lives of others can certainly be a goal, but is probably better achieved after a person sees to their own wellbeing. 

Many may argue that they find significant satisfaction in helping those less fortunate or disadvantaged, whether local to them, on a national level, or covering humanity as a whole. While I applaud this sense of duty and charity toward others, and agree that it is a noble goal, this approach is not effective if a person has little or nothing to give, or has no time or energy due to their own circumstances. 

The focus should be on yourself before attempting to tackle external issues.  By all means, the desire to help others is an important step in our own happiness, but it should not be our primary focus.
