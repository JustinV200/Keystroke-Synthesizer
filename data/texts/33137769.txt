     Working together, as opposed to competing with each other, while working towards a goal will always achieve more success. There is even a higher probability to achieve success when cooperating with others because the act of working together is motivation in itself.  Competing against each other will most likely lead to inflated egos that can be a detriment to the project or goal.
     If you have a group of like-minded individuals with a similar skill set working together towards a goal, you will likely see a powerful level of commitment and dedication towards each other and the goal. If it's a team who have previously worked together before and can work seamlessly together, the benefits would be exponential.  Money as a reward could be used as a motivation tool as well if they were given a time sensitive goal to complete thier tasks.
     A negative side of working cooperatively is if the team doesn't work well with others or if their skill levels are mismatched.  One person pulling the team will surely create resentment that wouldn't be there in a different more evenly keeled team.  This, however, doesn't have to be all negative.  If you have someone in the team who can lead and delegate tasks and can see the skill levels of the other teammates, success can still be achieved with cooperative groups.  A team needs someone to step up and lead. 
     The power of cooperation comes from good leadership.  A bad team, who are working together towards a goal will pull ahead of a team working against each other if they have good leadership.  The team will feel accomplished in their tasks and feel more of a sense of worth lives outside of work.  Working together will always be easier to achieve.  Success will follow.
