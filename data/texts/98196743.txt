Seeing is believing or at least that is what one use to think. It might not be so easy to detect what is real and what is merely a dressed up or sanitized version of one's life.  This sanitized version of living is what appears in social media. 

It might start with a funny little filter where a dog is wearing a cowboy hat and sunglasses; this is super cute, and it is not damaging anyone's perception of reality. But what if someone posted pictures of him or herself in front of the Space Needle in Seattle? Can we trust that this was real? The answer is no because of the use of apps. Nobody is going to be hurt or damaged in the above scenarios, but they might with politicians and extremists who are trying to push a certain narative. One of the scariest scenarios is the day the Capitol was insurrected, and the free election process was almost disrupted. Essentially, those who want to seduce others into believing a false narrative can fabricate evidence. What took place on January 6, 2020 was an example of how people were drawn into to believe "stop the steal" which was the total opposite of reality. Lives were lost and property was damaged. All of this occurred because of writings from extremist in social media and even reports on mainstream news like Fox News. We need to call out bad behavior and fact check what politiicans and extremist say about curent events. This is necessary to protect our reality and democracy.

Stand-up and open your eyes to what is real and denounce those who are trying to dupe us with this false reality. Encourage congress to investigate and report on the events of the Insurrection; don't punish those who speak the truth like Liz Cheney and praise egocentrics like former President Donald Trump who care nothing for democracy. Protect yourself from lies by fact checking information and using multiple sources to be informed about current events. Stop the steal of the truth!
