It is often said that first impressions are the most important. Generally I must say that I agree with that sentiment but on the other hand I believe that we, much too often, do not look past that first impression. We are blinded by first prejudices and too prideful to stop and think we might be wrong about them. It is therefore key for people and products to make their first impressions upon us the most perfect. For we, the consumer, often do not look past their first appearances. I believe that we are deeply affected by image and impression.
Consider if that you are in the market for a new book to read, for instance. People often warn not to judge a book by its cover, but isn't that what we all do immediately upon seeing a new book? If a book does not have an appealing cover to us we are very likely to not pick it up at all. But publishers know this and they do the best they can to make their book covers appealing. Likewise, we do our best to make ourselves appealing to the rest of the world. We are so blinded by the appearance of something when it first enters our view that our whole perspective shifts to cater to that first impression it made upon us.
To conclude, I strongly believe that we are too affected by images and appearances. As any bright light can both be beatiful and blinding. Some may say that my take is a pessimistic one, that people are too sensible to be fooled in such a way. To those people I offer this simple truth; we are dazzled by the shine of the stars from far away, but upon closer inspection all stars do is burn.
