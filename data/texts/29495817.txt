While I believe that the best path to happiness is a balance of both pursuing your own goals and trying to help other people, I believe that someone is more likely to be happy if they focus on others and the world around them instead of just themselves. People tend to fixate obsessively on their own happiness and then they become unhappy and unsatisfied when they are unable to meet the goals that they set for themselves.

If you put more focus on helping other people and the world around you, I feel like you are more likely to find true and lasting happiness. You won't be so obsessed with your own outcomes, and even if you don't always succeed at helping others and making them happy, the feeling of pride in yourself and your work can still lead to happiness.

Giving to others and helping them meet their needs activates areas of the brain that are associated with positive feelings. Social connection, trust, and pleasure are just some of the positive feelings one can experience when focusing on others outside of ourselves. Endorphines are also released when people exhibit altruistic behavior.

There are no downsides with doing for others and focusing on bettering the world. I am by no means saying to give up on your own personal goals, just that there is a more guaranteed path to happiness when you try and improve the world around you or the lives of others around you.
