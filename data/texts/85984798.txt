Throughout life, many people think that the only way to succeed is by either competing with other individuals or joining in with others who are already on a path to success that can help them out. In this case, i will explore how both views can be beneifical and the one that I will lead on the most.

In the workplace, school, sporting events etc there will always be competition. This is especially true in sporting events however we can find that teammates will compete with other teammates. In this  life, everyone want to get ahead and sometimes that includes competing with others to simply stnad out and make a name for yourself. People will do this to earn a promotion, get a scholarship  and even to become a mvp of a game. Competition is not bad at all, after all, if you are number one and stand out the most more than likely all eyes will be on you and that can work in your favor. That means that you are the unique one, the standard, the blueprint and this can help out because it means that there is something special about you.

Cooperation also is big in success because often times we do need others to succeed. This can be as simple as just having someone encouraging us such as a parent or a sibling, someone helping us out mentally such as a friend or a therapist. It's important to know that for the most part the people that are genuine for you wants you to succeed and will help you get there. So yes cooperation is important in different aspects becuase that can also help you be successful.

In conclusion, I think that cooperation in my meaning, having a good support system is the most beneficial. You can still be competitive but just knowing that there are others cheering for you can make a difference. I believe that people achieve more sucess by cooperation.
