      Some beleive that happiness comes by pursing their dreams and their own personal goals.  Other believe that people are happy only when they have their minds fixed on some goal other than their own happiness.  So what makes people happy?  That is a very difficult questions, and one with no clear cut answer, as every person is an individual and becaus of that, all their life experiences, upbringing, background, and beleifs will impact happiness.  Also, happiness is not a concrete item to be analyzed and measured.  One cannot come up with a happiness test to measure the amount of happiness that one person possesses.  It is subjective.  One person might be as happy as they come, living a life that another very similar person finds unbearable.  All that said, if it is a boolean option, that either a person can be happy pursuing their dreams and goals, or they can only be happy when they focus on something beyond their own happiness, I would aurgue that true happiness can only come with pursuring personal goals and asperations.

       Now there is a lot of grey area there and room to explore, for example, one's goals and reams might be selfless, focusing on something beyond their own happiness, as in their goal is to focus on others happiness and others goals and dreams.  You might say that would be a cop out, I am choosing most options, and you would be wrong, as my argument has more legs than the other option.  Think of a career counselor, or a college admissions professional, or a teacher.  Im sure many of these people find absolute bliss in helping others achieve their dream.  They are not thinking "I dont care about anyone elses's goals except to make me happy", most likely their goal is to make other people as successful and happy as possible, and are probably not thinking of themselves.  But their goal and personal aspirations are to be as successful as possible, and that success only comes when others are successful.

       I believe the counter argument here that " happiness only comes along when one is not focused on their own happiness" is far to narrow and paints happiness as some sort of specter that you cant acknowledge, that you have to ignore for it to get close to you on peeking at it at the corner of your eye, and that if you look directly at it, it disappears. 
 That�s ridiculous, and asserts if you do something to make you happy, solely to make you happy, that you can never be truly happy.  How would one explain hobbies, or passion projects?  These serve no real purpose except to make the person working on them happy.  Per this argument the people out fishing, or building models, or working on any number of frivolous task are never really happy?  They are just out there wasting time and resources just to be miserable?  That�s absurd.  Additionally, it takes away agency from the one, from the person.  It seems to make it a selfish act to do something that only makes them happy, as if one should be ashamed of doing something that makes them happy.  That is a dangerous, and frankly self-destructive outlook on life. 

\tSo again, I will reassert my argument, happiness comes from pursuing ones dreams and goals.  I also want to quantify �dreams and goals� as those are big words, but they don�t have to be big task.  A dream doesn�t need to be just getting a dream job, or marring my soul mate.  A goal doesn�t need to be earning a PhD, or climbing Mount Everest.  For some a goal might be just to make it to the weekend, or to have a great day at work.  For others a dream might be to get that chocolate milkshake from that one small roadside restaurant, or to spend a day with their kid.  Or, and this might sound crazy, ones goal and/or dream might just be to be happy.  Happiness can be both a goal and a dream that, once attained or work towards, makes a person happy.  A person can make the decision to be happy, work towards that and be happy.  As my final piece of evidence, I made a goal to finish this essay, I have now achieved that goal, and I can feel my happiness rising.
