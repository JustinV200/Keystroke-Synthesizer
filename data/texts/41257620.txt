The real question here today is do people achieve more sucess by cooperation or competition? I feel like this is such an important question and i believe cooperation is the better choice and here is why.
   It takes a village. isn't that one of the most popular sayings? Ive heard it a million times in my life and i never got it truly until i had kids. As a mom i see the competiton between other moms and i see the healthy cooperation and its much better to cooperate an help each other. We need support and love to thrive.  Sure competition is ok when its done in a healthy way but cooperation builds a healthy base of trust and love that can build unbreakable loyalties. There is a sense of peace in knowing we are not alone in life. 
    Cooperation also helps with delegation of tasks. Competeing can cause all kinds of problems related to ego. Cooperation on the other hand allows there to be a delegation of tasks to people who are more equipped to the tasks they are given. This allows people to be noticed for their individual specialties. It balances the workload and responsibilities so everyone has time to rest.        
   Cooperation is so important in building a loving and trusting community. Imagine a place where people aren't driven by being the best and they are more focused on working together as a whole. Sports teams are a good example. They compete but the basis of a good team is everyone working tohether as a whole to win. It also balalnces out so the ones who need a mentor or whatever have that support.  
Imagine if every country could cooperate and build a beautiful utopia. We cpuld all share resources and live in peace. 
 That is why i think cooperation is better for accomplishing lasting success.
