Happiness is a state of mind. It is possible to be happy and contented even if one does not have enough to eat or have many material comforts. For me happiness is seeing a puppy wagging its tail at me or the kid a stranger is walking with looks at me and smiles. I pursue many activities that I like. I do not do them because I want to be happy. I realize that doing them makes me happy. Volunteering for a cause is one of them. 

Looking at the plants in bloom in springtime is another. I become delighted like a child when I see a rainbow. I am happy when my mom appreciates what I cook for her. I feel competent and fulfilled when I make myself a simple blouse. In these instances doing something or seeing something provides me a satisfation. It is in such small little things that life becomes meaningful

I love to travel. I have been to a few national parks. I have travelled to Egypt, Jordan, Israel, India, Canada and Mexico. I enjoy different culture, ethnic clothes and exotic food. I daydream about places I may visit next. Sometimes I just look up fares to go to different places. I love to look up at all the 'do not miss while you are here' list on trip advisors.

Most of all as a parent, a mother, my greatest happiness is in taking care of them. I feel happiness is not a goal to be reached or completing a list. It is in living evey moment of your life in a worthwhile manner. If you can go to bed with contentment it is happiness.

In conclusion I like to say it once again that happiness is not a  destination but a journey. Goal fulfilling, helping others, building a family are only what you encounter on this journey. In order to answer the question 'is happinees possible only when you acieve your personal goal or when you help others achieve it' my answer is it is not in either. It is in your mind.
