    People can achieve more success in life through cooperation and working with others to achieve a common goal.  If you are always competing with others to achieve a goal then you may well get there, but at what cost? Competition tends to bring out the worst in most human beings, when the desire to win overshadows the desire to be a good honest person.

     When you cooperate with others you have extensive resources in those people. Everyone is different and will bring their own specific skills and knowledge to the table. Once everyone has their say and gives their input then you can begin to formulate a strategy or plan to accomplish whatever it is they may be working towards. Whatever accomplishments are made are a reflection of the work that each person put into the task and can be shared by everyone involved equally.

     If everyone spent their lives in competition there would never be the degree of advancement we see today. People would always worry about not being the best or better than someone else. Always trying to make it a little better than something else instead of accepting it as it is. Eventually success would become very isolating because not everyone will be able to succeed in everyday life. 

     Competition produces a winner and runners up but cooperation produces a team that can do it all. I would much rather cooperate with others than to compete with everyone.
