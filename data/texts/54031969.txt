Are you happy? Do you know what happiness consists of? Here, we are going to discuss the topic of happiness and try to understand what gives us this important word, happiness.

Happiness is different for each one of us. In my case, waking up to the smell of coffee starts my day with happiness. I know, it's something so small, but yet so meaningful.
Another person's happiness comes when expecting family or friends coming to visit.
Still yet another person gets happiness from larger things, vacations, spending money on themselves, or still yet purchasing new items. 
We are all different.

While I don't have studies in front of me,  I have lived 67 years and have met some wonderful happy people, as well as depressed, angry, unhappy people.
The common thread I notice is that the happiest people seem to be born that way or adapted to being happy.Most of the people I know who are happiest aren't that way from spending money, but they are happy from their surroundings, the simple things in life, a bird on their windowsill, a phone call, a great smelling cup of coffee for some examples. 
Still yet, people also are happiest when they are happy with their relationships and work life.

Now I know some people will say I have no clue what makes people happy. There have been times I have ask someone I know why they are unhappy. I come to learn these people don't really want to talk about it . Even if I offer an ear to listen, I get somewhat pushed away. I've also noticed there are personality differences in people. Some people are medicated to help lift their spirits.

In the end, we all should find ways to cope and hopefully be happy. Sadly there's a whole population out here who do not want to try. We also know mental health treatment is costly. We hope for the best for them and wish that everyone out here finds there happiness.
