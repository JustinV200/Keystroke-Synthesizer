Materialism is an interesting topic as people may be very conflicted about it. We may feel that we value many people and experiences much more than our possessions or spending money. Personally, I feel that materialism is a vital part of our lives and it does not equate to just having things. When we have money and are able to spend it, we also can have wonderful experiences. These experiences may be traveling, a delicious meal with friends, buying items that make family and friends happy, taking courses to learn a language or to paint. You can explore different culures, communities and try different foods. You can take a boat and explore the different Greek Islands, get to know the people and their philosophy of enjoying life. That lesson is priceless.
Most will tell you that money cannot buy happiness. It cannot. However, not having money can be a hindrance to fully enjoying your life. It can lead to depression, fear, a lack of food or good housing and basically create an unhappy environment. 
I don't feel that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic, mainly because I do not believe that materialism is just having things. Materialism allows us to also live full lives. Materialism allows us to have tech to connect with others. Even during the pandemic, we were able to communicate with friends and family and even see them. This is not to say that you cannot be happy if you are poor or if you live a minimalistic life. This is to say that, with money, you can have experiences that will fill your heart and expand your mind. Materialism is not a bad thing at all.
