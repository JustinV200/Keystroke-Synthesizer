The current society is driven by the need to want more and acquire more without ever reaching a satisfactory state. Majority of individuals will go to vast extents in order to acquire wealth and material possession without consideration on whether they hurt someone else or take advantage of another human being to their detriment. 

Some people will argue that this is the way of the world and the current society is a ' woman eat woman society'. Even though I agree that we are living in harsh economic times that is not to blame for the nature of materialism that exists. I will point a finger on the decay of morals in our society and the lack of the passing of vices from our grandparents and parents to us. Westernization of the world has taken a toll on how we view life.

It is very clear that no one wants to suffer and every person walking the earth would wish for the finer things in life, but that is different for each and evey person. Two hundred thousand dollars in salary might set someone for a fullfilling life that is full of happiness and satisfaction, similarly a million a year might still not be enough for someone else and they might still be looking for more to satisfy their ego or life for that matter.

Others will argue that a fullfilling life comes from chasing money, wealth and material. They add by saying life will be boring and meaningless if we were not looking to acquire more. I have seen people die faster after retiring from work and staying at home jobless and on pension than those who keep themselves busy with businesses and creative things.

In the end life is about moments and experiences and self satisfaction comes from within. The world is filled with a lot of fake news, fake people and societal pressure especially now with the existence of social media the young and old have the existential fear to achieve more and be in a certain way. Let us all meditate, soul search and remain stoic.
