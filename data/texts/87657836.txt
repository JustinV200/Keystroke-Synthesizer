Everything around us these days is bursting with bright colors or overly-promising words.  Just the other day I saw a new apartment building that had gone up with a neon "peace" sign on it.  I'll admit, it was very eye-catching and peaked my interest, but that initial impression was enough to distract me from the glum surroundings, as I had forgotten I was in a more run-down part of town and this was definitely NOT an ideal new home.

People in society today are always to quick to jump onto the latest trend, or be on par with what is "woke", that they forget to take a step back and ask if they really need what they're purchasing.  Flashy things are always fun at first, but are usually only flashy for a short time.  I think it is better to stick with tried and true items, that we know can withstand time.

Another thing of note with all the big, bright, flashy new items coming out, is that there is always some reference of nostalgia.  Products are being replicated (with astoundingly low quality) that reflect past generations.  Everybody wants something vintage, but nobody wants to put in the time it takes to make these items with such craftsmanship.

I think a lot of the television programs and social media apps with rapidly changing content are a big reason for this.  TV shows change scenes every three minutes, and TikToks last sixty seconds.  How are people supposed to remain happy with one product for a long time, when they have all been conditioned to always be looking for the next new thing right away?

In my opinion, I think people should stop going for eye-catching items, and instead focus on creating sustainable products that can withstand time.
