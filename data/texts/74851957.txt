It's no secret that we as a society are influenced by others. Starting at an early age, kids in school are affected by their peers--wanting to dress or act the same way as the "cool" kids in order to fit in. Similarly, even adults feel that same pressure as they get older--wanting to portray themselves in a certain light in order to get a promotion or make friends with their coworkers. 

First impressions are important. They give people a fast insight as to the person you might be. For example, candidates running for President have only a few short minutes to make an impression on future voters; similarly, when interviewing for a new job, you have only a short period of time to make a lasting impression on your fuure boss in order to gain employment. In the media, a celebrity may come off as wholesome because he or she seems to have a "picture perfect" image. What society may not see is that behind closed doors, that same celebrity may be doing drugs or abusing his or her spouse. Impressions are important, but actions are most important. 

While images and impressions have a lasting effect on people, it's important to take those same things with a grain of salt and get to know something or someone on a deeper level in order to gain knowledge and a full understanding.
