In my opinion, people are more likley to be happy if they focus on their personal goals rather tham on the happiness of others.  However, I also view this as the idea that one can not exist without the other, and that the presence of happiness must exist in a specific order.  

For example, I stronly believe that people are not capable of giving themselves to others in a genuine way unless they are happy within their own lives, at least not genionely.  From my perspective, we can never offer happiness to other people or to humanilty as a whole unless we are happy ourselves becase we, as humans, will unintentionally fail at being one humdred percent present to fulfill such a selfless, altrustic deed for the greater good outside of ouselves.  

Even with the most extraordinary intentions to do good, we are unable to be our true selves, which is who we need to be, when attempting to focus on the happiness of others unless or until we have successfully achieved our own personal happiness, whatever those goals may be.  Happiness is more than just focusing on pursuing our own goals, but a much grander picture of the universe that, once accomplished, can spread beyond our imagination.
