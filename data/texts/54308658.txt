Competition is the law of nature.  However, in certain settings it is far more benefical for people to look at cooperating with one another depending on the goal they are hoping to achieve.

Everyone has a different skill set.  Because of this, it is best to identify what each indivual is successful at and look at how to apply it to the needed task.  This works very well with the right amount of people.  In this scenario, though, it will obviously require someone to take the lead role.  

Once everyone can agree on who the leader will be, things will begin to work smoothly.  It is necessary to have a structure like this as the leader will then be able to assign other people their roles in order to complete the objective.  This type of cooperation is literally the basis of our capitalist society.  All successful businesses run well using this technique as it provides more success for everyone involved.

Once a group has been able to coordinate themselves and have everything working as necessary, then the fun can truly begin.  Once the team is in sync, then they can look to who their competition is, and begin to structure  a plan in order to out perform them.  The same structure scenario, pursuing a different end result.
