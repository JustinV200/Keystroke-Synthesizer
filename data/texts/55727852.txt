The prompt says about the appearances are mistaken for reality. That means many of the product advertisements created and showed to people for creating favorable impressions but  not telling the truth about the product. That was really bad. They only promote their products with colorful packages. It creates fake impressions in people minds and forced to buy the product withou knowing it is good or bad for their health and also the society.

When the question rises,"Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?", i say "Yes". The sad truth is most of the people doesn't consider the contents, advantages and disadvantages of the product. They only buy products with the appearence and first impression of the produt advertisement. Also the manufacturer or seller do not tell about the good and bad facts about their products.

When i went to shopping, i saw many people just buy or take the product by it's appearance like color, packaging, and offers fot that product. None of them see the ingredients, expiry date, origin of the product. All because of advertisements. Yes, clever advertisement create favorable impressions towards the product. Like in media, how certain entertainers, politicians and other public figures appearence is more important than their abilities. Same followed in product advertising. As a conclusion i strongly accept, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.
