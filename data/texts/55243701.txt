                                                                Being Happy
         Being happy is the only thing that humans wants in their life. But not everyone can get this only lucky fellows can get it. Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others? According to me being happy by seeing the happiness of others makes people to be very happy than pursuing their dreams. 
         For example, If my aim is to get university first means when I get first surely I will be happy but If I take care of my parents well and I am keeping them to be happy means Both my mom and dad will be happy. By seeing their happiness I will be more happy than achieving my dream.
         Ofcourse we have to pursue our dreams but dont forget that we have to make others to be happy. If you achieve your dreams it will make you and your family to be happy. But if you make  your surroundings people to be happy. By seeing their happiness you will be autoamtically happy. No matter where you are and no matter what happened in your life make others to be happy and be enthusiastic.
