    People absolutely acheive much more success by cooperation. There is success in the input of others to reach a specfic and/or various goals. In life, many try to get to the top fast on their own without even thinking of anyone. 

   Case in point, there is competetion for sporting events such as basketball, football, baseball, soccer, etc. Without the cooperation of each other's teammates, there would not be anything accomplished at winning the game. Each team member needs the other. How can a quarterback get the ball without it being thrown to him? How can a soccer player get a goal in without offense and defense? An orchestra would sound horrible with one one person as a chorus and one person playing a violin. One can acheive their goal with the help of encouragement to keep going. Also if one fails, he can get back up with the help of the other. In the Bible, the Israelites could not have built the wall around Jerusalem successful without help. While others may assume that one person could do this on their own, you can clearly study geography and see that that would not be possible. The Philistines were defeated thinking that they had Goliath who could take care of it all by himmself, to only lead to his death by David a young boy. He only used five rocks from his bag to strike him dead. A competitive spirit only brings one down.
 
    In conclusion, a lot of things will get accomplished with the cooperation of more than one person. Although competition can get one to some places in life, history has shown more success in a group effort.
