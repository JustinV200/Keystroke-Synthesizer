  These days, it seems like everywhere you look there's an advertisement for the newest gadget or novelty. Consumerism has invaded the majority of established holidays, and "sales" and "deals" have even grown to create a holiday entirely of their own, Black Friday. Spending money on material possessions has become part of "the American way." There is an old saying that money cannot buy happiness. So what is the true value of the things we spend our money on? Is such a materialistic approach healthy for us, both as individuals as well as a society as a whole?
  The answer is a resounding no. The only ones who truly benefit from a materialistic lifestyle are the people who make the profit: large corporations. The vast majority of Americans don't ever see that kind of wealth. Living paycheck to paycheck has also become a way of life here. Yet there is increasing pressure to spend money on the latest thing to hit the market, to "keep up with the Jones'." There are also upgrades that sometimes need to be made to keep up with technological advances.
  This increased pressure from society may be one of the reasons that the number of adults experiencing depression and anxiety has also risen. Especially at a time where many Americans are having trouble paying for basic necessities, the added stress of budgeting for "luxury items" can be too much.
  There are those who say "if you can't afford it, then just don't buy it," but that's not always a solution. It is almost impossible to stay employed in this country without being able to stay connected, and with the technological advances in recent years even the homeless need a smart phone to stay connected with resources. Society is transitioning more and more to a digital world, and everyone needs to be able to participate.
  The way that modern society has allowed capitalism and materialism to divide us as a country should come under harsh scrutiny and criticism.
