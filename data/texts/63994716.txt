How much is too much? In today's modern society we are suffocated with the falsehood that materialistic things are vital to our survival. We are shown through the media, and especially online that materialism is something to be honored or idolized. Another issue that comes with materialism is the notion that once someone has the desired things in life that they are more important than the next person. Are possesions really what is important in life? We should always stay critical of modern society and materialsim, or else we risk a society of empathy and human kindness. Firstly, in modern socitey we are bombarded with the idea that the rich and famous live better lives than we do. However, this is a lie that we fed from media that people who have more money are better off. Deep down everyone still has issues or problems that all sorts of people deal with on a daily basis. No matter how much money you have or fancy things you can afford everyone at the base is human. No amount of materialistic things can replace love, friendship, or family. Also, another reason to always be crticial of materialism is to keep society on their toes. There has to be limits to the greed and materialistic lives that people lead, if others will not speak up who will? For example; the obsession with billonares and their fortunes will never cease to be a topic of discussion. Spending billions of dollars on private jets and throwing parties is shameful and society should be critical of it. All in all, materialism should continue to be criticized by everyone. Especially in todays modern society when all we see in the media is non-stop bombardment of advertisments, celebrities, and brands telling us that these materalistic posessions are meaningful. We should always question the greed and materalism of our society, there has to be some sort of cap to the depravity of materialistic lifesytles.
