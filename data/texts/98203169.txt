I am writing about why images and impressions have way too much of an effect on people. I will tell you what I think and my reasons for thinking this. I do believe the statement of images and impressions having an effect on people to be true.

People are affected a lot by what people look like on social media for an example. People routinely compare themselves to others and it then affects them negatively. Many people develop anxiety, body dysmorphia, depression, eating disorders and many other things due to this. Often times people have even comitted suicide due to not feeling as though they are good enough.

Some may say that this is not true and the issues are just in peoples heads and that they are weak, which then makes them susceptible to these things. I have seen many times where people have said that they actually have been negatively affected by things they see online and how it hurts how they view themselves. I have also seen studies done that corroborate what these people feel and say.

In conclusion, I am stating that I do believe it to be true that images and impressions can have too much of an effect on people. If less emphasis was put on images and impressions, people would less often be so adversely affected and would then be that much happier.
