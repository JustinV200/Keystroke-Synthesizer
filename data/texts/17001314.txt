How much is too much? It's a question often asked, and it's an important question to ask, not only for ourselves, but for society as a whole. In a day and age when it's possible to possess an ever growing collection of goods, does it actually make our lives better? I believe that it doesn't. I believe that it actually clutters our life and wastes our time.  I believe that a materialistic society disconnects us from our true purpose as human beings and should be criticized for its negative effects on human relationships and our connections to nature.

Modern society is based on convenience. And to have convenience, we need to depend on things, not necessarily people. And that is the problem with materialism: it disconnects us from relationships and nature and addicts us to things that can never really replace what all humans need: true connections to others and  nature. We can fill our houses with beautiful things, but still be void of love, of understanding of what it means to be human, of compassion, of truly knowing what life is about because we are distracted by pretty objects. And so, I believe it is better to rely on people and nature and our own ingenuity and resources than to expect material objects to make us happy.

With less material objects, and the time and money it takes to maintain them, we have time to focus on our relationships, our passions, our connection to the planet we live on, the important things in life instead of concentrating on what we can acquire next. A beautiful sunset cannot be owned, but it is priceless. And in this day and age, can you even imagine how many of them you've missed because you were inside with your things? It's an important question to ponder.
