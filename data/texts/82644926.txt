Materialism is very common in today's society, but should one be criticzied for being materialistic? I feel that the people in society should not be criticzied for this behavior in today's modern times. 

As an adult growing up in the late 70's to now, I have seen society change numerous times and in numerous ways. One of the biggest changes throughout the years has been technology. When I was a child until most of my teen years, we did not have cell phones let alone the internet to occupy our time. I feel that my family was very unmaterialistic and valued family time like meals spent together and having campfires at night and going on afternoon hikes. However, with the advances in technology and the ease of the average person obtaining these advances, like the cellphone and laptop computers, our family changed as well. My siblings and I grew up becoming more familiar with these luxuries as well as many other technological advances. As you start to use these in your daily lives, they start to become a part of you. The more you use things that make your life easier or more fun then we as people or naturally want more of these things. The average person today uses multiple technologies on a daily basis, some necessary and others not. One perfect example is "Alexa". This is not in my opinion needed in daily life, however, a perk for those that can afford one. All of this behavior is just a natural progression overtime.

As time goes on, people will continue to crave more technology, more futuristic advances to make their lives easier and more interesting. Some people would consider this being materialistic and criticzie others for excessively aquiring those "things". I stand by my view that we should not criticzie our society for being too materialistic as this is just a natural progression of technological advances overtime. This I feel too, will only increase as we improve the technology of tomorrow.
