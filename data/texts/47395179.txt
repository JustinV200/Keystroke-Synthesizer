   In my point of view the success was mostly achieved by cooperation.Because the cooperation in any field leads to success.Every company gets higher position by getting the each and every employees cooperation only,not based on the competition.
                                                               

  Competition was need but not for all one those who wants to achieve.The 0nly way to achieve success was only by the power of cooperation.For example we can get the examples of some company,just to see those companies the companies get achieved only by their employees cooperation.If the company gets competition means their mind was only get tensed and their employees been work for only targets not for achievements in my point of view.


  I'll just explain these examples in my point of view only.When compared to both the competition was leads to failure.But the cooperation of each and every tasks get mostly the suiccess.The cooperation is significant in this world to achieve the success easily.The competition was good but in some situation it goes bad between the competitors.But if the victory was gained by using the competition it will be the great victory.


  So based on me ill suggest that the cooperation is more significant than competition to achieve the success easily.These are my conclusions about these prompts.
