   True happiness is in giving happiness to others. Others include, in my view, family members as well. I can write here some of my life experiences to affirm that taking care of others can give more happiness eventually.
   I am born from a lower middle class family. When I was about eight years old it all started helping my mother who was sick. It was tough and a burden at that age to take cae of my mother and managing studies. People around me used to throw a pity look on me and some encouraged me that I am doing good and later in  my life I'll reap the fruit of it. Rarely did I have a happy face those days. In my college days a goal of mine started rooting in me that I shoud have a job of my own which would help me and my family. Though my mother was not getting better she wanted to respect the society's views and controls and hence never allowed me to go out to pick a job. 
 Then after marriage again my focus was towards happiness of the family members which means spouse and children. Working tirelessly for long hours and years, and after losing my mother, today I am living in U.S. with my family, still working and supporting my family. Now peolple say that I am  living a decent life but I think I am living a happy life with my family which is my mother's blessing.
  We can live a happily life after making others happy. Better late than never.
