Whether people like it or not, they will spend a vast amount of time and effort trying to acquire money. It's an uncomfortable truth that no matter how much we tell ourselves that money and material things can't make us happy, we are materialistic. Our materialistic society is a reflection of our materialism. Therefore, I propose that a healthy view of our materialistic nature and society is a balanced view. I accept my materialism, but do not shy away from criticizing over indulgence.

Money makes the world go round. From a young age we are taught the importance of making a living for yourself. The education system is tailored to increase the odds of people entering the workforce and becoming able to provide for themselves and their families. An important part of a healthy society is a healthy workforce, and the need and desire for material things is the healthy motivation behind it.

We are also warned of the danger of becoming too engrossed in trying to acquire wealth. An inumerable amount of fables and stories tell cautionary tales of greed. Also harmful is the over pursuit of happiness from spending money, or the false belief that happiness can only come from spending money or material things. While money may be necessary to live a happy life, many fail to "see the forest through the trees" in this regard. They sacrifice more worthy pursuits for the frivolous and unnecessary.

Some may argue that the things money buys them makes them truly happy. This happiness is more akin to a temporary pleasure, not true joy.

Materialism is our nature, but to be truly happy we must be its master, not its slave. Modern material society has enslaved many.
