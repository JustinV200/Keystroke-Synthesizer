Materialism has been criticized by some people in our world today.  However, each person on this Earth is materalistic.  Where we differ as humans, is to where we land on the scale of materialism.  

Each person goes throughout the day acquiring and spending money.  Why do people go to work?  I don't think you are find many to say they do it for the thrill of it.  People work to earn money which they in turn use to buy possessions.  The whole idea of materialism is what makes society work.  If people did not want to acquire items, what would be the need to create any of these items.  People would not have jobs or any way to support themseleves.  No one should be citicized  for buying things that make them happy.  The idea of materialism is what drives and motivates most people.  The desire to get things makes people work harder.

It is true that most of energy during our lifetime is spent producing and consuming things.  We all have to work together as a world to do this.  One person is skilled at producting certain things that someone else might need.  This is a valuable asset.  Materialism should not be criticize but praised.  Materialsim is what makes the world work.  It drives people to achieve their goals and gets the world moving and growing.
