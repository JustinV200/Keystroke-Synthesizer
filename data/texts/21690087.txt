  Materialism is something I believe is ingrained into our society. We are all about improving and upgrading, especially our stuff. We set our goals to work hard to make more money to buy better things. We set idols of our objects. 
  Finding freedom from want can often be found in freeing yourself from the standards and philosophies of our modern day world. We are constantly being bombarded with ideas that we need more. Ideas that we will be happier if we live easier. Although in some cases this can be true, we are often tempted to forget the pure joy of loving and giving. 
  We will never truly be content if we are always in the hot pursuit of something materialistically better. The chase for satisfaction within our stuff is like an eternal ladder that you can climb and climb but will never reach the top. We find ourselves setting unrealistic goals, to achieve some trivial pleasure, that we realize we never needed and may not have really wanted. 
  If we opened our eyes to the hurt of the world around us, we wouldn't feel so fixed on our minor discomforts. Materialism in our society is a good way to create blind eyes towards those in need and should not be smiled upon or supported.
