People are happiest when they find the balance between their own happiness and the happiness of others. As humans we are very interested in trying to find something outside of ourselves to focus on. This is normally found in other human beings. If we are able to help other  humans it, in turns, brings some level of happiness to us, as it is deeply imgrained in our nature to want to be an asset to our own kind. Personal growth is also very important because if we are not attaining the goals we have set for ourselves we will remain unfulfilled. It is important to strike that middle ground between ensuring our own happiness but also striving to maintain others well being in the process. It can be a difficult challenge but also a most fulfilling one.

Through the ages there have been many goals that humans have strived to reach in order to reach the ultimate enlightenment or happiness. Many examples of  this include fame, fortune and notoriety. In the end many of these  things reach a dead end and do not provide the sought after result of happiness. This is because there is a lack of empathy for others in these pusuits as they all meet the same qualifications of seeking after selfish goals. 

In conclusion, I believe that humans need to consider their dealings with others, as well as their own selves to ensure ultimate happiness. There will always be opportunities that come along which benefit ones self, but it is also important to consider who else may be affected positively or negatively and choose accordingly. At times there will be hard decisions that need to be made where only one party may benefit. In scenarios like this it is important to tread carefully and consider the consequences. We all need to look out for each other and ensure mutual happiness for everyone as much as we possibly can.
