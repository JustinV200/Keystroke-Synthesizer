It may be said that happiness stems from different sources for different people. Differences in personality, values, environment and even politics are often contributing factors to defenitions of meaningfulness in one's life. However, a person should start with the source, themselves, and focusing on personal goals is a more effective path. A journey begun by seeking fulfillment outside of one's self will likely fail.

A goal is a purpose, and this is a solid foundation. These objectives obviously hold tremendous value to a person and pursuing them may not be 'fun,' but the impacts and lessons learned contribute vastly to quality of life. The confidence, self-worth and achievement gained will build a critical 'happiness infrastructure.' Goals will branch out infinitely as one discovers interests and enjoyment in all sorts of endevours along the way. You will dicover new strengths and skills, inspire enthusiasm, and find genuine pride. Goals do not exist in a vaccuum. Do the hard work, earn the merit, and reward yourself after. This cycle will play itself out for a lifetime, and it stems from within. 

One cannot base their satisfaction based on results sought in others. This is a flimsy structure, and ultimately will disappoint and collapse. Bringing happiness to others is rewarding, but it is most authentic and lasting when you have done the work inside yourself first. Your own successes will grant you the ability to share, project and enrich the life of others. Double the joy. You can't move somebody else closer to their ideal life if you are far removed from that yourself.
