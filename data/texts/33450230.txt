    Happiness is all about how the person sees it and it really does not have no defined definion. I believe that happiness is defined in the eyes of the beholders. When we get to specifics about happiness we lose the true meaning of it. With this certain rule of happiness I think people will more likely to be happy when they are doing something they truly want to do. So it all has to deal with what the certain person wants to do.
    
    People could really like helping others and this would make those people very happy about doing that. When these people help others it brings happiness to their life and it makes them feel like they have a purpose in life. Helping others makes people have more self confidence and it helps with wellbeing.  This links a lot to parents and how these parents help their kids and it makes them happy to do it. The other spectrum is a little selfish in my opinion and really doesn't last as long as helping others. Yours goals will make you happy when you accomlish them but will be over fast. When you help others you know that you are doing good. 
     
    With all this being said happiness really is the greatest when you help others and make others lives better. Helping others brings them happiness and it also brings you happiness. Just putting a smile on others faces can bring you with happiness. It makes you feel better when you help others knowing you made their day just a little better. The power of two people being happy outweighs just one being happy from pursuing personal goals. Finding happines along the way of helping others is a double plus when your goals are actually to make others happy. That is why happiness through helping others is the best way to make humans happy.
