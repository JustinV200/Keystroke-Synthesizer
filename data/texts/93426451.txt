Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?

I believe that images do have an effect on people but depending on th eimage, it can be too much.  The impression that I get is that images and impressions are intentionally attention grabbing, especially in advertisements or public service announcements.  Images that grab attention or are sexually suggestive or use attractive models are always eye catching.  

I feel that images are always used in any ads or messaging to draw attention to them.  If I imagined or saw an add with all black and white words, I don't there would be any attention shown to it in any way.  Online ads are the same since eye catching pictures are used a lot in between paragraphs, in page margins or pop ups.  Images showing disturbing or wierd images get people to look closer or click on it to see if it will provide more detail.  Images are defintitely more effective with online ads since there is more opportunity to provide images or ability to insert them.  

In product marketing it is far too often that videos showing miraculous results such as spray on car scratch remover that shows perfect results but not so much in reality. Images and videos are a clear attention grabbing method and th eonly intention of them is to have an effect on people to grab their attention and get clicks and drive traffic to their website or stores.  Too often, I see that these images are showing moe than what the value of the end prduct is and in my personal experience I have shut my attention off to them because they are so ridiculously inaccurate.
