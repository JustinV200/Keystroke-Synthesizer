I think that being happy is how you see yourself.  I think that I am a happy person all the time.  It is how I want to perceive myself as being a happy and kind person.  I never lose my temper.  I am respectful to everybody.  I think it is how you perceive yourself in a day to day world.  I really do not think that you need any goal for your happiness.  I think that some people are just happy and kind people all the time. Then there are other people who are not.  People tend to carry their differences with other people with them throughout the day.  They are not happy, so then they are miserable.  If I can be kind to everybody then I feel good about myself.  If it is just a simple gesture like holding the door for somebody or letting a person get in front of you when you are out shopping and maybe they have there hands full, like I just did this morning. All these small gestures that you can do in your day to day life makes you a happy kind person.  It doesn't need to be anything else, to be happy.  Being happy is a state of mind.  You make it yourself.  Pursuing your dreams can certainly make you happy, but I think it is mainly a state of mind.  Either you make yourself happy , or you can be miserable.  It is all how you make it for yourself.  That is all I have to say about pursing happiness.
