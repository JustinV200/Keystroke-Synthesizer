I believe we get more done together than apart. Teamwork is the key to sucess in most instances.

The collective can be a powerful thing. Many minds coming together rather than one limited mind who may not be able to think of all the possibilites. You can think of it it like this: one computer is less able to do computations that a bank of connected computers who work together without competition or arguing or having self interest at its core. 

Whether in the workplace or on a broader worldwide scale cooperation can achieve great things often in less time. In the office a team can have several people working to achieve a goal, for example one is working on the research of a project, others are working on materials aquistion, others on cost anaylsis. Imagine how much longer it would take if one person was doing the task alone. On a broader scale what if NASA only had one employee that was in charge of getting us to the moon? Both small and great things can be achieved by working as a collective. As I touched on before working together helps to allow people to leave their egos and rivalry aside-two aspects of personality which sometimes can get ugly in social settings.

There may be cases when lone achievement is appauded or competition against each other is valued, like in sports for example. I say, however, in the day to day events that really keep things going and matter on a large scale working together is more valuable. To achieve more and achieve it faster with more innovation having the collection of minds working together is ultimately more important and significant.

Whether in politics, business or friendship having a "team" working togther for a common goal is not only rewarding for society but for the individuals of the team as well. Also there are those of us out there that prefer "team" sports rather than head to head competition between indivuals. In these sports there is much more learned by cooperation and planning as a group.
