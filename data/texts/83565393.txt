I prefer not to use the word happiness because it seems so circumstantial.  It changes with the ebb and tide of culture and humanity.  What I prefer to think of in it's place is a state of joy.  Humanity is born with purpose.  It can't be narrowed down to only once specific way of achieving joy or happiness.  

One of the greatest needs of man is not only to be loved, but to love, to serve others.  It is when out of a selfless being you serve the needs of those with whom you interact that true joy is produced.  Just like the Dead Sea is at the state it is in because it only received and never flows out, so too, is man.  We become dry and stale when we only receive and never let ourselves flow into the lives of others.  

The beginning context of the argument is the discussion of whether happiness is achieved by pursuing one's own goals or they fixate on the happiness and humanity of others.   I believe joy is achieved by balancing and sustaining both.  As previously noted, true joy comes from pouring out of oneself into the service and benefit of others, but it is also achieved by including self-care.  If all we do is give to others, we run the risk of losing ourselves and the richness that comes from nurting the desires and needs of within.  

In conclusion: happiness or joy as I prefer comes from both positions.  At times, due to circumstances, we have more of one than the other.  But in the end, both are vital and must be included to remain in balance and harmony with oneself.
