   Although competition is usually a good, healthy way to show your skills and get recognition for your strengths, but when it comes to business ventures and their success, competition against your peers is not seen as a winning strategy. Winning is the cooperation of the whole team, everyone putting a piece of their best into a project is were a business can really bring it to the top.
    We all know that one co-worker who always out does everyone on every project, they always walk around strutting their stuff. Sure their ideas are pretty amazing, they are known by the whole office, usually well liked, sought after, and always think their ideas are the best only ideas to use. The downfall is that only one employees thoughts and ideas are always being used, over and over again. Meaning you eventually have nothing different, new, or exciting to share and your client becomes bored and seeks new employees.
    Now come back to doing the same but with a few different perspectives and ideas, now we have very different perspectives and idea paths to work from. Take a little something from each employee, actually working together without competition, can be very enjoyable if your team can really put themselves and their ego aside. No one has to do it alone, or be stressed about deadlines because the whole team is striving for success
