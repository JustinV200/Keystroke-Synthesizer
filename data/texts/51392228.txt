Images and impressions definetly have too much of an effect on people. things such as social media has only worsened this. There are three reasons why image has too much of an effect on people. First, people are so worried about their image it can effect physical or mental health. Secondly, there are editing apps and tools made because people want to change their image and lastly people will do extreme things to look like an ideal image or get a good impression of somebody.

Mental and physical health has been so negativly impacted because of peoples obsession with their imafe and impressions. People often can become depressed or anxious because there is such a big stugma of looking or acting or talking a certain way. Physical health is also affected, people can develop eating disorders or start crazy diets to look a certain image.  

Editing apps are so normalaized in todays culture that some people cant even tell whats real or whats fake. These types of apps is what has led people to an unhealthy obsession on images and impressions. There are apps to edit pictures but also videos, people can change almost anything they are insecure about.  

Lastly, most of what around us is fake. Many people will use these flashy techniques or crazy apparatuses to look like something their not. Such things as false advertising are normalized in todays market because people like to see something too good to be true. 

In conclusion, I believe images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. It is effecting peoples health; both mental and phsyical.
