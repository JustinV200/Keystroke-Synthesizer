Cooperation or competition, which is the best way to obtain success?  While cooperation can be effective, it is hard to sustain.  Competition brings out determinaton in people, but often leaves the majority of participants (losers) feeling dissatisfied.  Both cooperation and competition have pros and cons and perhaps should be chosen on a case by case basis.  However, in my experience, competition achieves success quickly and to a greater degree.  Also, I think the success lasts just as long as any success obtained from cooperation.

In my opinion, competition is more effective than cooperation most of the time.  For instance, when I worked in an elemetary school, one classroom lagged way behind in number of books read.  I made a bulletin board and did graphs, updated weekly, between the grade levels.  The lowest class soon became the highest.  The teacher said it was because of my graphs.  She didn't want the others in the school to see the poor performance of her class.  So she encouraged her children to read more so she could see her class graph looking good on the bulletin board.  
   
Therefore, competiton brings out the drive and motivation in a person that they may not have even realized was there.  Wanting to shine encourages someone to put forth the extra effort.  Being seen as the best makes one feel good, and it is a very postive reinforcement.  Although a good feeling can be obtained through cooperation, the feeling is not as strong, and the results are not as marked as one would obtain with competition.  Competition is the key to a high level of success moreso than cooperation.
