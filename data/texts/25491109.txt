According to human nature,people will always want to happy but at the same time the pepole will pay close attention to how happiness comes.So here happiness is because some people are happy by making someone miserable and some people are happy by making them happy.Most of them achieve their goals and becomes successful and make their families proud and majority of people do not only find success in their aim but also find joy in the humanity of others.

If we closely look at this ,it is very difficult for us to derive pleasure from the humanity of others.Here humanity is very reduced here as everyone runs here for their own selfishness and daily life.Here,wherever we go,happiness is in a way,because the situation here has made us happy in a way.So people are running towards their goal and succeeding  in that goal is what they set as the motivation of every human being.because here success means they decide to get success in their favorite field and their goal is to find success and happy with it.

Finally there are few people here who think that they should be happy by seeing the happiness of others.Because there is a lot of jealousy and deceit among the people here,so that cannot be destroyed even any of the age.if it can be overcome,humanity must be born in all peoples,So most of these people want to be happy and successful in their own goals.
