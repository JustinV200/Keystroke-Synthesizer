But local folklore says it began when Caveman Ralph became envious of Caveman Jones having three clubs, four sabertooth pelts, a spear, and six wives.  Caveman Ralph called Caveman Jones materialistic, and that is know the phrase 'Keeping up with the Jones' began.

    Over the millenia, materialism has not changed much since the simple times of cavemen.  People want things, and things need to be made.  So factories use natural resources and turn them into the things we want.  We tend not to have an infinite amount of resources on this planet, so eventually there will be a problem.  All of these factories making things consequently brings pollution and greenhouse gases, endangering our planet.  At some point we have to start criticizing modern society for being materialistic because our planet is precious and we have a duty to protect it, even if that means having less things.

     For people who don't think society should be criticized for being materialistic, there is a reasonable argument.  Acquiring and having things is something that motivates people to achieve success in life.  For them, having things is a way to metaphorically 'keep score' in their lives. Others argue that materialism is just a part of human nature, and shouldn't be perceived as a bad thing.  

     From the days of the cavemen, to modern times, materialism has been a ball-and-chain for society.  The quest for more things may be part of human nature.  But that doesn't make it a noble quest. Individuals can do their part and help fight materialism by throwing all of their belongings away. Get rid of your car, walk everywhere.  Get rid of your clothes, walk everywhere naked.  This is how our society should be!  I urge you, fellow human beings(especially attractive ones), walk everywhere naked and save the planet.
