Yes, todays world is going after the money. why they need money? because its the main thing to buy things whatever they want. In ancient times people are depend each other. They were bound to each other with love. they didnot spent much interesting in materialist world.  nowdays each person is educated and well mannered but their thoughts are revolving around meaningless objects.

 We humans are born with nothing but while growing our wishes also growing with ourselves.  people are more concerned with their appearance and the brands they are using. based on the brands judging one another. everyone wishes to live a luxurious life. 
These thoughts embedded in our head. That leads the person to spend more on buying goods.
 
normally the people of middle class also started to spend much money to show off their lives. They are also try to compete the rich people in terms of living style. But this not good for the people who cannot afford the consequences.

unfortunately people are always chasing money and power.  The brands and the things they are buying shows their status so they are willing doing this which brings more power to control the people with no status. but they dont realise things are replaceable but people are not.
