It all depends on what is being done and HOW it's being done. Honestly there is not a model to base the findings on. From my honest standpoint, cooperation is key to building long lasting success. The fact that all of the pieces conhesively work together to build, lets says an empire. Everyone has a role or a hand in the building process and everyone SHOULD know their roles within the empire.


On the other hand, I can also see that competiton actually makes you better and sharpens you in a way because of the mounting pressure thats placed upon you to either make or break you. Honestly I appreciate competition. Alot of my skills came from wars and battles that I have won and I appreicate the fact that my opponents still thinks they are my enemy. What foolish lames. That's another issue with competiton. Some people cannot let go of a defeat because they cannot see the bigger picture.



At the end of the day, the issue is within and within themselves to sort out why they do what they do and figure out how they will move and go about their daily lives. They need to do some deep diving and I hoep all goes will for them and I hope for the best. A positive mindest actually goes a long way. What also helps is having tunnel vision to see what mission you want to complete and you put all of you power to making it happen.



So with both sides of the coin being seen, I choose cooperation more that competiton. You gain more and learn more. I do appreciate the fact that you get the choice to choose which one works best for you.
