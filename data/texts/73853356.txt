Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?  

Writing from the perspective of an American citizen, I maintain that American society should be criticized for our ever-growing consumption and disposal habits.  Long lauded as a beacon for capitalism and industry, the United States has also faced the consequences of  the excessive consumerism and materialism that goes hand-in-hand with unchecked capitalism and greed.  

Historically, American materialism has caused us to enslave other humans to further our quest of greed, and to justify those actions.  In less glaring ways, materialism has pitted us against each other, caused countless to go into massive debt, and has wreaked havoc on our mental health.  

Now, some maintain that materialism and capitalism are vital aspects of the American Dream.  But, the American Dream seems only attainable by a handful of people these days.  The wealth gap has widened, especially during the Covid years and recent inflation, and many strive in vain or find themselves with debt that they can never afford to pay off.  

Materialism has led to a throw-a-way society where products seem made to replace very quickly as well.  From Apple phones to washing machines, we are bombarded with advertising touting the latest and greatest, and subtley told that we are abnormal if we don't have the newest gadget or toy.  Holidays have become warped odes to our materialim, instead of time spent with family and friends.  

In conclusion, society would be much better off if materialism wasn't held in such high regard.  If our citizenry could step back for a moment, and reflect on shared values, protection of our environment, and why we consume in the ways we do, I think we'd be better and stronger as a nation, and much happier as individual humans.
