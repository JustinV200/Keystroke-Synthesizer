The answer for the question are people more likely to be happy if thy focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others  is that depends on the situation. this is because when the people focus on their personal goals they become very happy because when we focus on our own goals it gives satisfaction of doing our own goals but that even sometimes will make us not happiness because when we focus only in our goals that make us selfish and make some bad impressions among others and others will say some bad about us. but when people is not ready to think about others then they can focus on their own goals.
               the next thing is when the people focus on happiness of others that too make satisfaction among people because some people like to make happiness of others. when others happy then the person who made them happy also be happy. this focus on happiness of others will make good impression among others because the  person is thinking about others.
                  the answer that depends upon the situation means when the person focus more on happiness of others then the person will loose the concentration of thinking about his goals.
so being focus on their own goals or happiness of others is based on the situation of their own.
