Yes images and impressions cause a big effect on people. Both as consumer and as socity we look up to entertainers and public figures because the impression they put up for the public to see is lavish and dreamable. Even though we deep down know most of the things they say and show is fabricated we still fall for it because we can't have those things in our life.

Extravagant looks and popular looks hide lot of dark and sad truths behind it and that is what people furget when they see these entertainers. Putting on such a mask and pretending all the time can cause a person their mental health. Having all the life moments and problems in front of millions and millions of people is hard and the people will easly spread negative commands about such puplic figures.

Over all I would like to share that impressions can cause a lot of changes in socity and they way people counsume product or services. But the bigger the first impression is the more bigger should be the once that follows it. Life is too short to be wasted on such thing but to be lived at it's full potential as we keep. Yes imprssions are important and go a long way but in long run people need to let that screen down and let the public to see the imperfections and the issues to understand that they are alos people.
