Nowaday most of people in the world have a perception that first impression has a tremedous role in our daily life interaction. Personally, I agree that first impressions including appearance, behavior, and body language is extremely important in order to achieve better outcome in every situations. 

To begin with, conversation is an essential part for any job interview. As a result, first impression with the interviewer will make or break for any candidate. Though there might be some biases but this current process is the best among other methods to select potential applicants for the role. During the interaction, the employee can understand about the streng and weakness as well as the personality of the interviewee. Many companies also conduct two or three rounds of interview in order to gain a holistic 360 view about the candidate hard and soft skills. Therefore if a candidate makes a good impression, they will have higher chance to get hired by the company. This is because we as human often want to make quick decision as well as visual and verbal interaction help people complete the task faster than other procedure. 

In conclusion, I strongly feel that making a positive impact in any interaction is the key to secure desired outcomes. This is because it helps peope make quick judgement.
