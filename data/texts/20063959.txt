Cooperation or competition - which one will yeild higher success for people? I believe that cooperation will ultimately yield higher success than competition. 

There are many reasons that cooperation will yield higher success for people. One, if  we are all working towards a common goal we will be able to reach that goal more quickly and efficiently than if some employees are more interested in elevating their personal interests over those of the organization. Cooperation is also great for idea generation and brainstorming. It's great to practice listening to ideas from others. We live in an age where we are not great listeners, working collaboratively can force us to listen more and consider other ideas. 

As a leader, it is apparent to me which of my staff have their colleague's and the organization's best interest in mind as they are working towards a goal and which ones want to compete and win at any cost to elevate themselves personally. 

I understand that competition can be a motivating factor for some, however I think if the focus is taken from the common goal and placed on "beating my co-worker" then eventually it will catch up with the individual in a negative way. Attempting to win at any cost will create a hostile work envoriment. Unfortunately, competition can also become deceitful and dishonest in a number of ways to both the people involved and the organization.

Overall, I think that cooperation is a better foundation for building trust among your co-workers and within your organization to hopefully create personal successes as well as success for the organization.
