What is materialism and how do we know we are a materialistic society? As we look a around we see it across every county, every state and every region of our country. Most Americans own more then what is needed for their essential survival but does this make us materialisitic? Do we warrant the criticizism that is thrown our way? 

When we examine what it means to be materialistic we tend to focus on two things, the actual purchasing of items and the emotional connection to the items we purchase. When asking anyone within this country many will say that our country is materialistic and will criticize how materialistice we have "become". What if we are asking the wrong quetsion? Criticizing modern society for being too materialistic is semi-equivalent to critizing a victim of abuse. Would our society be this materialistic if the products were not available to them? Enter any grocery store and any individual item on your list may have five different options. 

When we talk about whether our scoeity should be criticized for being too materialistic we should first examine what and who is creating the actual products that are being consumed. We criticize the individuals that are doing the purchasing as if they are the ones that also generated the products for profit. Our society should not be criticized for things that are placed before them. We should instead think of the questions that are being asked and examine who would have a motivation to criticize the individual for their purchase. Would a large coporation not have a lot to gain? It would be easy for them to minimize their waste, over production and constant profit seeking model by placing the blame on the individual consumer.
