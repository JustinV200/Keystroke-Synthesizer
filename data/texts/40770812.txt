How often do you find yourself looking in the mirror while getting ready for your day? Have you ever asked yourself why? During my morning routine, I spend an average of 30 minutes looking at my reflection and deciding if I like what is looking back at me. I believe this is because of the way society judges people and things based on their appearence and impressions. 

Its far too easy to misjudge people and even objects, when the images were shown are meant as a distraction. Its easy to misjudge the box of brown hair dye and think it is a particular color because of the images on the box. But when we pay closer attention to the ingredients or reviews on the color, we get a better look at its true color. People often get distracted by appearences and images without taking a moment to understand what they are looking at. Most images and impressions we see today are fixated on societal norms and only show what they think society wants to see. 

Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people and not only their decisions, but their overall judgements. Society is more likely to gravitate towards what is shown as normal rather than something unique, which is why most forms of advertisements are mostly the same in one way or another. The effect that images and impressions can have on people can be both positive and negative, but ultimately, they shouldnt cloud a persons ability to form their own opinion based on their own perspective and personality. When this happens, its easy to say that the effect images and impressions has is more negative as it takes away a persons freethinking ability and allows them to conform to the societal norms they are surrounded by.
