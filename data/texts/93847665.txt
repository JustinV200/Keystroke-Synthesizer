     In life, at some point, you realize that happiness comes from within yourself and no matter what you have accomplished, it is not guranteed to bring happiness or joy. Wishing to be like others or having what friends or family have does not always bring true happiness because it is only temporary. When a person realize that they are happy with simple things and that they do not have to spend money to be happy, then perhaps they can start finding happiness in everyday activities.
     As a person goes through life, things happen and plans change. What seemed important becomes the least important. What defines happiness is within each individual and what makes them personally happy. Some people find happiness being around children and family, some may find it in nature hiking up a mountain, others find it volunteering or even accomplishing a lifelong goal toward sports and helping the team win.
     Some people may feel that happiness occurs by focusing on others and eventually your happiness will come while you see others doing better, for example, feeding the hungry or volunteering in a shelter, helping animals, volunteering in clean up trash around the beaches and waterways. Happiness can be accomplished this way, but a person can also focus on being happy while they are doing these things. A person can persue their career and work where it does not feel like a job because they love what they do. 
     In conclusion, happiness is what a person feels on the inside and only you can truly make yourself happy. Having a balanced life helping others and not neglecting your own pursuits will add toward your happiness.
