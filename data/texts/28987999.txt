            Yes, people tend to be more happy ,when they focus on others happiness. Humanity is decreasing in a tremendous rate now a days.the helping nature of people are decreasing by the acts of personal goal improvement.The goal seeking is important for everyone but the improvement of humanity is also essential in day to day life.

           The increase in self importance prevailed in all teen agers of the society.They like to enjoy thier life in all manners leaving the concept of helping others and giving importance to others feelings as well as accepting advice of elders.This leads them to wrong decision making and bad impact in thier life in the long run.
             
             By helping the poor citizens and donating to them, help them as well as help us in improving our self worth and self confidence which leads to the success of our own personal goal achievement.By only concentrating on our own life and not giving importanceto other's feeling  leads to a hedonism life ,bad habits and immoral activities which make them as thieves and murderers.So we should focus on the well being of poor and giving our atmost importance to the feelings of others.This  helps in our self goal improvement also.
