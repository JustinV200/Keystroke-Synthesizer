I am cosidering myself as a happy person. In which they ask about are people likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others. I am focused on my own personal goals, which only the thing made me myself happy in my life.
Always I have a thought of, one should made happy them self first. If they made their soul happy means the surrounding around them is also a happiest one. Most of the things are statred from inner self of one person. So own self is happy means definitly the people around them also in a happy mode.
I always spread around my surrounding So I made myself first happy through to this I made people around myself are also in a happiest mode. None other that persuasive my own goal is my ultimate goal in my life. Through to this I can achieve many thing in my life. So I can focus on myself to in my personal goal achievements. After that I have help to happiness of others also. 
According to me happiness comes when people focus on the their mind fixed on some goals other than the happiness of others and their thoughts..
