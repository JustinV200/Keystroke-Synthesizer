People are more likely to be happy when they focus on a personal goal.  By completing or progressing towards completing a goal, it provides a sense of accomplishment and gives you pride and joy that you stay self-disciplined. For example, if a person had a goal to lose 50 pounds and already lost 10 pounds. The progress would potentially make the person happy that they were making the right actions and decisions towards a goal and towards taking care of themselves. By seeing results after the work has been put in is exciting and is something to be proud of and celebrated.

Being successful in achieving goals leads to a great mood. Whenever, I have a success or have completed a goal, I am happy. I feel that it is always best to follow your heart and dreams. If your heart is in it you are happy to put in the work. For example, I always wanted to work as a school secretary. It was not an instant success, but once I was in the role, I was happy and satisfied that my dream came true. 

Improvement and acheivement is always great. It is good for acheiving the goal but is also good for the soul. When you are successful and are working towards your dream, happiness is not far behind.
