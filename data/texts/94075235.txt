From ruining young girls' body images to promoting false advertising, our obsession with looks is detrimental to our society as a whole.
Since the advent of mass media, it has been used to signal to women what they should be doing, how they should be doing it, and perhaps most "importantly," what they should look like while they're doing it. In my experience growing up in the early 2000s, I fully believed I had to be blonde and thin to be beautiful because all of my favorite celebrities were. I am neither. The expectations were and are unrealistic and cause eating disorders in young girls to this day.
Our society's emphasis on looks can also lead to false advertising. An advertisement can be aesthetically pleasing and people will buy the product being advertised based on the perceived beauty of the ad alone. Product features and quality become less important in this landscape. Ads often show the product looking much nicer than it will look in reality. For example, McDonald's hamburgers never look quite like the images that "beautify" the drive-thru menu.
Some would argue that we are turning away from our looks-centric society. They might say the popularity of celebrities like Lizzo signals this. The reality is that Lizzo is still relentlessly bullied online and if anything, Instagram and TikTok filters are the 2020s version of what I experienced growing up in the early 2000s. We are lying to each other about what our bodies and faces can and should look like and even about what the products we create can look like in person. When and how will this twisted societal obsession end?
