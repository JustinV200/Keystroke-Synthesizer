What is the best path to success? Competition or Cooperation? The answer lies within you. 

There are many different personality types in our society, each with its own quirks. Some are extroverted, and look outward for validation. Some are introverted, and look inward for guidance. Which are you?

It is said that those with extroverted personalities are more social, and more open to input from others, while those who are introverted are basically the opposite - they avoid social contact and rely on themselves for answers.

When it comes to achievements, which is better equipped to succeed? And which personality type prefers competition and which seeks cooperation? There is no cut and dried black or white answer. In either case, those that are outgoing, are more likely to deal with others in any capacity. Although it's possible that someone could be competitive without the other person knowing. They could just be keeping an "internal score."

In conclusion, figuring out your own path to success is an important journey for all of us. We must ask ourselves if we want to make friends or enemies. It's the same as figuring out for yourself if people are basically good, or basically bad. What you reflect to the world, you're basically good or basically bad, is probably how you feel about others. So the question of success by competition or cooperation is not 100% either way for everyone, it depends on you, your beliefs, your actions, and your journey.
