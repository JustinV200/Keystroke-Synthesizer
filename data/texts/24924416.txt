When it comes to main stream media and other forms of solicitation, I truly and deeply feel that images and impressions have too much of an impact on people. Regardless of what the product is actually doing. People are heavily influence by what is "in" and what other people have to say. A brand or company could be unethical or immoral but most people would turn a blind eye if it was endorsed by someone they thought was "cool". 

For instance, if any given company hires a favorable celeberity and makes them stand next to their product, a vast majority of Americans would buy/consume that product in a heart beat. Many people rather be ignorant to the truth. Some other tactics that are seen in real life are the aid of visually appealing art, music or a topic that many people can relate to; like the idea of a close knit family. Things like this will draw someone in and people will get invested and sometimes not even know what they are investing in. It just looks "good". Politicians famously paint pictures of being for the people and by the people. They tend to use ideas and mentalities that their voters share, just to get themselves into office. 

To conclude people are very impressionable and easily manipulated. Most comapnies and deep pockets know that if you have the right look/popularity then the sky is the limit. The common folk usually do not dig deep enough to see what is really happening and solely rely on mainstream media and others for their information. To most Americans ignorance is bliss.
