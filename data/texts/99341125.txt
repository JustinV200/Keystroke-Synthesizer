Yes thc current society,is being criticized for being too materialistic,and moreover being materialistic isnt too bad or too good,spending more money having said that but it is bringing more happiness,isnt that bad,but the current society tell that is the bad one and it cant be done.So we are thinking that way money is the most impotaant thing in life but it is  not.

Materialism attitude of someone who attaches,with the money and that give more material things,that imposes great attitude to have and thinking that way,moreover people in current days are like this,but  we cant criticize easily ,its their wish to be materialistic or not,so we cant tell that easily.By being more material and eith more spiritual or intellectual,its gives a person happy for some period of time,it is a good one,but it is not good for all,if they are having enough money its ok but not for all.

 
Good materialism is the fruit of a search,for a genuine and balanced life for material objects within the overall context of good life.Yes if this is good people cant be crictized if it is in good way,and healthy life.It isnt a shame being a materialistic person,if a person believes that being materialistic and lead a successful life with it it is acceptable.
