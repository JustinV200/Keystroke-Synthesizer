I believe people can be happy if they focus on their personal goald . if someone keeps himself busy and focus on himself he can achieve great happiness in life. we often get emotional over many things like our private life our relationship life etc many things but we don't focus on the good things that is around us. people should avoid things that makes him/her feel emotional or dissapointed. people can achieve many things instead of being happy I'm someone who gets jealous of someone success or someone's achivements but I never was happy because I was only focusing on themself where I should have focus on myself but now i'm trying my best from my bad past I''m trying to improve myself keep myself happy and not to focus on others acitivity life's fun when you keep it private and success never be dissapointed by others succes be your own be happy with yourself with what you have and work more earn more bever let your paste get over you. but if you have time and and money to spare then you should definately seek for humanity and charity because charity makes you kind and proud so if you have things to spare give it to  your parents. if one should think of others happiness then they should work for their parents. life is only happy if you keep people who loves you and care for happiness then you should do it for them too.
that's all I think from my side.
