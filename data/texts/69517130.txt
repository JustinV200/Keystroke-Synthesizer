 Cooperation and  competition will bediscussed in this passage. Cooperation is working  with  others to get a task done. Competition is seeing  who is  the best at a particular challenge. I  believe one  must choose between cooperating and competing depending  on what is best for the situation.

We will start with an apple picking competition  as  an example. One can work alone orwith a partner. If one  works alone one  cann be  free of distractions, have  no one in his  way when picking and make his own rules. If one  hass  a  partner  one can double  the speedof picking,  potentiallly reach higherspots and have someone to cheer him on. The teamthat is cooperating  will most likely  pick more apples.

One would argue that thhe  cooperating  team would  definitely pick more apples. One would  also argue the team cooperating would  have to share  the prize. In this situation one may be better off sharing the  prize as opposed to winning nothing if doing the  task alone. One  could also argue half a  prize is  not woth it so it would be better to compete alone.  

In  conclusion one would be best off making  the choice to cooperate or  compete depending  on the task. One may findthe  prize or feeling  the best is worth competing. One  may also find working withh someone would give one  a  better chance  of winning  but  would half  a prize be worth it? Overall I feel one  is best making  the choice depending on the  prize and the chances of succeeding withoug cooperating. The definition of what success is  for the particular task would also make  a  difference.
