Happiness is a versatile thing. Happiness differs to person who enjoys it. For someone, happiness is helping someone, for someone happiness is sharing things with others.

Happiness not only means someone have to have a big house, a lot of oney, huge amount of property, luxury cars, big business, lots of people surrounding you. It always differs person to person. As I said, happiness is sharing, helping, motivating, achieving etc. It takes a lot of time to make person to believe that nothing is constant in this world. All the assets , properties, money will stay here in this world but th emperson may not be able live forever to enjoy it. It is always about the love,mindset and choice. Happiness is a choice. But how do you want it is up to you. Billionaires may not be happy after achieving many, but a homeless or a begger may find his happiness after getting some money and to eat. Some may find their happines is reading different books, watching movies, going for a ride, or exploring new things.

These kinds of happiness increases the pleasure of mind and makes a person joyful. Money, assets are needed to persue the human life but running after money for the whole life would be useless cause theres no meaning of being happy.
