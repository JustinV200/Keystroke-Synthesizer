Happiness.

It's long been the common goal of nearly every human that has lived, while at the same time playing the role of an often unattainable reward that always manages to seem unfairly fleeting or brief.

Well, today I am here to present as to why I feel that people more often than not tend to find or realize their happiness when focusing in on their own personal goals. And, why I believe that despite the fact that we humans are social animals, that we find true happiness, meaning, and satisfaction in our pursuit and eventual realization of our personal ambitions and goals.

While the case can made that humans feel happiness when helping one another, it's also important to realize that the very act of assisting another human being is a choice - a choice that in of itself is a self-imposed personal goal that very often comes with expectations of a reward, whatever that may ultimately be; recognition, admiration, a sense of greater morale, a greater sense of belonging or self-worth for example.

At the very heart of every action that we undertake as a species, there's an inherently selfish bias. But, we aren't the exception when it comes to understanding and embracing the narrative that while despite there being an ego-centric catalyst that ultimately at play in regards to our decision making, we still often strive to fulfill personal goals that often benefits and brings happiness to others in turn.

Humans often strive to be the very best version of themselves. But, if their own happiness relies solely upon the happiness of others, I would argue that said person risks losing a sense of themselves as an individual. It's while in service to said individuality that we find purpose and validation in who we are and our beliefs as a whole. And there's nothing more human than that.
