Today I will be writing about materialism and why it is so important to me.  I understand to some people it isn't a big deal to have many items to enjoy - to wear, play with, collect, or whatever it is, I guess I would be called materialistic to a point.

I have several things that I feel like I need or want a lot of in my life.  Of course, materialism isn't something I have to have to survive, just sort of a passion to me.  So probably my favorite thing to have a lot of is "tops" to wear.  In the winter time I have quite a few sweaters - but never too many!  My husband keeps telling me to get rid of some of my tops, then I can purchase more.  Well, that is not me because I like all of my tops and it is difficult for me to get rid of any of them.   Now that spring is near, I will soon be out buying more new tops - cute tops with pretty spring/summer colors.   My tops make me feel happy and when I am happy, my husband is happy!

I can see why some people aren't into materialism - some because they do not like the extra clutter in their homes.  Some because they are happy with just what they "need".  Then some people just can't afford to have a lot of items, even though they would like to.  

In my opinion no one should ever be criticized for being materialised.  It is exciting, fun and  I am very proud and happy to be materialistic and I plan to stay that way!
