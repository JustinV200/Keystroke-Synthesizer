History is awash with stories of strong leaders who overcame all the odds to become the best in their field. This is often a product of myth-making. In fact these leaders are usually the products of large support systems in which they are mere figure heads.

Cooperation is the creator of these leaders, competition only seeks to limit the overall effect of any project. Any significant lasting accomplishments attributed to these leaders are the result of cooperation of their support groups and not the rigorous competition seeking of individual leaders.

The limitation of a leader is always their time. The only way to overcome the limitation of time is to bring in others to their project. Focused cooperation on a project increases the size of the effect, proportional to the number of people working on the project. If the leader worked on the project alone the effect would be limited by his time commitment and his immediate surrounding area. However, a leader can bring focus to a project and mold the cooperation to a specific result. So the position of a leader cannot be taken for granted. A leader can allow a project to over come initial misteps through this focus, which could doom a project and never allow the cooperation to take place.

Although the leader has influence over the formation and focus on a project, their limited effect leads to the problem of their time. The proportional effect of cooperation on a project is the only way to lead to significant lasting accomplishments. Competition sought by leaders only seeks to limit this proportional effect, which ultimately leads to limited success.
