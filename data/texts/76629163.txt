Why are  appearence are mistaken for reality ? some say it is the new day in age when color seek out more farther than an actual product other say its the way the item or product is being advertsied and how it quickly grasp others or the buyers attention just buy the packaging which say little or nothing about the product its called more so i think product advertisement people or companys do not worry about or aim at the product being sold they want their product to be noticed which if deemed to be possible they create a good package that will be noticed my shoppers or intresting is it a good idea yes becsue no matter what product is being sold weather it is  make-upor the  clothing industry in every product field is the same so i also believe comanys know it competition and want their product to stand out from other competition in the indusry  which is a way now days to make sales which is why i agree with the statement what we think we see becomes far more important than what really is (reality) because the packaging can be besutiful or you may like it and insome cases we tend to buy products just because or just becsue a favorable impression it had on us
