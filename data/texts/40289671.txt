I believe both coporation and competition has their advantages and disadvantages but for me I would stand towards coporation, as coporation for me tends to get me more success than being competitive, during my last job, I experiece a cople of incident which was a perfect example of why being coporative is an healthy way to promot organisation success, I was an employee for a small firm with about five employee, and the environment I was employed in was very toxic as I recall that everyone was very competitive towards one another, intead of working as a team, I find it very difficult to adjust as no one was even willing to teach me anything as they all felt like I was going to use such knowledge tooutsmart and outplay them, which was against the company policy, and it was coming at the expense of the company revenue, now no one was willing to help anyone, and no one was willing to teach anyone, it felt like everyone was an enemy looking forward to the downfall of their neighbors, everyday felt like torture as I was not used to such working environment, so I was forced to report to the owner of the firm which he ackwnoledged that he knew what was happening and he has done everything within his power but seems like nothing was working, so since am a peaople person, I begin to engage employee one after the other just to be friendly and over time things became different, and before I left the firm it became a comfortable environment as everyone learnt how to trust each other.
Now certain thing changed and one of them was the result, as the company revenue increased, and turn out was really high because everyone was sharing ideas within each other and this brought in a new norms and very positive results.
The reason I wrote such experience is because competition has brought in more negativity than positivity, in families, working place and even amonsgt friends, being competitive has lead to jelousy, enviness and betrayal, because when someone is moving higher than us we tend to be jelous of their success and the next thing that happens is we beagan to wish for them to fail so that we can be ahead of them.
people have don terrible things because someone was more competitive than them, others have made false accusations to get their co workers sacked because they want to stay on top and eliminate every competion.
cooperation on the other hand has promote positivity, as organisations has experience magnificent growth and development because everyone worked together as a family, sharing ideas and working collectively, it has promoted love amongst everyone, which is a good thing.
with this I can bodly say it more rewarding to be coopertive than being competitive, and I conclude that in our everyday life we must remove the urge to be competitive and rather strive to be more open and cooperative. we should also try and encourage others to see reasons why we should desist from unhealthy competition has its a destroyer of ones life, a destructive tool which we must learn to fight against. coperation and collaboration is definetely the best way to live an healthy live.
