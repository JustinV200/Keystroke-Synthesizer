while i agree that Materialism is a loathed concept and heavily critcized in todays society, one has to remember this world is evergrowing we have vast knowledge and generally love to experiment to make life easier, things today are made to be discarded after use, and upgraded.
 I agree that Millionaires and Billionaires spend way to much on frivolous items like multiple houses, yaughts and private jets for themselves just to flaunt their riches contributing only to the ultra weathly's pocketbook is a frowned upon materialism and should be thats excessive spending for nonsense. 
When people of means spend their money buying apartment buildings to house citizens especially providing lower cost housing, opening businesses that create jobs, buy planes,trains, automobiles that provide needed transportation for the masses or when the poeple in poverty finally may be able to earn enough and save for that house, car or computer they need for work i don't consider that to be materialism. to me using your money to help others pull themselves up out of poverty and achieve things in life and a chance to do the same for others is a gift and we wouldn't have that without the knowledge, growth and the concept of Materialism in todays society. so in closing i will agree excessive unecessary materialism is cringeworthy but in my view not all materialism is bad.
