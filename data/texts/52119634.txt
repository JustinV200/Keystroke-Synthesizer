I think that people are more likely to find happiness if they focus on their own goals than the happiness of others. This way, they can pursue what interests them, which is more likely to bring them happiness. Additionaly, people who try to help others can end up forgetting about taking care of themselves. The most sure way to find happiness is to focus on your own self interests, not others'.

Finding out what interests you is the first step towards personal happiness. Once this is figured out, one can make goals related to a field they are interested in. If they are goals related to something they are interested in, working towards then will be inherintly enjoyable. Improving yourself in this way should bring happiness.

Some people may find enjoyment in helping others. However, there is a risk in losing oneself in selfless service, and forgeting to care for yourself.  Their needs and wants can become more important than your own. This will detrimentaly affect your mental well being and, ultimately, your happiness.

Though some people way find happiness in helping others, there is a risk of not caring for yourself. The more surefire way to achieve happiness is to focus on your own goals that you enjoy. The concept of finding happiness through helping others is an aspriational goal, but in practice can be hard to achieve when compared to caring for one's own goals in life.
