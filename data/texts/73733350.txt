There is a perception that social media is the new thing for becoming famous. There are many people developin Youtube channels, TikTok accounts, Facebook accounts and Instagrams. Many have become obsessed with the thought of becoming famous and developing a money making platform. This untimately leads to isssues of depression within the person because they feel they don't measure up to the celebrities.

Many young people are commiting suicide or developing health issues because they are too busy wanting to look like a celebrity. I definitely believe that images and impressioins have a huge affect on many people and their families. If your child wants to develope crative content for a  living it is very import to discuss with them the pros and cons of doing it. They should definitely be monitored and managed by an adult. This will insure their safety while using these platforms. It is important to always remind them of good values and to love themself before trying to seek approval from others that they don't know.

It's okay to want to make a living for yourself but a preson should never trade their integrity over money and fame. Many get too caught up into wanting to be like the Kardashians, ball players, singers and rappers instead of creating their own possitive persona. The reality is social media is taking over many peoples lives but a person should never loose sight of the most important thing and that's self love. 

The outward appearance of a situation can be deceptive and will lead to negative outcomes of a persons life if allowed. Some people become more withdrawn from true reality and ultimately become stuck in their dream world. It is very important to remember what's fact and what's fiction when creating social media content and seeking the approval of an outside audience.

In conclusion being a part of social media can be unhealthy if the person creating the content isn't happy with their life.
