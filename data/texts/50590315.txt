Happiness comes in many forms. For some people, it may be setting personal goals like the obtaining the perfect career or job or training and completing a marathon/decathalon. For others, it may be making others happy by giving them love and mental support or helping out with the essentials of life. For instance, food, clothing and shelter. But for me, helping others brings me the happiness to make myself feel happiness and improve humanity . But at the same time, pursuing ones own dreams and goals can also bring happiness to others .

People may say focusing on your own personal dreams and goals can be selfish andf self centered and it can be but in the long run it can . It can be perceived as such when they are in the process of pursuing their happiness it may effect others in some way ... but in the end I believe it helps everyone. For example, focusing on one owns wellness and mental health will help ones own health and well being but because of the happiness in wanting to become healthy and mentally healthy will help everyone in the long run

In conclusion , happiness can come out of both pursuing and achieveing ones own dreams and goals but also in striving to make others happy along the way and improving humanity as a whole.
