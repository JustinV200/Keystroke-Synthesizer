It would appear as though images and impressions have far more of an affect on products consumer's purchase, as opposed to a product that is not as visually appealing.  

For me personally, I can attest to when I am at the local market perusing the produce section, my eyes are drawn to produce that is more visually appealing.  I pick up the product, I examine it for imperfections, so as to ensure that I approve of the appearance.  We purchase the item because we personally feel that this is the best item for us; it looks the best.  We get that container of beautful strawberries home, only to find that when we eat them they are bitter and flavorless.  Had I opted for a container that wasn't as appealing, would that product have been more flavorful and more ripe?  Perhaps it would be more beneficial if we trained ourselves to not instinctively make a purchase based solely on visual appeal, but rather focuse on the quality and end result of what it is we are trying to achieve.  

For anyone who has ever purchased items from the produce section, I'm certain there were times in which you bought that perfectly beautiful, carefully selected produce based on how visually appealing it was.  Only to get home and and learn that what was inside did not represent the exterior.  

Perhaps the next time you are at the market, you will recall your previous scenario, and will instead opt for the item that is perfectly-imperfect , as I know that this is what I intend to do.
