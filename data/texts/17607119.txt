     People are happier when they focus on their own goals than the happiness of others. When a person wakes up to start their day they have specific goals in mind to accomplish during that day. The activities commence with those goals in mind. Every person does this regardless of what the accomplishments need to be.
     Quite a bit of the time, a routine is followed throughout the day. One doesn't need to focus all of their energy on completing their tasks because of the repetition of those tasks. During that time of less focus a person can be kind and helpful and help others get through their own tasks with some happiness in their day as well. However, without being able to accomplish one's own goals, one cannot attend to helping others.
     When I was younger I would have said that others' happiness would have helped me to be happier. I am a very kind and helpful person who needs all the happiness I can get. I was taken advantage of a lot. I was used and abused and, over time, I needed to become more self-centered to keep my head above water. There were too many times that things I needed to get done were left undone. I had to deal with consequences and that made me very unhappy. 
     Accomplishing personal goals, small daily ones as well as larger ones that take time to come to fruition, make a person happier than focusing mostly on making other people happy.
