Materialism is the charactertistic trait of acquiring more and more things. Our modern society is plagued by it. People believe that owning more things will result in happiness but that can't be further from the truth. If someone truely believes having more and more will make them happy they are for sure wrong, because if you ask them to think about if they could lead a happy normal life and while being materialistic they would find the answer. If people keep running for more things to have in their life they will forget to enjoy their life. If people become consumed in materialism they can never see anyone as their equal and they will always to try to rub their wealth on peoples faces.

Now getting to the question, "Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?", my answer: "yes, they should be". As have been stated before materialistic people can't lead a normal life, they always tend to exploit others for their own gain, they always tend to show off their wealth. Now imagine a whole society full of them, it'd be pure chaos. 

We humans have created our civilization and society through working together as a whole, and a group of people only can work together when they treat each other as equals. Thus we can come to the conclusion of problems that we'd be likely facing if we do not stop materialism now.
