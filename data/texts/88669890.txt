I think that people can achieve more success by cooperation than by competition. Competition makes a lot of things hard for people who don't have the same oppurtunities. Intense compentition causes anxiety and other mental health problems. It also causes people to look down on others who never 'win'. It can cause work relationships to be negitivly impacted. It can cause riffs between friends in school.  It can cause disagreements and fights between friends and family.

People who work in groups, even if they do their individual parts of the task by themselves, get more done. For example, a single person may not be able to complete a complex project by themselves in the time that they are given. But when they have a team that they can delegate tasks to they are more likely to succeed than if they were all competing with each other trying to get the entire project finished by the dead line first. Another example can be when brothers and sisters compete for the attention of a parent or gardian. They can fight physically or verbally and depending on their ages it can be very traumitizing. If a pre teen child gets jelous of a new little sibling, they may terrozie them and that could cause a lot of trauma.

I understand why some people think that compitition is a better way to succeed. They may have not experianced the negitive consequences of compitition in their life. I believe that everyone has their own opinions on things like this because the answer is not black or white. I believe that the answer lies somewhere in the grey areas. It is my own life experience that makes me want to be more cooperative and less competitive. 

So, do people achieve more success one way or the other? I think it depends on who you ask. The world is such a complex place and even peoples version of success looks different. To me, I have succeeded way more by cooperating that i ever did competing for anything.
