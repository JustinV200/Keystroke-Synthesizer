 When we look at media and advertising is what we see reality or a skewed version of what the advertiser wants us to believe? Individuals can acquire degrees in advertising and thus to some degree it is a science. Manipulation is most definitely used in the media/advertising in order to meet their end goal...getting the individual/customer to buy into whatever product/information is being sold. As advertising has progressed it seems clear that these images, impressions and manipulations are having an increasing effect on people.

 As evidenced in a plethora of studies it has been shown that the use of deception and subliminal messaging is used to gain support/customers and in fact is very effective. One prime example would be the "War of the Worlds" radio prodcast performed by Orsen Wells in 1938. During the middle of his radio show he "interrupted'" his normal prodcast to announce an alien invasion. Citizens all over the country were sent into a panic, believing that this was actually occuring in real time. 

 In today's society most would consider this absolutey ridiculous because people surely aren't that gullible and yet we see advertising every day that tells us we'll look like a super model if we buy this lipstick or that dress. Advertising tells us that "real men" drive sporty vehicles and are more attractive the more masculine they look. 

 
 Ultimately the Orson Wells example is extreme and yet it became a lesson to media and advertisers that with more subtle deception and maniplulation they have a great deal of success and have an overreaching effect on people's impression of reality.
