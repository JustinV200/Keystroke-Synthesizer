Success depends upon various factors, it is built with many steps behind it. When the question comes that the ratio of getting success compared to cooperation or competition, the first answer in my mind comes that if there should be competition to achieve success , the competition should with ourselves, to get a step ahead than earlier. And with cooperation irrespective of cooperating in others success or themselves it ends up making the perso cooperating successful.
One should must be more into fighting with self to make better versions of themselves. It depends upon the nature of the surrounding or thing your are working for and also the matter of belief that everyone have hol d till now that only the person who is at number one is remembered forever, its a myth. If one student for example say helps and cooperate with other students to score good marks and he gets 80 % and on the otherside one student intensily compete with others without any cooperation to anyone to get the higher rank and scores 90 % then also the studentt who have helped and cooperated with other students if more successful to me as he have his success including the success of other cooperated fellow students and that one must percieve. Even if the student who scored higher rank may get the satisfaction for one moment, it would only remain momentary. And the one who have brought himself also the others will blessed with infinite blessings, lasting accomplishments and a positive perception towards journey of life.
Competition is must without it the rage to win or succed isn't developed with it is better with oneselves for most of the times rahter than always competing with others, and when it comes to compared with cooperation, cooperation is basic human nature and cooperation can lead one to better destination also with better  positive approach and mindset towards life and that more important to achieve success tremendeousaly in aspects of life.
