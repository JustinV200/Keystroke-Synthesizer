Many people find a great deal of comfort in acquiring material possessions. The material possessions they acquire give them a feeling of stability and confidence. The fact that they have acquired material possessions makes a statement about their social status and prestige. 

Acquiring too many material possessions can create problems, though, if it is done excessively. Although there is nothing wrong with acquiring material possessions, it can be a problem if it is done simply for the sake of acquiring material possessions without regard for what the material possessions are. There is no benefit to acquiring many unuseful material possessions. 

For example, people who like to collect things may go out of their way to amass as many material possessions as they can, but the items in their collections may have no real value. Examples of these type of people are coin collectors and stamp collectors. 

On the other hand, the material possessions acquired by collectors of things that are more valuable, such as paintings or other works of art, are more useful and valuable. These things are assets and increase the collector's status and worth. 

My conclusion is that acquiring material possessions, like many other things, is fine unless it is done excessively without regard to whether the things that are acquired have value or not. In general, it is usually good for the economy and is not harmful unless done excessively or without regard for whether the possessions being acquired are useful or valuable.
