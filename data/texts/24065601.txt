Life is noting but satisfaction. Satisfaction is more important than success. But we the people, are hankering after success. For this, we have entered in a world full of competition. This makes our life turbulent. Is there any solution to it? Yes, that's cooperation.

Man is instinctively a weak species. He can not lead his life without the help of others. But now, this species is doing competition among themselves which makes the bonding fragile. Man is political and social animal. So, he has to cooperative rather than become competitive. 

Ancient civillization was not backdated, rather they were much modern. But we only get their debris now. This happens because of their arrogant character and their character of anmity, which were the result of their unnecessary competition with one another. The Greco-Persian War, the Punic War, the Gothic war, the War of the Mongols, the Italian War, the First and Second World War are some examples of the competitive behavior of human. This type of behavior doesn't bring any good result.

Many said that competition is necessary for better world. That's true. But the competition shouldn't be unhealthy. Competition should be in good sector with benevolent intention. Ill competition leads the world in the verge of Third World War which may be held by nuclear weapons. If it hapeens, it will also be a result of human competition.

Cooperation can make a better world than competition among us. We don't need thousand dollars to live on rather we need a peaceful world full of green environment and happy faces which can be achieved by cooperation.
