There are many ways to achieve success in this country depending upon the area of endeavor and the definition of "success". Success can be achieved through competitive practices, or more contemplative practices, or through cooperation with others, etc. But I believe it is through cooperation that success is more likely to be achieved, and that the success will be more long-lasting.

Cooperation involves examination, discussion, generation of ideas involving multiple persons with multiple life experiences and multiple perspectives. As no one person ever has the "only" idea that will work, the combining of discussion/ideas/solutions of more than one person exponentially increases the likelihood of success and the attainment of the desired outcome.

Of course there are many situations where a competitive environment, even if it is competition with only yourself, which will result in more success than a cooperative environment would. Examples that come to mind are athletes who engage in individual sports such as swimming and diving. Or the pianist who is intent on perfecting a particularly difficult composition. Or the hunter intent on harvesting enough game to feed his family. In these instances, however, the accomplishments are of a more temporary nature.

On the whole it is the cooperative drive to produce the best possible outcome that I believe accounts for most longlasting successful outcomes. Cooperation may take longer as you have to evaluate and QA things like feasibility and effectiveness and broad applications. And it is usually more slow-going when incorporating different ideas and perspectives. But over the long run, the accomplishments of cooperative endeavors are more stable, more effective, more satisfying and less flawed.
