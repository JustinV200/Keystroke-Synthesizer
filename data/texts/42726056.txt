                                                               Cooperation vs Competition

In this fast moving world, everyone doest not attain their success. Only the people who have immense hardwork in their passionate work were able to reach their success. You may fail several times during your journey, but the continous effort and hardwork sure will payoff at the end. Right now the questionable conversation is, people achieve more success either by cooperation or competition.

Competition plays a huge role in driving success of an individual. Because it forces the people mind to behave crazy in finding out various ways to finish their task earlier. So competition must be there among each and every individual so that their work will be perfomed fast to complete it before the timeline.

But compared to competion, cooperation plays a vital role in people's success. Because, sometimes in rare cases people might make mistakes during the journey of their success while performing so fast without caring about the accuracy of the result. This might lead to failure at last. A single handed person's success takes more time compared to group's success. So cooperation makes people to think smarter, finding different alternative ways, and a group discussion all together gives the best success . Not only the success is attained with accuracy, the success might stay long last. Cooperation is meant for less time consuming and long lasting.
