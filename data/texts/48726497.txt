     Both cooperation and competitation have its own merits and in their own way are valid. On one hand achieving a goal through ones own diligence and effort is quite an accomplishment, and on the other hand a team effort can make the unachievable attainable.

     However unlike competition, cooperation ensures that the goal is achievied by all parites involved.Cooperation brings about a group goal of achievement and allows for a team experience. It helps to show people how together we can achieve more than a person can individually. It is a great way to for people to realize that regardless of race, ethnicity, color or caste that when working together no of it matters. Everyone is focused on one common goal and achieving it is all that matters. The group as a whole gets to rejoice in the win. 

     Although some say that working together takes away from individual achievement, the camaraderie and joy in cooperation cannot be achieved in an individual challenge. Compitition does allow for one person to prove that his or her efforts and time have been rewarded. It makes the person more focused on achieving the goal since he has no one else he can count on. This can be good for the person's self esteem but it does put a lot of pressure on them as well. 

     In conclusion, all in all cooperation is a great way to motivate people to combine forces and together reach for the goal. People do achieve more success by cooperation, as the stress and goals are divided up among several people on the team. That leads to better communication and helps build new realtionships and bridges in and through different communities, overcoming the divisions of religion, race and ethnicity by unity. One for all and all for one!
