Images and impressions obvsiously have a large impression on most people, hence the old saying , a picture is worth a thousand words. But by what meausre would we determine that the effect is too much, not enogh, or just about right?

What are you showing people images of? A sandy beach with bottles of cold beer , or the aging Marboro man riding off into the sunset on his horse coughing his lungs out while dying of cancer?  Whether or not the image is having too much effect depends on what the affect your are trying to cause.

An image is the easy way to get into most peoples mind's quickly. It has a visercal impact, there is little analyses for most people. Complex language and thought takes time , many people will not pay attention, some will not read with sufficient depth. So if you want rapid impact on a large number of people, a striking image is probably the most effective way to get it quickly.

The downside of this is that the responce you get can end up being very superfical, based soly on emotion, may not consider subtle details, and amount to being little more than propaganda. 

Ultimately the question of what is " too much " has to be balanced by a thoughtful and mature analyses and requires detailed use of language skills.  We all like the idea of the sandy beach and the cold beer but, do you really want to live there? And who created the image for what purpose? 

An image can be powerful and distill a complex set of ideas into a single powerful form that makes it accesable to many people.Like Andy warhols image of soup can. It expressed and criticized the central dynamic of consumerism by turing art into consumer product.
