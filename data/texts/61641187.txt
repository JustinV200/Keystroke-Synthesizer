We all live in a materialistic world where most of the people are concerned more about what they possess than who we are. So, What is Materialism? It is nothing but materials provide the greatest source of satisfaction in our life.
      Now-a-days we rely so much on technology. Although technology has been an amazing contribution to the society it also has some negative impacts in our day-to day life. Children are more interested in playing video games a rather than outdoor games. We also rely so much on our phones and computers. It has changed that only money and materialistic object determines one's happiness.  People are more fascinated about cars and clothes. They want the best just in order to impress their peers.   
       On the other hand if we see materialism is also good because materialism contributes to personal fulfilment and betterment of society. People strive hard to work harder . This improves individual income and living standards. thereby promoted economic properity and social progress. It gives self satisfaction.
        Materialistic people are less happy than their peers because they strive hard to satisfy themselves. They lack self satisfaction. They run after the money.They experience fewer positive emotions than others. they suffer high anxiety, depression and substance abuse.
        On the whole materialism drives innovation and advancement in technologies. It has both pros and cons but materialism can be used to advance humanity for the ultimate greater level. So, Modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic.
