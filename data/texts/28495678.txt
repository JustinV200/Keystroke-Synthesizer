People are more likely to be happy when they focus on the happiness of others. A life lived with a sense of other-directed purpose is its own reward.

Striving to improve other's lives - in large ways or small - is intensely gratifying and fulfilling. This is based on my personal experience and that of those around me. By focusing on goals that help family, friends, community or country improve, a person attains a sense of achievement, competence, accomplishment and pride. These feelings in turn result in personal happiness. This is not a giddy, jolly, or frivilous sensation; rather, it is a deep serenity and certitude that one has contributed to humanity and one's life has had meaning. It may be on the smallest scale - rescuing a kitten or helping someone across the street. It may be huge, like rescuing a village or inventing something to ameliorate climate change.  But either way, the best evidence that happiness follows service can be found by looking at and studying the lives of those who follow that path.

Some might argue that focusing on the well-being of others robs people of their own dreams and results in failure to pursue worthy goals. It is unrealistic to expect people to walk around in a haze of dreamy idealism; without self-interest, people simply will not achieve and therefore will not be happy. That's the reason people are told to "put on your own seatbelt first; then help someone else." But being other-directed does not mean neglecting oneself or giving up on improving one's own life. To the contrary, the happy idealist will make sure they have all the personal tools they need to accomplish their overarching agenda of service; they have their seat belts buckled but immediately assist a child.  This person takes care of themselves but always looks outward; that's the source of happiness.

In short, dedication to causes, aims, and actions bigger than oneself is the surest way  to fulfillment and happiness.
