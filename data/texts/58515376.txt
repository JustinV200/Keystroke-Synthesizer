Materialism - this makes the whole world very selfish, people who is possesive and concerned about their own things are leading a restless life. They always want to spend their money on luxury things rather than helping the needless people. We always face criticism for being materialistic.

People always waste our energy in having more and more repeated products by making our place more dirty therby occuping the place of the most wanted things. If we are doing this  as a parent of a child, it will create a bad impact on them and we are being a bad example to them. Sometimes Society treat these materialistic people as a intelligent and a roll model to the whole world 

Materialistic life won't give a happy and healthy life but unfortunately we can't throw away the materialistic life on one day. To come out of this materialistic world we should watch the people who are down to us financiallly.We can practice some yoga, meditation and involving us in some social activities, spending more time with our family make us free and have a peaceful life
