Are you happy with your life in this moment in time? happiness for me is determined by many different factors. But to me you are likely to be more happy if you focused on yourself, rather than relying on the happiness of others. In this life you can never depend on someone else for anything. much less for happiness. happiness is a state/feeling of emotion within ones self. I define my happiness on my freewill to do things that i love to do. Such as spending time with my family, doing my  asactivites or going out with friends, and last but not least I love doing, learning, and reading new things. 

I love to spend the precious time that i have with my family on days off. My wife and kids put me in an emotionally happy state. wether it is just watching a movie on the couch, or taking the kids to the park. I couldnt see how anyone would base there happiness on the happiness of others. Dont get me wrong; being around happy people is very positive and would in turn make you happy as well. But some days you couldnt solely depend on others happiness for you're own.

Some days you might be feeling low and not to happy for some reason. wether it is because you have been fighting with your spouse, or something at work had you feeling down and upset. like i stated in the other paragraph. Happiness is the feeling of ones well-being mentally, maybe physicaly , or possibly spiritually. It comes from your own conciousness.
deep within to do the things you want.

It is not the family of someone else. It is you're family that makes you happy. for example if someone else was at you're house with you're family they probably wouldnt be happy with you're loved ones. That is because they dont know them. So you couldnt depend on the happiness of others to be happy.

All in all my belief  is that an individual must be focused on their personal goals and not the happiness of others to achive happiness.
