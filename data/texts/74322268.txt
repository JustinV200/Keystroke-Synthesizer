The first impression is extremely important. People form their opinion of what kind of person you are in the first few seconds of meeting you and if that first impression is not favorable it can be really hard to change the person's mind. What a person is wearing, if they smile, how firmly they shake hands, how they smell, all add up to the first impression. Certain things are assumed when a person has certain traits such as a person with tattoos is assumed to be a criminal or hard ass. A person with bad teeth is assumed to have bad hygiene, low self esteem etc. A woman wearing a low cut top is thought to be promiscuous. A beautiful woman is thought to be not as intelligent. A heavy person is thought to be unhealthy and often not clean. Wrinkled clothes tells people you don't care how you look and could indicate low self esteem or lack of motivation. I could go on but i thingk you get the idea. As much as we all want to believe that we don't judge by looks and only by their personality, that is not the truth. Even if you don't admit it, everyone makes assumption based on someones looks and that very much includes the first time you see them. I think it may have been an evolutionary thing. Back before civilization it would have helped to identify who was an ally or predator from a distance. It very much does matter. Many people maybe even unconsciously will see someone on the street and make that quick decision on if they are an "ally" or "predator". It is a part of human nature. This is why it's so important to make a good impression.
