Images and impressions have far to much of an effect on people. With the advent of social media, we as a society have become consumed with keeping up with other peoples' lives an adventures. Many people spend hours a day browsing vacation pictures someone has put on Instagram, new car purchases, selfies with a significant other, or new recipes they have cooked.  When they put down their phones, they return to their same house, old car, and tired kitchen unsatisfied.  

What people don't realize is that nothing is ever as it seems in a photo.  A photo or image posted to social media is just a one-second snapshot that the poster wanted to be seen. It doesn't capture the meltdown the family had on the way to vacation, how in debt the person is from the new car purchase, the fight they got into with their significant other, or the burned batch of dessert that came before the picture.  People become self-deprecating and judge themselves based on this skewed standard of 'perfection.'
Despite being told otherwise, we are so quick to judge a book by it's cover. We pass on a tried and true brand previously considered a golden standard because a newer product may have nicer packaging or a bigger ad campaign budget only to find that the new product pales in comparison.

Our mental health is negatively impacted by constant comparisons we make towards public figures and appearances put out on social media. Until we can learn to not give those things such heavy weight and significance and until we realize how truly blessed we are to have what we have, we will always be striving for the next best thing and will not ever achieve complacency or satisfaction.
