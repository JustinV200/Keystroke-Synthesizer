Images and impressions have too much of an effect on society. Everyone is always worried about how they look and how they are percieved. People are drawn to pretty things. Bright and shiney things tend to draw more people and a larger crowd. If everyone didnt care about how they are percieved they wouldnt be influenced by things that arent important.
 We give celeberties the power over us to sell us products that are more than likely not good. We follow others opinions especially when they have such influence over society. We flock to famous people like birds to the worm. If we didnt give them the power over society they wouldnt be famous. Blindly following someone that the majority makes you part of the crowd. Stepping away from the crowd is always seen as being the black sheep of the group. Just because you dont like something doesnt mean youre an outcast. If we all focused on the things that truely matter the world would be in a better space.
Bright packaging in the stores can often mean the quality was put into the packaging more than the actual product. I usually go for the store brand half the time because the quality is far better than the name brand. Why pay for the big ticket price when the quality isnt worth the money. People tend to gravitate toward the name brand only because society says youre broke if you dont get the name brand. If you dont get the name brand youre automatically labled as poor or not good enough. Society conditions everyone including children to bully people who dont have the name brands. If we focused on cleaning up the earth rather than focusing on what kim kardashian is up to then we'd save the earth for the next generations. So  yes, I do believe images and impressions have too much of an effect on society.
