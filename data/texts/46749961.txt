Is there any one way to define happiness? This is a question that has long been contemplated by many. It has always been my opinion that happiness must first start with the person. Only then can it be extended outward to others.

I believe that the pursuit of one's personal goals is a key component when considering overall happiness. Having goals gives one something to strive towards, which also gives one a sense of purpose in life. Once you have found your purpose, it makes you much more likely to be a happy person.  Once this is accomplished, then you will most likely be in a secure enough space to focus on the happiness of others.

There are some who may say that focusing only on one's own happiness is selfish. They believe that it is more important, in a sense, to cater to the happiness and well being of others. While I have no issue with this as a whole, I believe that it is impossible to bring happiness to someone else if you have not found it within yourself first. People have a tendency to pick up on things like this, and they would not want to be around someone who is not content with themselves.

In conclusion, happiness comes in many different forms and there is no one way to define it. My best advice would be to find a purpose in life that will ultimately fulfill you. This is what I believe to be the true path to being a happy individual.
