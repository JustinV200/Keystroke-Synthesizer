Happiness is something that we all desire. It is something that greatly improves our quality of life. I believe that happiness comes to us more when we focus on the happiness of others. Sure, it is important to strive for and achieve our personal goals. However, it is not possible to be fully happy unless you surround yourself with those that are also happy.

Science has shown that your environment greatly impacts your mind. Being around those with a positive mind and mood will enhance your own mind. I think it is extremely important to be kind to others and work extremely hard throughout life to treat others with kindness and to spread love. Only in doing this will we find our own happiness. When you're around people with a negative mood and negative energy it brings you down as well. I always treat people with kindness even when I am not in the best mood. My moods never stay low long.

So how should we go about living our lives? Should we follow our own goals and ignore the ones we care about? Don't get me wrong, following our goals is important in life but, in order to achieve those goals, we must constantly spread kindness and make the ones we love happy. That, in turn, will give us a happy life.
