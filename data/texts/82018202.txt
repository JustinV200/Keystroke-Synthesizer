some people happy to pursue their own goals. but some other people happy when they help other people to acheive their goal. some are happy while pursuing their goal , they help others too. i am happy when i help others and also pursuing my own goal also. so which is very important to acheive our goal, but we need to help others also.

help in the sense not only money but alos knowledge and some mental help there. we can give councelling to peoples who are very depressed and in past. so they can get some mental help from us. also we can teach younger people what we know in the free time.  by that we can share our knowledge to other people. 

from my point of view , we have to help others, by what we have. if it is very small help means, for them which is very big in their career. we can give our old and finished study materials to younger people. it may be very useful for them. we also can share our experience , what we have is enough. 

pursuing our goal also very important. than only we can acheive our stage in life. so doing our work is important. by the way we need to help others also very important. some peoples are more likely to happy when they are working to achieve their goal. mine is to pursue my goal while helping others.
