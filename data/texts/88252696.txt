Materialism what is the exact meaning of the word, is i am sure some one describing the word would be a viewer from the stone age people, accordint to me if your are good with some thing for a long time and suddenly some new way to do that thing makes that new way as materialism, most of the people found discomfort using materialism on new way because, they are well versed on old thing and the are happy with the way how the are think.

Hence people can spot on some crcitize that materialism is using more money and more natural engery and makes the world disaster, but i would say peopol with stupid hard worker who doesnt know to do smart work will not cope up with materialism, and another main aspect of the materialism is using time.

You can do work at short amout of the time using materialism, as a conclusing i would say people who criticize for modern society for being too materialistic, i would say the are more lazy than other people who are willing to change, final i would like to add that to sustain in this world you need to adapt on change, because "CHANGE IS THE ONLY THINK DOESN'T CHANGE".
