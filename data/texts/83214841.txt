Images are things that we perceive the world around us with, we have been seeing the reality around us with images ever since we first opened our eyes. People has realized this, and they now can manipulate to a certain extent that they can control us like a puppet without us realizing. These manipulative versions of the real product can cause people to spend their hard earned money on something that they definitely wouldn't spend their money on.

Eyes or sight is one of the 5 main senses of us humans. We judge everything around us relying on these trusty eyes of ours. If one can manipulate these senses to their will they might as well be a puppeteer and we the puppets. The reason why it is more of a problem that in the modern age of science and technology we are limited to the images that are provided by the sellers to us, whereas in a real market we would have the opportunity to utilise all of our other senses and judge it accordingly. And because we can't make use of out other senses this way we are very easily manipulated into spending money in things we don't need. The solution to this problem would require honesty and better moderation of products  sold by the sellers. People should learn to exercise self control in these cases.

In conclusion all is there to say is that images are huge part of our decision making process. We should learn to be more frugal with our money and not to fall in these traps set by the sellers.
