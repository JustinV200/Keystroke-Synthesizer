I think most of the people have both the sides of thinking based on their life. They can either be happy by others happiness or achieving their goals. 
But, I think it is more important to make other happy and get happiness through that. It makes our lives more satidfied than making the personal goals and making them achieve and then too we should work for it.
Even I too have a happenings based on this. One fine morning when I was walking to the roadside for buying some clothes to my friend's wedding ceremony. I saw an old lady who was in some search of one ring which is so much expensive. At that time I went and asked the lady where did you lost the ring. The lady told that it is lost sonewhere where I was talking with my friend. Then I was searching and found the ring for that lady. At that time she was more happily holded my hands and said thank you so much for this much more effort that you have made for me. 
This was the msot happiest moment in my life where that lady happiness stuck in my heart for than a year. That time when she saw the ring was mostly surprised and cried in a laughing moment.
I came to the home and told to the mother about the happenings that was happene during that day. She even came out with the joyness of the tears which made more surprised and told that you have done a great job to that lady. This moment made my day a greater joy with all kind of thoughts and feelings. I think this only makes us happy rather than focusing on the peronsal goals and making it achieved. So, finally we can conclude a result that happiness can only be given by making other happy.
