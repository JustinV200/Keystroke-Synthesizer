The average person is bombarded daily by advertisements, promotions in stores, and those in the public. This person can become easily confused by the things that they see because those in charge of promoting items or people are more focused on the outside rather than what is in the inside. 
A wonderful example of how this works would be all of the teen pop stars of the late nineties and early two thousands. Jessica Simpson stated in an interview that she was asked to lose 5-10 pounds so that she would look more appealing and more like Britney Spears. No one cared that Simpson had an amazingly powerful voice that was much better than those she was attempting to compete against. The publicists of these stars focused more on putting small brightly colored outfits on bodies that they forced to be teeny tiny and "perfect". 
Another great example is when I worked in retail. I tended to notice that we sold more of the shampoos that were in colorful or interesting bottles. The neon versions always sold better than the plain white bottles. 
It is always important, as the vulnerable public, to pay attention to the rest of the package. We need to look inside and take in all of the details so that we are tricked by those that are trying to sell their product to us.
