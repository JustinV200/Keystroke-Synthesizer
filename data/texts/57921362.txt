These days, a lot of people find value in objects that they deem valuable. Whether it's an expensive tesla, a fancy piece of jewelry, or even a blanket that their grandma knitted for them. Some would argue that owning all these material possessions isn't worth it - but is that true? Is it completely unnecessary to buy or own any of this?

Well, it depends. Some objects have sentimental value - that is, the value something has due to an emotional connection to said object. The blanket in my introduction paragraph is a perfect example of this. the person who owns that blanket likes it not only because it keeps them warm, but because their grandma - someone who they greatly care about - made it for them. Jewelry could also have sentimental value. A good example of this would, of course, be a wedding ring.

All right, so we got sentimental value out of the way. What else is there? Well, let's get the obvious answer out of the way - use. A Tesla, while quite expensive, does two things: uses electricity which ultimately helps the environment, and also helps the driver get from one destination to another. more examples, such as a stove, oven, and pans help you cook your food so you don't get sick. Essentially, objects that have a use have value in the way they help you in your day to day life.

At the end of the day, though, I don't think anyone should be criticized for what they buy or what they do with their money. If someone wants to buy 24k gold cuban chains, or some one dollar keychain, it's their choice. Is it the best choice? Maybe not, but if it makes them happy in the end, well, who are we to judge?
