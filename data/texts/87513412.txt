Do people achieve more success by cooperration or by competition? 

Cooperation implies working together or helping another to ultimately meet the same end or goal. Whereas, competition is more of a contest to see who will reach a goal first. Both of these are tried and true examples of how to meet certain objectives, as for which one is better to achieve success I say that they are about equal.

I have worked in environments that have been based on cooperation and the company as a whole had great success but the environment there was boring. I also worked at a company that used competition to get what they wanted from employees to achieve success and where it may have been more interesting, it lacked in co-workers bonding or friendliness.

So if it were up to me, I think that if a company were to utilize both cooperation and competition together that they would not only achieve success now but also in the future. If one was to truly reflect a will to cooperate with another as well as engage in open competitions that would elevate skill levels or bring in new and innovative ideas for all involved to achieve success. This would not just open doors for people already in leadership positions but also for those aspiring to be in leadership by giving them the opertunity to provide their ideas to others within the organization.
