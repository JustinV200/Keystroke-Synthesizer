Competition breeds success over cooperation; however, in this way it is the individual who benefits over the whole. It is human nature to compete and attempt to be the best, and that is done for the self, not the whole. 

Why would anyone try harder than absolutely necessary in their affairs if they will not reap any rewards from doing so? Plainly, most would not. Constant strain with nothing gained can eventually cause comtempt over placidity. People need to see that whatever they are doing is for a reason, that they are working towards something, as opposed to staying in the same place, always. The thought of every company's team, or any group working in the same space and for the same reason, all simply cooperating is nice, but considerably a fantasy. It is innate to want gains, rewards, and notice. A group of people working for someone above them, never having the chance to advance and doing what they do solely for the benefit of another individual, is unrealistic. Unless we are addressing a child's game of tug-of-war, where everyone must act equally, then it is useless to try to make anyone placid with the idea of never advancing. Competition creates advancement. 

We are never going to have cooperation because it simply does not work. There is always someone, actually many, who will refuse to settle into the masses.
