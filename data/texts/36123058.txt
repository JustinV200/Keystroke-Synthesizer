  Images and impressions have much an effect on people.
People are fall in love by first sight with each other, buying houses, clothes, pets and so on.
Apprearances must print strong images on people's brain. This is why clever advertisements create targeted favorable impressions.

  However, we need to be very smart so that we wouldn't only rely on the apprearances but would be able to see reality. There are a lot of deceptions and wrong messages out there in our society. We need to make correct judgment by seeing through the truth. We need to educate ourselves, try not to be ignorant.

  What really is should be more important than what we think we see.  Well, actually how things look like from outside and what really is are both very important. We should have great images and impressions as well as excellent contents and inner personality. 
 Both appearanves and what really is are very important and we should remember this all the time when we decided something.
