In today's society, I believe that people are more likely to find happiness when they help others achieve it. People have become more empathetic over the years compared to previous generations, and I believe that the mindset of finding happiness by focusing on their own goals is no longer the majority. I believe that newer generations are more likely to have a different mindset from older generations due to the rise and significance of the Internet.

Some may argue that focusing on other peoples happiness won't help you achieve it, but in my opinion that isn't completely true. Due to the significant rise of the Internet and social media, people nowadays are more exposed to the lives of others and the deeds that they do in the world. Many social media influencers show acts of charity and giving to the less fortunate, and viewers chime in with their feelings of happiness towards seeing this.  Even amongst my friend group, we are all very supportive of each other, and are even happier than our friend's when they succeed at achieving a goal. Being able to share and enjoy each others happiness brings about good mental health and in the end, helps us feel happier about our own achievements. 

In conclusion, I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others. People may argue that isn't true, but I believe that due to the Internet and the rise of social media, people around the world have become more empathetic. Sharing happiness with each other increases peoples motivation to succeed, and brings positive vibes to communities. Some may find themselves happier if they focus on their own happiness, but I think society today is more likely to find happiness if they look towards others.
