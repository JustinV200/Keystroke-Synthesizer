People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. When someone has goals, it gives their life a purpose.  Everyone needs to feel useful and productive. Everyone needs structure and a reason to get out of bed every day no matter what the goal. 

It is fulfilling to achieve something. It improves our self-image and confidence.  It allows one to live and not just survive. Our brains need stimuli and working towards goals gives it feedback and pleasure. It also provides growth and strength to our brains and our bodies. 

When people focus on their happiness, it allows them to become more amenable to others. Happiness can be contagious and being around happy people often makes others feel it too. They sometimes question you about the reason for your joy and might be seeking reason themselves.        

Happy people are often more considerate and caring of others. At times, people want to share their joy and help others feel some too. One might perform extra tasks for others solely because they are happy. This becomes a positive reinforcement for the person as they attain more happiness through their selflessness. 

In conclusion, people who focus on their personal goals will be happier in the long term because it affords them multiple opportunities to attain happiness and continue being happy.
