To achieve goals in everyone's life is important to be happy in their life and then only they can be stay focused to achieve their goal easily. And more important their family support is much more likely important as they lead a happy life. Some people get gealous of others life who is leading a happy life, it is very wrong behavior.

They should change their behavior, because of their gealously they cannot live their happy life with fulflillness. So people wants to live their life as possible as they can come over from their deppression.

In my opinion happiness is being with my family always, when we are going to tour or at any place with my family members enjoying together. Many people says is being rich and wealthy in our life is the happy, but in my point of view happiness is being healthy and staying together with my family is more happiness than being wealthy and other.

Being happy is important in everyone's life, because if any people stay happy, they can live their life with peace and calm. Happiness is the meaningful word for everyone's life. I need to grow my children with happiness enjoyment in his life. He would attain all his fullfillness in his life without any restrictions.
