                Adertisment has been around for so long we forget the influinces the have on us and our children. The advertisment inderstry  have done this in many ways and try to be snaeky in how they promot the items to us and our familys. they will us falshey colors or symbyls. I belive they work amazing on children and young adults, but every age group is effected by it. this ,akes us spend more money that we dont have or can spend on what we think we need. 
              
                The few ways they can and will do this like for children is add colorfull boxes and children playing and having fun at this activity, but usally only have a few parts you see on the box making you eather have to buy another item making you purchace more item than you intended.They will even add the most exspensicve ans child worthy things on the lower shelfs so it at there eye level so they can see and beg for the item. Like young boys will fly to the Ax body spray thinking they need to buy six to seven things just to take a shower so the girls will be all over them. Its no diffrent with the girls who belive they need make-up to be pretty or to fit in. We live in a genartaion of influinsers who dont even support the things they show just want the money for doing it, and the people go crazy over this the over spend there budget just to get this product 
           
           The advertisment buisness is bad and has to much power over the people we are thinking we need more products to be clean and to fit in when we dont we are just spending our money and making children with low self steam if they can not afford to allowed to  buy theses produts we all need to rember that the company just wants money not have your best intrest at heart so please stop buy all this junk thinking it will make you happy because it usally does not work. The advertisment images are way to strong and work well to well for the good or the bad.we are in a world of nothing but advertising
