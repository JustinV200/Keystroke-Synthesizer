People have their own personal views as to what brings happiness. Some people think it is due to pursuing their own goalss while other people foucs on other's happiness. I personally feel that people would generally be happier if they focus on their own goals.

Foucusing on your own goals gives better oppurtunity to bring happiness. You can focus on bettering your position in life so you can afford to live reasonably. You can put your effort into any hobby goals you have. People need to find some sort of purpose or meaning in life to be happy. Foucsing on goals to reach is not an absolute truth though. Happiness is relative and some people are truly happy focusing on other people's happiness.

Some people feel that it it best to focus on others. However, focusing on other's happiness has a good chance of draining your own happiness.  Some people will be unappreciative of your effors or even take advantage of you. Having children, if that's want you want in life,  is technically focusing on others. Although that is still fulfilling your goals and giving purpose to your life in some way. Your dream job may involve a lot of focus on helping other people. Being able to get your dream job is still reaching a goal. 

It would be best to focus on your goals to bring happiness in most cases. Too much focus on other's happiness can even be harmful. However, happiness is highly subjective. Certain people may still be happiest focusing on others.
