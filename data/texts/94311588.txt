We live in a visual world, more and more, people rely on just one sense to make important decisions. Unfortunately using only one sense is detrimental when making the right decision, and oftentimes we ignore our most important sense: common sense.When we look at something and we evaluate it, we tend to believe what we see. 
If people (consumers) absorb the visuals without taking into account any other aspect of a product, then indeed images have way too much effect on people. One example is when people shop at Amazon, there are countless reviews and social media posts about items being shown in a particualrly positive way. But when the customer gets the item, it was not as good as shown online. Not false advertisement per se, but 'enhanced' advertisement, additionally many customers only use the photos to make a purchase decision without reading the reviews. Another example is social media influencers; the most popular social media figures are the ones who have no discernable talent but are visually appealing. And finally, a last example of the effect of images and visual appeal is when we choose long-lasting items like a car. Many people rather drive a beautiful vehicle with stylish design than a dependable car with great gas mileage.
There seems to be a very extreme focus on looks, society tends to value superficial qualities over the content and real value of things.
