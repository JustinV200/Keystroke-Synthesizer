Happiness can be defined in many different ways.  All individuals are unique and what makes one person happy does not necissarily make another happy.  Happy is an individual feeling, a choice one makes for themself based of what they find important in life.
I personally feel that happiness is best obtained when one if focusing on his/her personal goals.  Someone can not be truely happy if they are always focusing on other people.  For example if I am always trying to make those around me happy by focusing on their wants and needs, I leave little to no time for myself.  The things that are important to me get pushed aside and I have no real sense of self or what my purpose in life is.  I cannot truely feel happy when I am unaware of my place in the world and am just existing to make others happy.
Some might argue that you can be happy when you are making those around you happy.  That focusing on others happiness is the ultimate selfless act and by doing so you feel superior and there for happy yourself.  But this argument does not make sense to me.  I think that people who say that others happiness is more important than their own are just lying to themselves or lying to look better in the eyes of others.
Happiness is a feeling that can't be measured or compared from one person to the next.  Each individual will feel happiness and measure it differently.  Focusing on ones goals and how to be the best possible version of yourself is going to produce a great amount of happiness for anyone.  Focusing on other's happiness might produce some sort of happy feeling, but it is not enough to last a lifetime.  Its the difference between surface happiness, and a deep rooted happiness.  And there is only one way to experience deep rooted happiness and it is by pursuing the things that are important to you!
