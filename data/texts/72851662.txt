Lions, wolves, apes, elephants, and bees are just a few of the creatures on earth that need cooperation to be successful. Without cooperation, all of these would not be able to fully function, live healthy, or be productive.  In order to be safe, social, and productive it is imparitive that humans also accept that our best is achieved through cooperation. When cooperating we see a united goal. A goal that not only benefits our own person, but one that benefits the entire team. 

Lions and wolves hunt in packs.  This gives them the benefit of strength, strategy, and safety due to the numbers. If one wolf or lion eats, they all get to eat. This prolongs the life and strength of the pack or pride. Humans too need to work together to feed themselves. While one person absolutely might be able to find a way to feed themselves off the land on their own, the best chance of survival is for humans to work together to make food for each other and reap the benefits of a healthy diet and time conservation.  

All pack animals use cooperation to provide security to all of its members. If one member of a pack strays off on its own, it becomes vulnerable to predators.  Humans as well work together to be safe.  We rely on people who provide locks on doors and windows, alarms on houses and cars, and police and security to keep us safe where ever we are. 

It is by laws of nature that cooperation has made us able to achieve higher and higher accomplishments. While competition allows us only to see what one person is capable of, it is by cooperation that we see the results of those capabilities. Our lives, our safety, and our happiness rely on cooperation just as it does for the animals.
