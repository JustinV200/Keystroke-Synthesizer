Nowadays, people are too focused on all the wrong things. Materialism is one aspect that we should deviate our focus out of as a society. We are too ingrained in wanting to possess items that bring us status or amusement. In this case, modern society has shown that their priorities are not in line with productivity and therefore we should criticize modern society for being too materialistic. 

Everything that we consume all ends up going to waste and cannot be taken with us throughout life.  We miss out on a lot of what life has to offer when we focus on all the wrong things. We consume our lives with material possessions that offer nothing more than temporary happiness and satisfaction.

Another con to being materialistic is the environmental impact of it all--we must create these material items that we consume heavily, and the production and manfucturing of it all leads to environmental stress. However, unless one works at these manufacturers, the common person is not aware of this, and society as a whole will continue to demand more and produce more, negatively affecting our environment.

As a society, we should make ourselves aware of the negative impacts we create on both our own personal lives and to our environment which we share. To criticize society for being materialistic is a necessary move to shake some sense into the people of today. The ideal circumstance is to instead find alternatives to meaning and happiness in our time, and shift away from total materialism.
