    Decide now on the superficial appearance of an object. For example, jackfruit is not good  to look at, 
 but if you inside, you can see how good it tastes. 

  The mood of the people today is changing. They superficially weight an object or people easily. This is 
 the problem of the people at present.People notice other than important problems. People nowdays are always entertained on social media. Those in the media pay more attention. 

    One has to evaluate whether an object is good or bad by keeping its quality. But current people do not do that. Rather they are judged according to their appearance. It is on social media that people are now losing their privacy. They spend more time focusing on social media.
  The covers of the items in the stores are just colorful and the items in it are bought anyway. This is the current state of mind of the people. 
Some ingredients are adulterated. If people use such products then only some problems will come. People do not buy blended material to avoid them.      

Items in colored covers are more appealing children. This is why it sells those products even if they are not of quality. This is the end.
