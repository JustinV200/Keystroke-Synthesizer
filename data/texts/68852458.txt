 Co-operation is the best key for success. In team work, we have to co-operate together. so that, they achieve their destination. Hardwork and dedication are the major roles of the success. In life, co-operation is the best role like family members, relatives, office colleagues and friends also. Without hardwork and co-operation no one taste the success and every people have a competitors outside.


For example, In office, team work is the best way to achieve success. In team work there are more than one members in a team. they work together to achieve the goal. So that they need to co-operate and adjust each other. Likeway, In a family the members of the family are need to be co-operate. From that only they gain happiness and smooth life. Competitors are playing a good role to achieve the success and it helps to reach the next level up.

If we did not co-operate each other, we suffer a lot in our life. If we planned for a event everyone of the event should be co-operate. Co-operation is the best way to avoid failure. Here, I declare that every succes are needs a co-opeation also have a competition to reach the success. Because without these two we cannot enjoy our success.
