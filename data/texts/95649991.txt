Materialism is more common in the present as technology has developed. It can be seen as we see more luxury brands emerge thanks to the internet. More people want what others have as social media apps give their users a false view of how happiness looks. Materialims is something that should be critizice. This materialism does not only affect people moraly but has fisical consequenses.

Many people would say that if you earn the money then you should decide how to spend it. I agree with the statement, but at the same time I think knowing when to spend and how is important. Materialism has made people over spend or not manage money properly. We see other prosper and want the same thing. The thing is that attention is put on what the person have and not what the person did to get to that point of economic prosperity. I think this makes people think that the only way to be happy is to be rich.

Social media has created a windows where its users can look and see what the idea of happiness looks. Many influencer show their followers pictures of them having a good time in expensive places, wearing brand clothing and driving expensive cars. They promote products that thir followers would buy and try to imitate that person that has it all.

What ever the reason that drives our society into materialism, it should be criticized. By critizing we show disaproveval in something that can be potentially negative. Masterialism is one of them. People want to imitate that they think happiness is.
