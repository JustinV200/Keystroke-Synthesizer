Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Often times we see things that are pretty or shiny and it catches our attention. We are all some sort of treasure hunter, constantly looking for the biggest, best, most shiny thing possible. It has to be bigger and most eye catching. It has to sound like what we find appealing, it has to feel the best. We are greedy and want as much as we can have for as little as possible, and when it is more visually appealing it makes it that much easier to want.

It is all a part of our natural instinct to be the best. Unfortunatly, a false reality in the perception of people, places, and things are the way we have adapted to be that best thing in this world. We have created a false reality to live in because it is easy and more fun. We do not have to face the reality that our food does not grow in packages or that our homes need to be built with skills we do not have or that drinking water does not just come from a river. Nor do we have to face most of the issues with illness that we did one hundred years ago. 

We vaccinate our children. We do our jobs. We go out for fun. We believe what we want to believe. All of this, so at the end of the day we can go to sleep in our clean, safe, homes that are exactly how we want. Choosing the most appealing politicians, shiniest bags, most expensive cell phones.... this is how we have adapted to survive. By doing this, we have created our own downfall. Without power and running water, most Americans would not be able to survive. We are destroying our planet and each other. All by being the best fake we can be. Being the prettiest and having the best is not what life is about.
