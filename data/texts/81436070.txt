Often there is a debate between the merits of cooperation and competition in regards to achievements. But upon observation, and meticulous analysis, it is clear that the only true accomplishments come through competition. 

Rivalry, conflict, and hierarchical stature is a key tenant of society and human history. Without competition where would humanity be? In some idyllic plateau? Forced to continually exist without technological or societal advancemant? Perhaps trapped in some sort of utopian paradise. Who knows because it is a simple idea sprung from imagination because it is impossible to know as competition has always be prevelant. 

Comeptition represents advancement. Competition is advancement. The use of tools, the grouping of villiages that turned to cities, technology, all are realized because of survival and competition. Going back to the earliest times, tribes of people competed against each other to survive. Competition was survival. It goes farther, even technological innovation is a result of competition. Eddison vs. Tesla. Microsoft vs. Apple. Ford vs. Ferrari. The desire to be better, to give a better product, to excel is ingrained in the essence of humanity. 

Also think about entertainment. Movies, television, video games, they all involve conflict. Why is that? It is because that is what people recognize and relate to. 

Now some people might say cooperation is better. But they're wrong. Sure the pyramids were built through cooperation, but you know what people call that nowadays? Slavery. And even still the root of achievment is competition from different socialial classes. The formation of cities: people cooperated because they were competing against other cities and people for survival. 

So in conclusion competition is the direct and indirect reason for most if not all accomplishments throughout history.
