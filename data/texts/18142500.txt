     To acheive success by competition seems to work for the individual who has been competitive all his life, but what about the individual who can or cannot achieve success by cooperation? The one who likes to play and cooperate with others in competitions with other like individuals. Two different methods to achieve a successful career, or not to achieve.
     The one who insists on being competitive has had that mind set growing up. Needing to succeed in all the games he tried. From hide and seek to football, he must be a winner, he must be on top of his game, always. The one who gets success or lack of success from the cooperation method was with that kind of mind set growing up. He cooperated with everyone in all the games he played. He was only agreeing to do what others wanted him to do and not thinking for himself. Therefore couldn't really be sure he was going to achieve success.
     The cooperation method to achieve success seems to have a 50-50 chance in my opinion. While the competition method seems to be on a higher success rate. The competitor will always thrive to be at the top and number one, therefore achieving success as if he were back in his childhood days. Competition is the only way he knows how to keep himself on top on the world, successfully, as the winner.
