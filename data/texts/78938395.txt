In this modern world, people may have chance to hate materalism because if everything is materialized there will be no job for the people, now a days people are depending on their salary, in this society it is very hard to find a job and to sustain in the same job for many years. We need money to live without money we can't do anything, people will criticize materialism because they are get affected due to materialism.
In my point of view materialism is good and using materialism we can consume less energy and time, but we simply can't leave people by affecting it, we have to take alternate steps to overcome it, we have to make different job opportunities to people by creating different job roles and we should try to solve that problem, If people get job opportunities they won't get lack of job, If they won't get lack of job they won't get lack of money, If they won't get lack of money they won't get lack of happiness.
People will be happy if they get enough money, so they won't hate materialism and people also supports meterisalism.
People are main source of the country and this world, If we satisfy them they will support anything we want, If we have to attain an certain thing we have pay for it, So we have to pay people by fulfilling their needs and its our responsibility to fulfill their needs and keep them happy. This is my opinon on this that people will hate materialism, If any flaws in written I am sorry for that, I have written in my perspective, This is my opinon about people may criticize modern society.
