If is often heard that happiness is achived by living your best life. Many belive that their best life is the following of their own dreams rather than looking to others happiness. It has become the accepted way in this fast paced jungle of a world.

I belive that happiness comes from puting others before yourself. If we all did this the world would flow so much better. Selfishness hinders the chance that we all can be happy. If we all put the happiness of the people around us in the forefront we would achive our own happiness by seeing their joy; them also considering others happiness first would begain a awesome chain.

We all have experienced the joy of seeing children open gifts or and old women get unexpected flowers. How about the joy you feel seeing a longtime hard worker recieve a well deserved reward. That transfered joy brings us happiness; although we are not the one getting the gift. We get happiness by way of the shared experience.

I acknowlege that many still believe that their happiness is self achived though what the personaly achive. If a empty life is their goal I suppose this is the method, but is one really happy if they have no one to join in that joy. Being selfish is not a path to true happiness but is a way to seperate one's self from the cycle of life.

So to get the most out of your life, seek the wellbeing of those around you first, and with good luck they will do the same for you. If we all do this selfless act we will see the world become a more caring place. So let's leave a marker in time, showing we can be happy and selfless.
