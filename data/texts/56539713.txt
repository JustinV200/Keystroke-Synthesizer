The answer for the question people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness or others in my opinion when a people wants to feel happy depends upon both their personal goals and also happiness of others. If a people feels like he or she can get happiness through their personal goals then he or she can focus on that if he or she get happiness through  others then he or she can focus on that if he or she get happiness on both then they can focus on both of them.
                   I would like to explain both here when someone focus on their personal goals they can totally focus on them and they get pure and total happiness of their own. There is no doubt the individual definitely feels that the happiness is because of them only. 
                   next let we see that when an individual focus on happiness of others. in this world there are lots of people who mostly focuses on other people's happiness and consider their happiness in to their own happiness. for that people when they focus on them it will make them happy as said it will improve the humanity. 
                  Hereby I am concluding that being happy is depends on both focusing on their own goals as well as making others happy.
