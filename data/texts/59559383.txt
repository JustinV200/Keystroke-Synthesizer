       My name is Freddie. I was born in Italy, My parents are moved Italy from United Staes at the age of 12. I was completed my schooling in both Italy and USA. My school days I was really angry in all of my studies. In my teen age I was fully arrogant and not study well at my age students. My Father was a Farmer and my Mother was a Housemaker. When I was 20 my mom and dad passed away in a mean time, so I was lived in my Grandmother house. 
           I have completed my schooling in a just pass in all subjects. Finally I was join a reputant company in my career as a Financial work as a supervisor. Some times my mind is fully deviated from my work as my memory about my parents. After some years I was promoted junior post to Assistant Authority of the company in Financial company. In my age of 22 I was married. It was a arranged marriage and the bride was my relative. Finally I was move forward my life with my wife in a long years.
          After two years of marriage I have two sons in my family. Some years I felt some problems faced in a modern society and they have treated me in a wrong way. Those are really materialistic effect in my family and myself. Finally I was struggle and move forward in a way of consuming some new stuff in a society about energy producing matter. These are my valuable things in my life. My wife was like to buy dresses and some shoes all the time in a society. So they are ever happy in their life because of  the family. some times I felt that my  family posses materialism and society goods in energy. So we have criticised than materialism and face to acquire at the possessions in correct way.
