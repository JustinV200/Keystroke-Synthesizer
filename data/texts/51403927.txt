This is going to change their lives for future and losing so many precious things and moments of their present life. And they won't be get back to that things as easy as possible because they used to this methodology.

By old days, peoples have worked to get food. And now they are working for their food, dresses, expensive stuffs, vehicles, travel, etc., And these are their main priorities to make their life luxurious and ideal one. They don't even thought of spending money as more as they earn. Again and again they are fonding for the new stuffs and new technology to own.

Finally, they didn't even think of or worry about their peaceful and satisfactory life. They are doing complaining about the system about meterialistic and also they are too becoming meterials. They should get to know that they are doing things like machines and and not living like humans. As they realise to not to be like machines, they should lead a happy and peaceful and satisfactory life. Also they can save their lives for their generation as well.

Modern life doesn't meant to be updated to the current life. And also saving and leading to the future of our lives too.
