     I do think modern society should be critisized for being materialistic. Today's society puts a lot, 2 much, of an emphasis on acquiring possessions and spending money.
     Our society has become wired for instant gratification. We now can buy about anything with a click of a smart phone/computer. This allows us to easily keep buying and trying to fill that void by collecting more possessions with very little effort. While society has always inundated people with TV and/or radio ads encouraging us to purchase the next great product or service, today with social media and smartphones those ads are always right in our face. It almost becomes something obsessive for a lot of people. Becomes like a drug, if don't get that fix of buying something new don't feel good about ourselves. Feeling as if have to have the latest and greatest all the time. IPhones are a great example of this, people getting rid of perfectly usable phones that are paid off in order to have the newest version year after year.  
     Don't get me wrong, I think buying nice things with hard earned money is fine and not something that people should be critisized for all of the time but when it starts to overshadow other things that should be more important it becomes a problem. People start to value their "things" more than family, faith, and work/purpose. What should be giving us meaning and happiness? 
     I believe there needs to be a balance between buying materialistic items and staying true to ourselves and focusing on making a positive difference in the life of others, a little more time spent on being selfless would be good for us all. We can't take all of this stuff with us in the end.
