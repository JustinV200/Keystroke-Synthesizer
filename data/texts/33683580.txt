The question of whether modern society should be criticized for being materialistic is one that should be asked of each of us.  To further breakdown the question, should each of us feel guilty because we enjoy having material things.  I think that anything done in moderation is certainly okay and should be acceptable for modern society.  

Material things make it possible for us to have an easier life and have time to do other things.  For example, should we still be expected to walk to work or take public transportation instead of owning a car and driving to work.  If I were to take public transportation to work it would add an hour of commute time each way.  Therfore the additional two hours that I save on the commute by driving my own car allows me to spend more time with my family.  

I do not think it is necessary to have the most expensive car or any other material item for that matter.  We must all live within our means and not go into debt so that we can have material items.   But in our modern society today, with everyone being so busy, we should indulge in material items that will make our life easier and save us time so that we can spend that extra time with family and friends.  We all need a little more comfort in our lives and having material items makes life more comfortable.
