I think it is based on the goals that they are focusing through their life. Goal is placing such an important victim in all the perspectives of their life. It should be fixed on every stages including at the age of 15. Every person should have their goals based upon their interest in which they are going to progress on it.
But nowadays people are mostly focusing only on their career goals which helps more in the organization. They should spent a lot in the achievement of which they want to achieve. Even I too have an example of  this particular aiming of the personal goals.
In my age of 35 when I was working as a human department resource in an organization they had a heavy loss in the company due to demand of the technology updating within the employee. So they thought to hire new employees who had new technology to be learnt. In that I am one of the person and I was got terminated because of the lack of new arrving technology. 
From that day I got an goal that to learn all new technologies more faster than it arrives. And I work hard to achieve that goal. It was very attentive and sportive for me to learn all the new techniques of the firms which I needed for a better position. This also makes my earnings more than the one that I have got before. Within a year, I achieved and rejoined in that same organization. Now I am working there for more than 35 years which made my goal a very new life. 
From that time to this moment I am enjoying a lot with all my firms, parents and childrens to the atmost happiness which I have by God's grace also. And I am now the CEO of that company where most of the technology rapids. So, at last I think it would be happy only if the are focusing on the personal goals.
