Happiness should solely depend on the person theirself. What makes one person happy may not make someone else happy. Everyone has thier own dreams and goals to work towards.

Once a person figures out what makes them happy then they can work towards setting up their own goals. Whatever goals these may be, they lead up to the happiness of that person. Even if they are small goals, they are worth working on for our own happiness. You can't rely on someone else to make you happy.  And you cannot compare your happiness to others. 

If we were to focus on the happiness of others we would only be taking away the joy from ourselves. What makes others happy will not neccasarily make us happy. This is why its important to have your own goals and focus on them and no one else. It is fine to be happy for someone else that is happy, but don't lose focus on yourself.  If we put our focus on others it takes away from ourselves. You may also end up more miserable instead of happy because your focus is on others and not yourself. Work on your happiness as you deserve happiness just like others. 

Even if a person does not have a long term goal, they can focus on the present and what makes them happy. Do what makes you happy and forget about other people. I personally feel that you should just work on yourself, have fun while doing so and do not worry about what others are doing. In the end you are the only one who is responsible for your happiness.
