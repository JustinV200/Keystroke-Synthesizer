How do you get where you're going, or accomplish your goal in the most efficient way? Do you work at it alone, or have some type of support network you can rely on? Most people prefer the latter. Why should that change in other parts of your life, like your job, or school?
Of course people will argue that without competition, there would be no way to recognize higher achievers. But why push anyone down? Pull the people who struggle along with those who succeed. This will only create more success. When we focus on those that have natural talents we are missing out on countless potential successes from people who just needed a little more help. When I was learning to read I struggled in the classroom. Seeing the charts and being compared to everyone else was embarassing when I struggled. I got into an after school reading program that worked as a group in class. At the same time focusing on individual reading levels to be worked on at home. We weren't compared to each other in any way. I read grades above my reading level after less than a year of the after school program. If you have mutliple people working as a team on a task, rather than individually in competition with each other, the results will not only come faster but also much better. Therefore, cooperation will always be the better method.
