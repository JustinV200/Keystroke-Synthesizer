In the world there are two types of peolpe. First one is people they achieve their own goals and make themselves happy. The other one is helping others and get happy. It depends on the mentality of people. People always don't have same type of thinking and all.It get varies with region, the way one raised, and many other factors.

Happiness is a way of living their life in their way without disturbing others for some people. But in reality, it wont bring them happiness. It will give only pleasure and there is a much difference between happiness and pleasure. People always fail to realise that in certain situations. 

Helping others at the time of one's need will give you happiness. That is considered as real happiness. Helping without any expectations will you real happiness. It doesn't need anything in return. People dont do anything with any expectations will feel this real feelings. This happiness is so pure and one who help other without any expectation will feel the same. They are good person with good heart too.

In a contrary, happiness could be found in doing our own work and persuing things we like. But the real happiness bound with helping others. Lot of people think their own happiness gives full satisfacion. but the real fact is finding happiness in helping needed people.
