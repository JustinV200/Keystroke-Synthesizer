I'd like to discuss the following question:  Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals rather than on the happiness of others?  I believe for the most part, people are happier when they focus on the happiness of others.  I personally feel more fulfillment when I have worked towards the good of humanity.

It should be recognized that setting goals of any sort, whether personal or for the good of humanity, and reaching those accomplishments brings a sense of joy.  If one focuses only on their own personal goals, the enjoyment can be shortlived.  It's important to accomplish personal goals, however, for true growth to be seen, you need to focus on others rather than yourself.  Focusing only on your own personal goals can bring joy but it can be fleeting.  Focusing on others, in my opinion, brings a deeper joy and satisfaction.  It's important to work towards helping others in order to really grow.

I think it's important to set goals in all areas of your life - from physical, emotional, spirtual and academically.  It gives one a feeling of accomplishment and purpose.  Without goals, one tends to flounder from one activity to the next. Setting goals brings purpose to one's life and provides opportunities for growth. Starting with setting personal goals is a good beginning point.  Moving on to goals that improve happiness to others is the next step.  It brings a deeper sense of joy and satisfaction to know you have helped others.  In my opinion, focusing on goals other than one's own happiness brings the greatest joy.

Thank you for taking the time to read why this is my opinion that focusing on the happiness of others brings the most happiness.
