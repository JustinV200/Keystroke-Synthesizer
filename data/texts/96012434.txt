What you see is not always what you get. We have heard this countless times, however, sometimes we are tricked by something that sounds or looks better than what it really is.

This holds true in many areas, however, today I will focus on one in particular. I'll be focusing on products that promise more than what they can deliver. I recently puchased an expensive vitamin supplement that promised noticable hair growth within 90 days. The before and after pictures looked believable and when your hair is thinning, you lose self confidence and are willing to try anything. I spent entirely too much and at the end of 90 days my nails were longer, my skin looked a little better, but the hair I desperately hoped for was not present.

This company did an incredible job touting their benefits with before and after images. They offered a money back guarantee so I felt safe. I contacted the company in hopes of at least receiving a partial refund or maybe even a coupon for a nice wig (that's a joke), but no luck. I let my guard down and put my trust in something I should have known would not work.

So, in closing, buyers must always beware.  Don't be fooled by beautiful images and packaging. Research and do your homework before spending your hard earned money. There is a lot of competition in this world and some companies will do whatever it takes to win your business. If it sounds too good to be true, well generally that's the case. Always go with your gut instinct because your gut is almost always right. Also, as long as you learn something from your mistakes, you grow and become wiser.
