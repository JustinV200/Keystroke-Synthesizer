"What you see isn't always what you get." Remember that quote? It's the tagline from the 80's cult comedy-horror flick "Gremlins." In the film, a young Billy Peltzer receives a cute and cuddly Christmas gift from his father: a Mogwai, which he nicknames "Gizmo." But, as the audience soon finds out, Gizmo isn't quite as cute and cuddly as he seems. After Billy accidentally breaks two of the three rules that come with owning a pet Mogwai, Gizmo births a pack of vicious, green monsters known as Gremlins, which proceed to terrorize his peaceful hometown of Kingston Falls.

Just like in the movie Gremlins, things in real life aren't always as they seem. Perhaps you've awoken late at night to hear scratches at your window, and quickly jumped to your feet worried someone was trying to enter your house, only to find the source of the noise was a simple tree branch. Indeed, our senses can often deceive us; and, sometimes, our false perceptions of the world around us can influence our emotions. Take fast food ads, for example. Have you ever ordered a Big Mac thinking, "Wow! Look at that plump, juicy-looking burger on the menu!" only to experience extreme disappointment when the one you ordered didn't look quite as tasty? This is but one of many ways our senses (coupled with some particularly clever advertisement, of course) can deceive us.

It's true the way we view our world is more often determined by the things we think than the things we actually know. In a way, we aren't really all that different from Billy. So, remember: The next time you see a cute and cuddly Mogwai (or a plump and juicy burger), maybe take a second to step back and ask yourself, "Is this really what I'm seeing?"
