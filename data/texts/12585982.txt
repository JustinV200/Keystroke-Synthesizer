Some feel that we are happiest when pursuing our own goals and interests, while others argue that true happiness lies in concentrating on the needs and concerns of others. I would like to argue in my essay that true happiness comes from focusing on others, and not on one's self. While our own individual interests may fascinate us, they can not substitute for human friendship, companionship, and company. 

What truly gives life meaning? Is it delving into those things which interest us the most, or forming relationships with others, and caring for them? Our basic needs as human being are not met only by ourselves, nor by information, hobbies, money, and activities. Rather, we are at heart social beings who long to be understood by and connect to other people. No matter how engrossing our plans for our lives may be, they can not truly keep us company, talk to us, or care about us. At the end of the day, there is only so much that one can learn and absorb about a subject, and only so much money that one can earn. One may reach the end of their life and realize that they are rich in experiences and knowledge, but poor in love, friendship, connections, or social bonds. 

But what about the argument the people deserve to pursuit their own interests and find meaning in their individual lives above all else? Certainly that is important, and hobbies can indeed and do give some meaning to life. But hobbies can also be enjoyed as one loves and cares for other people, and instead of being a goal unto themselves, can serve as meaningful islands of private time to recharge, and give one the strength and calm needed to return to social obligations and to others' concerns. Similarly, the money we earn can be used to help others, enrich our communities, and buy gifts of appreciation and friendship for those we care about. Objects, while enjoyable in and of themselves, can not love us back, nor can they benefit from our humanity and personalities in the way that we can benefit from one another. 

What of the argument that some people are simply better off alone, in their own world? After all, not everyone is outgoing, and some people are shy, and form relationships only with great difficulty. While this is true, even very shy or retiring people can and do find meaning in connecting with others, and while we all connect in different ways, shy or reserved people have much to offer the world that can not be properly shared or appreciated without human contact. One does not need to be an A-type personality to care for others, love others, or help others. In fact, the challenge of overcoming shyness to interact with people can prove far more rewarding for a naturally shy person that the enjoyment received from being aloof and absorbed in private tasks and hobbies. One need not be loud or obstrusive to be a good friend, neighbor, or spouse. Additionally, one can find ways to help and serve others even from a distance, by donating money or goods, by writing letters of encouragement and support, or by calling and texting those who are in emotional need. 

To conclude, our lives have their greatest meaning when shared with others, and while hobbies can give us joy and entertain us, a truly meaningful and fulfilling life must also include friendship, connections, and an authentic sharing of ourselves with others. All of us long to be understood, and to be heard. The ultimate fulfillment of these longings comes not from objects, wealth, or ideas, but through friendship, service, caring, loving, and reaching out to others. While hobbies can give us a refuge and an oasis of genuine enjoyment, they can not substitute for human relationships. Life�s meaning is realized most fully not alone, but with and for others.
