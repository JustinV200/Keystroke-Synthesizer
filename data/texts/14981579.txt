Be careful what you wish for. That's what i was told growing up. And boy is that true, especially in todays day and age. Things are not always what they seem. Buyers remorse is more rampant than ever. Things don't always match what their descriptions say. People don't always turn out to be who they say they are. But image is everything. And it does have too much of an effect on people.

Now i'm sure there are people out there that will say that maybe those who have issues with that should do more research about the things they buy or the people they vote for. And sure there is some hint of truth to that. But at some point we do have to realize that descriptions and people false advertise all the time. And no amount of research could fix that. Especially when it comes to those we vote for. They can say whatever they want to get elected but it does not mean they'll actually do it.

"Dont judge a book by its cover". We've all heard it at least once. But image is everything whether we want to believe it or not. First impressions matter. Packaging for products portaying how things work do effect our perception on whether or not we would buy a product. the way a person portrays themselves and their ideals does effect whether we would vote for them or not. Because again, image is everything.

In a perfect society image wouldn't matter. But the reality is, in todays society, what you see is supposed to be what you get. And that's just the cold hard truth. Most humans are visual beings, meaning what they see is what they believe. We bank on what we see matching what really is. And if we see something we like we're more apt to buy it or vote for it. At the end of the day image leaves a lasting impression whether we want it to or not.
