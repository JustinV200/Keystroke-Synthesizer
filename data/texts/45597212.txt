          Start from the childhood, we always told to be competitive in this competitive world. It's not a bad thing, but, also the important thing to achieve the success. Eventhough, it is important, the main thing always considered in many industrial or business success are related mostly to the cooperation.
          The cooperation might be a simple word, but, the main factor that concludes with perfection in the group projects is the cooperation between the workers. A leader should make the progress based on that to improve the healthy relationships between workers. A sole person could be the head for anything. But, without his team, he is nothing. The business or industries works with this functional process. If we consider an example for that, A big company project is presented with the team members. The project's value not only depend on the leader perspection. The team members who makes it possible with their hardwork.
          Considering that, the cooperation means all by the communication between them. The work's progress has many steps. Each and every step is important to see the ending without the errors. Only the cooperation makes it happen at the very end. It's always better to be in a teamwork rather than working sole process with in the mind of competition.
