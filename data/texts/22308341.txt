 In this modern times we dont have much more time to spend with our friends, families and our collegues. If we need to work peacefull means get together with our collegues but that is also rich that we cant buy in this modern time. Lets think we have more jobs and less time to complete monthly needs to make up for our family and ourself . There is no space for others. 
on my friend daughter funeral i want to be with him more and share his condolences but my busy schedule made me a materialistic to go my job more than my friend.
I spend myself to my family but my wife and daughter spend it on more branded things and she want a new series of electronic gadgets , bags etc... I want to escape from this kind of materialism. because their happiness only depend on those names. I myself also hated to the fact consuming more and more stuff. So materialistic gives some people happiness and some people their life depend on them. so we need to escapefrom that type of illusion its like some kind of virtual reality. Needs to overcome and support who need our help. 
On concusion, Yes it should be criticized for being materialitic.
