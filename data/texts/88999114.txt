     In today's fast-paced internet world appearance is usually rated over substance. Flashy ads or short videos with entertaining visuals are displayed to get you to believe in something or buy something or like the video so the creator gets revenue. This has the effect of causing the viewer to not reason as much when thinking about important issues.

    For instance, political ads usually focus on style over substance with short blurbs and this can cause the populace to rely on images and not facts to make decisions on their voting.  News sites use flashy headlines and photos to get hits on websites (and thus more ad revenue)  and there is little in-depth analysis to provide the actual news so instead of people getting facts they may just get commentary from a particular website or newsite.  I believe this is having an effect not only in the United States but worldwide of dumbing down people to some effect just for monetary gain of the creators, websites, networks, etc.

  Some may say since deep reading by the general public is not as widespread as years ago due to educational system changes, television  and internet use during the past few decades and now visual media is the new way to inform the public. There are some benefits to mainly visual communication such as graphical comparisons and actual photos or video from real events happening now that give the viewer a more impactful reaction of matters going on in the world today.

    My take on this matter is to make use of both visual and written materials when trying to come to a conclusion about candidates, events or even products and not just rely on flashy videos to make quick decisions on political decisions or current events or even when deciding to buy a product. This though requires more thought than just meekly watching videos and not delving into the facts more deeply by reading about things.
