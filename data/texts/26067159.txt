                                                                              HAPPINESS

                The people mostly happy when they fullfill their goals and also when they serve for others thats also gives extra happiness for them. If they working for their goal they are more concentrated and they take the risk as very easy. with that they get some of the fullment . The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are.
                I give one example for this . I have a goal on to become a singer , I input all efforts towords it . once I realise the value of the goal I have much more confident, and focus. Its leads me to learn a new skills. So I become a singer lyricist ,dubbing artist, etc.
                I like to work in the NGO . because once I went to buy the things I want. On that time I give some food to the poor child . The child smiles makes me to fly on the air . That happiness never comes after . So both happiness are, happend in every humans life. The humans sometimes, if they not understand or feel in this , They definitely experienced in their life time . So in my perception the real happiness is MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY AND MAKE OTHERS ALSO HAPPY . This is my life time code word . My suggestion is If you have the change to make someonne happy, just do it. Sometimes people are stuggling silently. May be your act of kindness can make their day .

                                   HAPPINESS COMES FROM OTHERS AND ALSO FROM YOU
