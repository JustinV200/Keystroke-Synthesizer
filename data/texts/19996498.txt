The question at hand is; do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people? Is is wearing brighter clothes giving off the impression of liking some one more?? Why are impressions more important then the actual facts about certain person? Here in the next few paragraghs that will explain those key questions at hand. 

One of the main of the events is reading through social media, TV, or even streaming services. Everything is made to look good, or make it more deiserable for that person to want to learn more because they want to be a certain way to actually fit with in socitey. 

When you use your soical media, there are some people that you actually might now in person and how they actually act in real life but act totally different on soical media to make themselevs look perfect. That is a form of impression in order to be liked by others. 

Another example that just happened recently was the Depp vs Heard case. When you watch their movies you think of them as that person that the acted and it becomes reality. Or the way the media advertises them to be this great person and have a great life as a celbrity. But in this case and trial it brought to light that they where just like everyone else. Examples of abuse, fights, drug addiction, actaul life struggles that the average person might be going through right now.  

Not everyone is prefect, life is life and it happens. Images and impressions are having a huge effect on people. There is this need that you can't be flawed, or make mistakes. This then causes people to have mental break downs or even have that lack of accountiblity when another person calls them out on a lie. We as people need to start excepting ourseleves for who we are and not worrying about what everyone else thinks.
