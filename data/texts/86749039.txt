Happiness is desired by everyone in life. There is none who does not want to be happy in life.We all are running through our lifetime only for achieving happiness. Happiness is completely correlative. To someone happiness is only achievement of resources. Again there are a lot of people who don't think that. To them happiness is not about achievement of wealth.


Many think happinesss is the quantity of their wealth. They think that the more wealth they earn the more they will be happy. But actually the happiness is not like that. It is about the happiness of others. Real happiness is stayed in others happiness. Happiness is about all live together happily.


If someone do not think about others, he may achieve much wealth in life. But those wealth can not bring to him happiness. Because who do not think of others mainly he is alone in his life. His loneliness will hit him a lot in life. His loneliness do not let him be happy though he has much wealth. But if he do not concentrate only to him but others he will be happy with all. Because happiness is relative and it is stayed in the thought and work for the welfare of others.


So the happiness do not stay in self-centeredness. It comes to life when someone dedicates thyself for others.
