I think that happiness come from a healthy combination of focusing on your personal goals and the happiness of others. Personal happiness can come from achieving goals that your work towards, giving you a sense of purpose and achievement which is vital to self-worth. People who are important in your life also contribute to your happiness when they also feel a purpose of self-worth and achievement. However you cannot let the lack of happiness of a loved one ruin your own happiness. 

Your own happiness comes from accomplishments that you work towards throughout your life. As a child, this would include mastering a new skill, creating a piece of artwork or making a new friend. As we age, our goals change and so does how we view happiness. Through out our young adult life, happiness would include buying a new car, getting a promotion and finding love. When we miss out on one of these life milestones, then we feel inadequate and unfufilled. We are left in misery that a part of us is missing.

The happiness of others also greatly impacts our own happiness. As a child, if your mother was stressed and upset for her own lack self-worth then you would pick up on those feelings and transplant them upon yourself. This would cause you to put her happiness above your own. As you grow up the happiness of your spouse and children come to matter and affect yours. How can you be happy if your wife or child are miserable? However, if your wife is always upset and unhappy reguardless of the situation, if she would refuse to take the help that you offer, or find joy in the small moments despite the overall situation, how could you let her make you miserable as well? 

Happiness is a balance between personal goals and the general happiness of those around you. Life is a balancing act and happiness is included in that.
