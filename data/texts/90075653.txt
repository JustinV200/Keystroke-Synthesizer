People love having material things and can receive positive feelings when they purchase and acquire a new product. Modern society, more than ever, promotes materialism and makes it seem that having more and more means you are happier. Modern society should be criticized for focusing too much on materialism.

Most people can be happy if they focus on experiences and their social relationships. Society makes people think that material goods are important but it's not really linked to true happiness. Most people would be happier if they spent less time worrying about having more stuff. In addition, if you do not focus so much on material stuff, you can spend less time working, which would lead to a happier life. Some people feel the societal pressure to work 60+ hours per week and this is probably leading to stress and overwhelm. You don't need to spend as much money as you may think by observing others on social media (e.g., Instagram). Focusing on living life rather than acquiring more things can be better for your overall mental health and well being.

In conclusion, having material items is not necessarily correlated with being more happy. Society has created this false narrative and this should be changed. People would do better to focus on things that can truly make them happy, like love and independence.
