Happiness is something that everyone wants in their life. What is the best way to achieve it however.  there are many different approachess to happiness like pursuing personal goals, while others believe that making others happy will lead to your own happiness. I personally believe that making the effort to make others happy is really the true way to happiness. 

Being happy is subjective to each indiviual person. By ensuring that others around you are happy, this gives people a sense of satsifaction and contentment. Making an effort to make others happy generally prompts other people to return the same effort. It creates a group of friends and family members that look out for each other and support each others needs. Which should lead to happiness for everyone in the circle. 

Only pursuing your own personal goals and dreams may make you happy in the short term, but for long term happiness, it just doesn't work. What will make you happy if you achieve all your goals? And at what expense did you working only towards your own personal goals cause your immediate family? For example, if it made me happy to work towards my dream job, and I had to work long hours to do so, my husband and children would not see me, and I would create unhappiess and stress in my home. Which would in turn make me unhappy even though I was happy working towards my goal. You can never achieve true happiness that way. 

All in all to be truly happy with your life, you need to work towards making others happy. It will create an enviroment that not only helps you be happy but makes sure that everyone around you is happy too.
