You see a photo of a clown with a big smile on his face, children are around him laughing and playing. This image is fun, it might make you smile or feel nice looking at it, and it leaves that impression upon you, especially if you are young and vulnerable. This image in question was associated with the vintage Mcdonald's commercials and it is one that I think about a lot and compare to with my current feelings and knowledge of the world. Underpaid employees without benefits, mistreatment of animals and other corporate abuses were hidden behind this clown's face all along, and people unwittingly will turn a blind eye to these things for a cheap burger and feel good attitude.

A simple read of the label can at most times reveal a product for what it is, but majority of consumers do not even bother. They are drawn to that colorful photo of a kangaroo on a bright purple shampoo bottle and think "it looks flashy and nice, whatever is in here must be good too". Little do they know, a lot of these products actually will end up damaging hair in the long run, with added dyes and fragrances that can harm skin.

The same can be applied with people, no matter how bad someone can treat others in the background, they can publicize that one million dollars they donated to charity and all the bad is blurred away. In the eyes of the entertainer we are all very easy to fool, and the masses will believe whatever is told to them if it is on television. Nowadays a lot of consumers aren't as easy to fool, and even search beyond what they can see to find new products at cheaper prices thanks to the internet and easilly accessible information. The future of business will have to adapt to these challenges, and can no longer hide behind affiliate company names like they could before.
