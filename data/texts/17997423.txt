Do images and impressions have too much of an effect on people?  I would like to induldge on this for a couple minutes and see if images do in fact leave a effect on the people that are viewing them.  These images and impressions could be from a number of different things but yes it will have some lasting effect on us typically in one way or another.  

I do believe that they do effect us espically images and impressions just from a marketing standpoint.  We all have our favorite commercials or ads that we see that will either leave us laughing, sad, angry or happy.  But they typcally leave something with us even if we hated what we saw, you will still remember what it was and why you did not like it or why it upset you.  Just look at superbowl commericals, they spend stupid amounts of money on the right time slots when they know most people would be watching and they dive deep into their marketing campaigns to leave you with a commercial that will leave you wanting something from this company or brand.  Another example is President Trump, his image alone on any scale and subject will send some people over the edge with hatred or excitment.

As you see above I was able to briefly give a few examples of why I believe images and impressions sometimes have too much of a affect on people.  What we see in everyday life affects us in one way or another and typcally will stay with us atleast for a short time.  Different images or impressions typically will trigger something in your brain to remember what you saw, wither it is a postive or negative reaction, but most people will still remember what it was to a degree because it effected them in one way or another.
