People are more likely to be happy if they work on helping others no matter who they are.  These acts for others should not be criminal or hurt anybody or anything as this will diminish the outcome. This could include the happiness of animals as that can be a  satisfying outcome.  Working on personal goals is not likely to be as satisfying as helping others as it does not include empathy for another which is part of creating happiness. Helping others also broadens ones perspective because others are different and view things differently which broadens an individual.
    Having empathy involves thinking about and investigating others and what they need to flourish and be happy. This is part of the process that creates happiness for the original person. It should emcompass talking if possible, observation of the other for a period of time perhaps a day or more. Maybe interacting with others that know the individual and getting input from them.
    Having accomplished this investigation of their original subject the happiness seeker  should now spend some time putting together the information about their particular individual to come up with ideas that will make their subject happy.  There may be many or just one idea.  
     And having coming up with actions that will make the other happy they must put the idea into action and accomplish the goal they have come up with.  The presentation of the outcome may or may not ellicit joy and happiness from the subject  that hopefully will last some time and the originator will feel the happiness and remember it to their own benefit and possibly go on to do it again for someone else.
