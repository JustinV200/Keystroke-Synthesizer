I can relate to both side of this argument.  Being involved in a career of human resounces for many years I have seen first hand the results of both a very intense competative workforce vs one with the sense of cooperation which can be  ingrained in the employees.  Competition occurs within a sense of minus side results, where the task at hand cannot be accomplished if the rest of the team does not complete it.  The same can be said for an opposite way of thinking, with respect to a sense of unity and team effort;  Cooperation happens on the plus side if everyone is on the same team working toward the same end result, ie. success.
   I know that for many folks, the idea of over acheivement , especially among ones coworkers is the number one focus in life.  Competition is ubiquitous , and not just as work.  Just look around ones schools, gym and while traveling.  Experienceing a robust competiton while at the same time comparing ourselves with each other, we gather the skills to become successful and to increase productivity.  But on the flip side, cooperation achieves this as well as well, but probably more so.  As a company's workstaff come together into a coagulated whole with a concerted goal, the team is much more likely to increase production, become innovative and advance in more ways than any manager could hope for. 
    I feel cooperation includes everyone, and competition only exists because of cooperation.   Therefore, in my observations, cooperation benefits the majority but competition only satisfys the individual.  Competiton is beneficial ONLY if it leads us to cooperation.   Cooperation can exit on its own but competiton does not. I hope this satisfies the turk requirment.
