Happiness is an individuals state of mind. What makes one person happy may not be the same for another.  Defining happiness can be as simple as looking out of a car window while on a trip with your family.  It can be extremely hard to find for others.  There are levels of happiness, from a bit to bursting out of your skin with happiness.

Being happy has been said to be overrated.  There are those who prefer to never to happy with anything or anybody.  The opposite can also be true.  There are those who are always happy no matter their circumstances or life situation.  A constantly happy person as well as a person who also only see the negative in every situation, can be difficult to be around.

Happiness is a state of mind.  Being happy is a choice.  Do I chose to be happy today?  Is there a reason to be unhappy?  Will I be happy if I spend every dime I have or will I be happy by having saved every dime I have earned? Does happiness depend on me or those around me?  Do I depend on myself to be happy or expect someone to make me happy?  Expecting someone else to make you happy often leads to disappointment.  Surround yourself with things and/or people who have positive outlook on life.  Negative thoughts and behavior are not conducive to happiness.

Everyday I make thousands of decision, some are conscious and pursuing happiness is one of them.  Will I make someone elses happy by the choices I make?  Do I have a concern if those around me are happy?  If not, I should be.

Being happy makes the sky bluer, the grass greener. That  is  what I am choosing today.  My family's happiness is paramount to me.  My cat's happiness is also important.  Happiness isn't just for humans.  Your pet(s) should be happy too.
