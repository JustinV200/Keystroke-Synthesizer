People are more likely to be happy when they are pursing their own personal goals. The question is what is the root of happiness? This may seem different for many people, but it's ultimately the same for everyone. It only looks different because there are different things which make different people happy. 

People are inherently selfish. Many people like to believe that they are happier when they are doing things for other people, but the truth is that they are getting an emotional return out of the things they do for others. So, even those who think they are pursuing a goal of improving humanity, are still, ultimately, pursuing their own personal happiness. In short, they are happy pursuing helpful or utilitarian goals. If people focus on making others happy and they don't see that others are, in fact, happy due to those efforts they may be disappointed or even become depressed. Other people's happiness is not possible to entirely control, but personal happiness can be controlled much more easily. 

In all, happiness is something personal and will vary greatly among people. Even though trying to make others happy is much harder to achieve and can lead to disappointment, the process of trying can lead to happiness, which is a pursuit of a personal goal. So, focusing more on personal happiness will more likely lead to happiness than focusing on the happiness of others.
