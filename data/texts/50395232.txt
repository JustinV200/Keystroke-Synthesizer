In my opinion, people achieve more success by competition. In our daily life, we face competition and cooperation a lot of the time. We have the common sense that we would need to compete with others at some point of our lives, like contest, school, athletic activities, etc. In the meaning time, we learn that we need other people's help too. We need to cooperate with others to achieve certain goals when we are in a group. 

I think that in order to achieve more success, competition is very important. It is the fundation of success. If there is no competition, there is no victor. In a game, we need to compete with others to succeed. We compete either individually or in a group. Most of the time, there is only one championship. We need to realize that competition is the only way to get the championship. At work, there are very intense competitions between companies, business partners, or even between coworkers. It helps us to grow and do a better job. In order to be successful and be the No.1, we are more motivated to be more efficient and do a better job.

I understand that cooperation is necessary when we need to make things done. But competition is the most important part to drive people to be more successful. It is the way to be the best.
