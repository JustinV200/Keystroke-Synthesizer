Happiness is a conglomeration of bodily sensations and fleeting moments of elation. Though it is coveted by all, it's fleeting nature assures that happiness does not belong to anyone forever. Billions of dollars have been spent on trying to understand how to be happy and what makes for a happy person and life, and yet the simple truth of the matter is that happiness is an experience rather than a goal to pursue. 

Take for instance, the last time you went to bed without feeling sleepy. Though you had to wake up early in the morning, trying to fall asleep was futile because your mind and body were pursuing the goal to be asleep. But sleep does not come when you follow it closely, sleep comes when you are otherwise occupied. Similarly, happiness is not a goal we can covet as it is like sand that slips through our hands. The monks say that desire is the root of pain, and the let-down from not "being happy" can be attributed to simply that. By simply focusing on someone else and their happiness, we are not guaranteed to be happy. In fact, we are never guaranteed to be ahpyp because such is the nature of life. 

To people who would argue that we can be happy by helping others, we found find ourselves in a conundrum when people are not natural givers. Not everyoone wants to serve orthers, some find happiness in their own desires. Alternatively, wanting happiness and going after it sets us up for a let-down when we are not happy. 

Therefore, in conclusion, I state that happiness is an expereince and not a goal that can be pursued. It is never all present, and will not linger forever.
