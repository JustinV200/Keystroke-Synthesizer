The most important goal i want to achieve in my life is to get married and be a happy family.
Ever since i was a little get i always tried to imagine my wedding and my perfect life after marriage.  There is this part of that me can't wait for me to be settied and have someone close to me that cares about me.  But there is another part that has this fear of giving up my independence and not being truly loved.  From a young age. my parents would say, "this is your temporary home, your real home is your temporary home, your real home is with you husband." is with never really understood what they mwant util started understanding my culture and religion.  My religion says that a girl should be willing to get married.  But my culture thinks that if a girl doesn't think i would ever have found anyone for my self.  I imagine my self being sucessful in my career but living with my parents. by not having someone depending on me i would be about to travel the world.  I world be about to travel the world. I would be about disappointed in myself because i realize how important marriage is to my parents. I can imagine my self seeing my  happy important marriage is to parents. I can imageine myself seeing my siblings happy with theirseeing my spouses and children and secretly hoping i had my own as well i would love my independence. The love your family gives cannot be compared to the love a spouse and i would never get that. the advantage of not getting would never get that the advantage of not getting would mean i fulfill my other dream of having a professional being free. i can imagine my self being very happy when i'm married. I have never had a best friend that i could trust with everything and to have a best friend living with me would give me comfort security and advanture. and to have a best friend that i could trust with everything and to have a best friend living with me would give me comfort, security, and advanture i can imagin my life.
