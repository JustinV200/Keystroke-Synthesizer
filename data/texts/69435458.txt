The feeling of happiness is different for each individual. Happiness can come from many different things. Some may find happiness after achieving their dreams or from materialistic items, while others may find happiness through others. I find that happiness comes from within. 

Accepting and knowing who you are is the key to happiness. People cannot truly be happy if they are not happy with themselves. I don't see how someone who is not happy with themself can find happiness through others. Those that find happiness in others are those that have found happiness within themselves. If I was struggling and unsatisfied with my own life, I would find it difficult to be happy for others. For example, if I was unhappy with myself and struggling, I would be less likely to feel happiness donating to those in need when I am not happy myself. If I spent time focusing on myself and my own goals, I would feel more confident and that would lead me to be happier. When I am happier with myself, I would be able to find happiness in others.

Whether people find happiness on their own or through others, I believe there is no wrong answer. Finding happiness is what makes life worth living and whatever makes someone happy is up to the individual.
