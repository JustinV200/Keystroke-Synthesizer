     Materialism is not necessarly a bad thing. If people like to acquire things that they like they may work harder to get them. If a person really wants a nice car and that is there goal they may go out and try to find a better job or take a second job to make more money. When they are motivated they may find that hard work is a very good thing to acheive what you want. 
     Most people have goals in life to acheive sucess and a lot of these things some people would consider materialistic. If a person wants a nice house for his family some people would call them materialistic. But is this really a bad thing. Some people would like to eat at nice restaurants but is that a bad thing. If a person does not treat themselves for working hard than what is the motivation to continue to work hard.
     I think a lot of people that criticize people for being materialistic are actually lazy people who do not want to work hard. Therefor these people do not have a lot of material possesions and instead of trying to work harder it is easy to criticize other people than to try to work harder and get more things for themselves. 
     A person only lives one time so if buying something material makes them happy who are we to criticize them for wanting to acquire it. If a person wants to live a simplier less materialistic life that is up to them but they should not criticize other people for wanting to have nice things in life. 
     So in conclusion modern society should not be criticized for being to materialistic. Acquring things a person likes in life can be a motivating factor to work hard in life.
