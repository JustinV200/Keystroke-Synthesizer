Yes, people are more likely to be happy if they focus on theri personal goals because all are living  for their success and happy to lead thier life. But also our happiness is not happy for all time we are consider other happiness also give happy for some time. we thinking ourself is little selfishness and consider all other peoples who are very close in our relationship. All are have one dream they focused to run on their dream but some poeples are not put the effor to achieve. Helping of others is give an happiness. Me and my friend walking at road after the class. My friend saw a oldman suffer. She decide to help so he go front of the oldman and ask do you need any help. But the oldman not talk with my friend. We are confused at the same  time and also but our leg is not move front becasue of humanity. Then we talk with the action then we understand he is very hungry so only he did not have strength to talk with ours. We buy the food and give to the old man. The old man eat the food and say thanks. We both are very happy. The little happiness of other is create happy our mind and heart. We achieving the goal at time not hurt others.
