Is fighting to earn your place at work really the way to go? Competing against your co workers or even your friends is actually feeding your rage. When you are on the edge constanstly it sends your body into over drive which can lead to all kinds of health issues. It is healthier to work with everyone around you. 

I work in the type of enviroment where you either get walked all over for having work ethics or you are not considered a good employee. The two different types of people seem to always be at war with one another, when in reality they could all do equal amounts of work and have a better, less hostile work enviroment.

Working as a team increases productivity and morale. People should be moved up or advanced because of special skills they have not because they can do one thing better than someone else. When people are put in an enviroment were they are pinned against the other they do not flourish.
 
Everyone in the world has something special about them and if we spent more time just working together and focusing the goal, people will naturally fall into a line. I don't believe in comparing myself to others or competing with others because at the end of the day we are unique and work in our own special ways. There is no I in team.
