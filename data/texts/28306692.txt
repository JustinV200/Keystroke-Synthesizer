No, modern society should not  be criticized for materialistic behavior. America runs on capitalism and is an exchange of money for goods and services. Materialism IS capitalism and criticising it is degrading one of the core aspects of America itself.

Many people over-consume, which is something that should be looked down upon (depending on the severity and circumstances). However, materialism and overconsumption are not the same thing and it is used interchangably, at times. A family of the five may obtain a three bedroom house by means of working hard to get it, which could be materialistic based on perception from person-to-person. However it is import to note that not everyone thinks the same nor do they know what circumstances another person is going through (or went through) to get what they have/want.

On the other hand, people are inclined to overindulge based on selfishness. The same family of five that was mentioned earlier could end up in 12 bedroom home. More people would see this as problematic. But that's when materialism goes too far.

At the end of the day, materialism is based on perception. Perception varies from person-to-person. Should overindulgence be criticised? In some cases, sure. Should materialism, as a whole, be criticised? No. What counts as materalistic to some may be considered as a basic need for others. It doesn't make a person's perception correct.
