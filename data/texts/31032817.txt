Many people are conflicted by personal goals and working for others in finding and maintaining happiness.  Sometimes this is referred to as work - life balance.  This problem, as variously experienced by different people, can have a tremendous and formative influence on life choices and the perception of ones direction in life.

In truth, happiness may best be found when ones personal goals align with the work one does for others in a satisfying and reciprocal manner.  This is as much true in families and relationships as it is professionally or in the workplace.  As such, even in focusing on the well-being of others, an individual might experience a sense of self liberation and happiness in the broadening continuity and expression of the rewards of such motivations in the lives of those whom they help.  Or, a person might work very much alone, perhaps as an artist or musician practicing long hours and composing music, but in producing quality work of personal value, they create value for others that resonates in a unique way that in effect furthers the common good through a validation of the human experience.  An activist might work on environmental issues, through great adversity, but be happy for being in close contact with nature, and with the knowlege that their work benefits all of humanity and life on the planet. 

Some may feel that personal goals and the happiness of others necessarily exist in conflict, and are opposed.  But often conflict exists when personal goals do not align well with a meaningful purpose that affirms the continuity of lifes motivations in connection with others.

So self knowlege is the key to happiness, a tool for learning, and a proper basis for sharing in lifes experiences.
