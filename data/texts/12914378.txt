 Images and impressions have a tremendous effect on people and society today. The first thing anyone notices is the way something or someone looks. People from all walks of life are judged on how they look, dress, and their social standing within their community. This in turn boost the economy with frivolous spending of items that have no value.


With this need to look better and be better; cosmetic surgery, hair extensions, fasle lashes, tatoos, etc. is at an all time high. Even men are wearing make-up these days just to cover flaws. In front of the camera, how you look has a major effect on how many followers you have and how far you go in the business. Flashy and colorful content and pictures draw the eye to want to purchase and own a piece of the pie; may it be a car you make payments on and can't afford the gas or a dress you buy and leave the tag on it so it can be returned the next day because you need the money back.


The way someone looks should absolutely be no reflection of a persons heart, spirit, and mind. Our communities and possibly the world would be a better place to live.
