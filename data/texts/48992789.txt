Happiness is a feel that can be achived only by inner peace. Achiving inner peace is the thing we all run behind these days. It is harder to find peace or happiness when we don't even know how to feel those things. We all obesse with our wealth, look and social status in this we forget that our mental state suffers and we lose the happiness we all search for.

No dream can bring happiness to a person no other person can bring happiness in life. The moment a person accepts that no matter what they do they are not going to find a better place. The place they are in right now is as best as life is going to get is the moment they will feel what is to feel happy.

Sure some dreams are worth persuing but the truth is as humans we lose sight of what is worth persuing as soon as we start the journey we get distarcted start comparing overselfs to others. Either we grow inferiority complex or superiority complex and forget the dream. Life is distracting mess the clearer the view the happier the person is. To be really happy dream simple fell the happiness in small victories, don't hesitate to share the happy moments to others. Only a person who lived on the moment and enjoy the small things can say he lead a happy life. So failer or victory it will pass run and be glad that you had the opertunity to run that is happiness.
