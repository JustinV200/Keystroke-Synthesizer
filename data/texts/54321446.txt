I think images do have to much of an effect on others.  I think when we see others and make decesions based on just impressions it's very bias.  I think it's important that we actually think of other ways to have a certian impression on a person or people.  I think images often times do not do justice with others and fake images are put on from others.  I also think sometimes when we strive to be like others we only look at the postivie qualities and think that we are not good enough when in return, a lot of these images people put and impressions others put forth, are indeed fake.

A lot of people are not who they act like they are when you are with them in person.  Those people seem to put on a fake image per say so they look and see like they have an attractive personaity etc.  I think there was unique ways we can prove and show our self impression of ourselves to others.  You can be yourself and understand people should accept you for who you are not for who you act like you are or want to be.  

Often times we put fake images and when we do this, we completely lose the fact of who we are.  We try and shoot to be somebody who we are not and we get upset and and want to be like this person which in turn, never makes us very happy.  I think also when we try and be like something we are not, we love ourself in turmoil and we aren't who we actually want to be.  We are shooting to be somebody we are not which is not healthy.  I think often times, we get stuck in these images of who we "want to be" and we lose a lot of respect for ourselves.  We need to understand we are all different and we all have unique things to us.
