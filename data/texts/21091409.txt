Cooperation vs. Competition?  Some would argue the former is better for the individual and society while others would argue the latter is.  Many claim competition brings out the best in them, but that argument is problematic since earth has billions of inhabitants and competition usually is behavior trait which strives to benefit the individual above all others.  

God made human beings to be in community and cooperate with one another.  If competition were to be king that would mean every society, every community, every work space, religious space, etc. would constantly be the individual vs. everyone else and total chaos would ensue.  To ensure a functioning society we must share resources and working cooperatively together brings multiple perspectives to tackle compelex problems which increases the likliehood of solving said problem.  If one is always competing against co-workers, neighbors, strangers, etc. stress levels stay high and productivity will decrease over time.  So constant competition wears on mental and physical health and strains relations with others.   We are designed to work together cooperatively in give and take throughout life to get things done and benefit as many people as possible and to maintain a stable society.

History shows us that successful civilizations were built on cooperation.  The United States is an example as people from different backgrounds and walks of life came together fought/won against the British and collaboratively formed a new government and the country is approaching 250 years of existence.  This would not have happened if it was simply competition without cooperation. Yes, individuals may have to sacrifice what they want for the greater good of the group, but that is necessary for survival.
