According to me competition, with other people or with an opponent must be in healtheir way. Because when a competition begins with two people, there will be a achievement engerness will increase automatically. 
 
At the same time, because of the competition only people are becoming angry and jealous on others. It is very much bad habit. It will definitely not give full success. We can not work ful fully for our achievement, we only work for their not to win. 

For example, in a company every single worker needs to cooperate for a success of that company. If a single worker will have a disappointment to worker with the company, the company will not get the success ful filly. And also the other workers will not get their working interest properly. So for a full success everyone needs to be in cooperation for the company.

If wew take a player as a example, not only the players contribution will be bring the success to him. Everyone around the player such as his friends, his family, his trainer and also the co competitor has a contribution in his success. So, for a person's success is not only the success of that person's success, it also the whole surrounding of that person.
