Misleading or even fake advertisements are a huge problem when it comes to the human condition. Of course businesses and companies want to sell their products first and profit off it instead of others, but most of the time that leads to more and more exagerration in their advertising and manipulating the customer. This is a terrible trend and not just limited to physical products unfortunately.

Public figures, politicians, and mainstream media are driven by the need to appeal to the lowest common denominator of the population. As Trump put it "I love the poorly educated." Why does this matter? Critical thinking must be a crucial part of a person's character, if you will.  The better one's Critical Thinking skills are developed, the more chance one has to be able to use logic and, frankly, common sense, to be able to tell if the claims one hears or sees, are true or highly exaggerated. If it sounds too good to be true, it is fake news.

Unfortunately in today's ultra-connected world-wide existance, and 24 hour streaming "news" channels, even mainstream journalism cannot be trusted some time. Online and TV is driven by advertisers and here we come full circle. When a "news" website is driven to do anything they can to promote traffic to their page to drive clicks and ad views, they will make more and more outlandish andeven fake claims in their articles or programs, just for the sake of sensationalism. To get the consumer to click their page or tune in to their program. Does it matter if the claim is true? No. But after the consumer clicked onto the site, and was able to view the advertisements and therefore provide revenue to the site, does it matter? No.
