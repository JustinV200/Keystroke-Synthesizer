 Materialism.  We see it from the time we are old enough to say, "My stuff is better than your stuff".  What we have or don't have, can boost our positions and status on the ladder to peer envy and success.  It also makes parents dread seeing bills and bank account balances each week or month.  Modern society is often criticized for what they have or do not have. Every person has a right to material things; however, if it compromises the welfare of our families, our homes or the very possession it self, hard work achieving these material things is far more stressful than status elevations.

Families often have children screaming for the new video game system or the best in bicycles or other popular items.  Many times, parents delay purchases of other necessary items, such as tires for a car or a new roof on a house, to give children what they see on television or other places.  There is very little left, unless families live on credit cards. With high interest rates, parents only bury themselves in more debt.

There is always something that needs to be repaired or updated in our homes, so next to the children who want the best toys, and yes, even the parents want the best toys as well, until a repair most affecting the home or vehicle is out of control.  Then we sit at our tables with our credit card bills and home utilities suffering for late payment and often, that dream car is no longer possible.

In the end, the pressure and stress of always having to "keep up with the Jones'", cause stress in the family dynamic and can leave children feeling guilty for all the sacrifices their parents make for materilistic attitudes and parents exhausted crunching numbers at the end of the month.  Please, teach your children gratitude when the highest prices are burying parents in debt.
