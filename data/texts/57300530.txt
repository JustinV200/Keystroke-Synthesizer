In my experience people achieve more success by cooperation; it's called teamwork. When there's strong, direct leadership, a team can accomplish any task they set  out to do. Also, if everyone follws the game plan, the job will get done and get done in effectively. Competiton is more like indiviualism; person x is only concerned about what person x has to do to succeed. Person x may only do as much as he/she needs to excell and will not consider anyone else's needs.

A great example of how cooperation is more effective than competition is team sports. Although there is competition in team sports, there is also team work. And in some ways team sports is a good example of how both competition and cooperation leads to success. When the team works together, follows the strategy the coach laid out, said team has a better chance at overcoming the oppostion. 

Unfortunatly, some team sports do support indiviualism over cooperation.

The same works in the military. There is no room for competition in any country's military. There are soilders, captains, generals, majors, corporals, serjents..etc. Each one is on the same team and each one ( from the foot soilders to the commanding general ) has a role to play. In the military, there is no room for "me, myself and I". And I think the military is a great example of how success can be achieved via cooperation. If one soilder falls, or is injured, another steps in the assist him/her.

Competition has its place, but only for indiviualists who only care about themselves.
