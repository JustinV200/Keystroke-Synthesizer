In this essay, we will be focusing on the topic of happiness, and whether individuals are more likely to be happier pursuing their personal goals or if they are happier when they are focused on pursuing goals that creat happiness for others, and humanity as a whole. 

In my personal opinion, I believe that happiness or the state of attaining a happier version of ourselves through helping ourselves and others is crucial. But if I had to choose which philosophy I would go with, it would have to be us focusing on goals that would make us as individuals happier.

I say this because, when we are focused on solely carrying out tasks for others and going out of our way to make everyone else happier, it does not neccessarily make us happier all the time. For example, if it was our birthday, marriage, graduation or any other event that was meant to celebrate ourselves, and we were solely always focused on ensuring that everyone else is satisfied and happy, though we may feel good about it in the moment, we start to realise over time that we have to push down our own negative feelings and situations in order to maintain a happy environment, thus creating a toxicity within ourselves which does not allow us to work on them or sometimes even acknowledge them. These things could inherently cause us a great deal of depression and anxiety, or they could build up and turn into the burden of depression and anxiety, just to name a few. It is not sustainable to survive this way.

Though we should learn to acknowledge our problems and negative situations, we should not always be focused on ourselves and our own happiness, as it can cause us to be selfish, selfcentered and narcissistic. So there needs to be a balance in all things.

To conclude, there should be a balance. We should not only focus on our own personal goals all the time, and we should not always focus on solely making the happiness of others our priority.
