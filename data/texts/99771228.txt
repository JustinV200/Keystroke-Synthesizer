I believe that images used by most media sources have a negative effect on people. These images are doctored to show a better than possible product. This leads to disapointment in what you're buying or even yourself. Companies should be creating better products instead of better ways to alter the ones they're selling. 
Doctored images don't stop at the burger from your favorite fast food restaurant that also extend to models and celebrities. Numerous celebrities have come forward complaining about their image being changed for magazines, advertisements and social media. Things like slimmed waist lines and enlarged breasts. This tends to happen more heavily with women but men are also on the recieving end. Justin Bieber complained about an often used image of him, saying they added muscles and changed his general shape. Celebrities are already under extreme pressure to maintain perfect bodies and this just creates more pressure to achieve an unachievable body.  We're so desensitized to seeing unrealistic portrayals of the human body that when we do see any imperfections we tend to overdramatize their existence.
As a woman it's hard to always be striving for something thats unattainable. I try very hard to only shop at stores that have real women models. Not only does this make me feel better about myself but it also makes it much easier to buy clothes seeing what they look like on an actual person.
I understand that every business wants to put its best foot forward and attract the most customers but I truly believe this should be done in a more honest way. Take the best possible picture but do so of the actual product not some Frankenstein monster of the original.  The strength of your product, outfit, sandwich should be enough to keep customers interested, not a false version that leaves them feeling cheated.
