Materialism means believing the things which the person see and he or she believes everything which he or she naked. The answer for the question modern society s it is also should be criticized for being materialistic is yes in my point of view this is because when we start to criticize something there creates some awareness among people because just believing what we see is not totally wrong but not that much good it is somewhat bad.
                            when we are totally materialistic it is easy to cheated by others so it is not that too good and that is not too bad because when we believe something which we see is sometimes good because somethings which will not affects us lots when we believe at times. so it is good in some situation and bad some situation. 
                           The opposite is being spiritual it is also not too good because it is totally believed on god it will not always make us good. as the situation speakes either we should be materialistic or to be spiritual. as given materialism s acquiring possessions and spending money it is avital source of meaning and happiness in our time. so we should decide according to the situation in my point of view.
