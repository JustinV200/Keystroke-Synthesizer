"Materialism: it's the thing that everybody loves to hate." Is a statement of near fact in many scenarios. "Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?" Is a valid question, as well. Most individuals would agree on at least a surface level that materialism carries a negative connotation. And, in American society at least if someone calls you materialistic -- it is usually intented as an insult. 

Why would materialism be considered an insult in a country where consumption is so integral to our being? The goal is to get a job or build a career that makes you well off at the least, and in turn able to purchase all the things you've been wanting in your life. Those things are usually materials. So why should we criticized for the one thing that most people have in common?

One may argue that we should not. We live and operate ina world where your possessions are almost essential to living. In these days in time, you can't really operate in too many places in the US where you can get around regularly without having a vehicle. Fashion is such an integral part to a lot of what American culture is - and therefore, even the clothes we wear and use as expressions of individuality can fall under this umbrella of materialism. 

On the other hand, one may argue that we should be criticized for being materialistic. We live in a world where there are so many people that go without -- so many people that do not even have the basic human necessities to survive. So, why would or should it be okay that people put so much into acquiring excess? One may argue its quite distasteful and disheartening.

In conclusion, it may all depend on your outlook on life and in what ways you interpret values and humanity. We all should just try to be and do good. Whether it be decided modern society should or should not be criticized is not the big picture. The bigger picture is how do we fix the problems in modern society?
