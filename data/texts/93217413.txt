What does it mean to be happy? Some people try to find happiness through jobs, others throgh material things. In some cases people believe that happiness is achieved through spirituality or through the aquisition of money. Are we happier if we focus on our personal goals, or is it better to worry about the happiness of others? I believe that happiness comes from focusing inwards and working on yourself.

How can someone attempt to bring happiness to others when the goals that they set for themselves falls by the wayside. A lot of people at the beginning of the year set personal goals for themselves. There are financial goal, fitness goals, spiritual goals and relationship goals. I have personal experiance with getting to the middle of the year and realizing that I haven't stuck to the goals that I set out for myself. When making steps to achieve personal goals and crossing the mini thresholds there is a sense of accomplishment and happiness. It's as if our brain gives us a hit of dopamine. 

While there is merit in focusing on the improvement of humanity there is only so much that can be done with the resources available. Adopting a child, feeding the homeless, volunteering at food banks or donating time and effort to a cause are all valid things to do for others. The bit of others happiness brings vanishes once the validation is no longer there. In the end, this reminds me of Maslows heirchy of needs, where before you can focus on things at the top of the pyramid, the teirs at the bottom need to be worked on and met first. In my opinion, our happiness is the same, first focus on ourselves for happiness, then we can try for the happiness of others.
