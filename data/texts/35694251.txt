Materialism is inherent in modern society and that has promoted freedom and prosperity. The seventeenth century philosopher John Locke referred to this phenomenon as acquisitive individualism. Acquisitive individualism, which most people simply call materialism, is the foundation of Western liberal society. 

Materialism enables people to pursue their individual goals. A society that allows individuals to be materialistic prospers while creating the circumstances that also promote individualism. The eighteenth century economist Adam Smith described this process of individual materialism as an "invisible hand" that promotes both the welfare of the individual and of society as a whole. Materialism has thereby become the engine that powers the modern market economy. The freedom to pursue materialism also fosters a tendency toward self-government.

History shows that the most materialistic societies are usually also democratic. First world countries are characterized by high income per capita and elected representative governments that protect civil liberties.  Accordingly, the materialistic pursuit of individual well being makes first world countries into the richest and most democratic of countries.

Critics of materialism abound. They attack materialism from a variety of perspectives, particulary religion and ideology. Religions tend to argue that materialism causes people to become alienated from social and spiritual desires. Collectivist ideologies argue that materialism catalyzes human exploitation and inequality. Critics are correct that materialism has its flaws. 

Yet materialism is better than alternative approaches to society. It has created the greatest prosperity and freedom for the most people in history. Societies that attempted to be governed by religion or morality achieved less prosperity and much repression. History vindicates materialism as a way of life that does much more good than harm.
