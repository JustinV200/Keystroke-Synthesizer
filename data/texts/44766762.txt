Materialism usually comes along with negative connotations, and in the 1980's especially materialism was seen as sought-after and trendy however; it also was the catalyst for greed, self absorption, and the importance of wealth above just about anything else. Which created unhealthy obsessions, habits, and unrealistic goals.
The negative aspects have led to many disadvantages to society as a whole and these reared their ugly heads starting mostly in the 1990's. It led to unfair goals and standards placed on people by themselves to attain more and more high priced items, many of them uneeded. The most harmful of all of the voracious desire for more and more led to unhappy people who could often not attain their impractical goals. Unfortunatley this paved the way for the heroin and opiate and prescription drug epidemic of the 1990's and 2000's. 
Some feel that materialitistic tendancies led mostly to shopping addiction and social media addiction, in some cases this may be true, however delving deeper into the effects of materialism studies have shown that people who could not live up to their goals of money and expensive items have often turned to drugs to numb the pain. 
So materialiasm is definitely a more dangerous attribute than just craving the limelight and monetary items and the status of extreme wealth,
