we all live in a flashy world where everything is advertised for better sales these ads mostly end up deceiving people from quality goods we all can clearly see but we do not accept that good and well developed brands do not advertise those who advertise are mostly brands or companies that are growing they all give falshy ads that is not the original product they have a ad sample that is good looking mostly it is created artificially to make us believe that their products are actully good and they use these to trick us to buy their products.

they provide their products with colorful bags and flash us with gifts that make us feel we buy more and our purchase is reasonable,these are the ones that make us fools they make their ads by bringing celebrities who we all like but they get paid and they are doing their job for money but the final product's quality is questionable while some do it honestly there are few who do these ads just for the money they make people fools by making them buy these local goods they have made it a custom that people are now thinking that those goods are actully good and are buying those goods mindlessly.
