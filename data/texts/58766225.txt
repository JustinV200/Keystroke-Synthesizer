It totally depends upon the person or individuals mentality. Everyone have there own thinkings upon this and everyone is right in their own prespective. For someone achieving their goals like buying house or car makes them happy, on the other hand some people will be happy by helping the poor, needy, friends, employees, brothers, sisters, relatives and others people.

According to me, people will be more happy when they care about others happiness and try to make others happy. If they achieve certain goals in life then that will make them happy for some days, months or even years. Also if they achieve their goal then they start making new goals and struggling to make that happen and this never ending cycle goes on. So we have to do the things which lasts forever that's gonna makes us really happy.

If a person wants to be happy for long run then they must help others in achieving their dreams and makes them doing what they like. This type of happines is the one once should have. Being a person I would love to help others and I become more happy if I make someone happy.

As my favourite quotes states that,
                                                                 "Happiness is to do love and to be loved"
