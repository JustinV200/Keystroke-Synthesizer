Materialism is something that keeps modern society prosperous and thriving, but it is also the very same thing that can be unequal, depending one's position in life. One of the important aspects of materialism is capitalism that is frequently beneficial to the average consumer or producer. How far can one go to be critical about materalism, considering it has a important place in society?

Our world has come a long way from the days of how much a person acquires and materialism is one of them. It is the very thing needed in modern times to live life comfortably or to provide happiness by the things we own, how much money we make, and our social credit with others. We are born in this world where materialism exists and often propped by the media and the ultra wealthy. Many people often secretly or openly look up to those with certain amount of wealth and have the desire to want the same thing, which can also breed more materalism. 

It is also important how we look at materialism to understand our relationship with it. Taking it to the extreme often leads to inequality, including wars and greed so it is very important to have a healthy mindset where materialism doesn't rule our lives and give a chance to look what other values we possess to live a balanced life. Values can include building necessary life skills that goes beyond material things. If all materialism cease to exist, then what would we have left? A good critique on materialism is fair but at the moment, it is something that we often need to keep society running.
