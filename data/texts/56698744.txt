People are more likely to be happy if they focus on other goals:
                               Most of the adults are not aware of what they are doing, what we are studying, for what purpose we are living etc., They even dont know what is our life. What we are doing in this world. They are happy in spending time with friends, playing online games, watching tv, sports event etc., 
                               Most of them are guided by parents, teachers and their guardians. They choose what the kid is going to study. What is good for their future.
                                We even dont know what we are belongs to. If we understood all those things our half of the life are gone out. We always live for other members in this society. Some of them are live for themself. It is most crucial. We love, care, share all emotions to other members. It is life. 
                                All persons have feelings. If we focus on our goal, our life was not fulfilled. Our supportive members they know what we like, what we do in that situation, how we are happy by that moment. So choosing others goal is most prosperous for our life.
                                If the person choose his goal without any guidance, it may be give overconfidence to them. It cause failure for themself or other mistakes may be happen to causes because of their carelessness. Having proper guidance for such age limit is good for our life, our work, our family etc.,
                                 I strongly support that my fathers goal makes me proud, successfull life, Good partner, strong guidance by them. Now we are all happy together. Life is sharing thoughts.
