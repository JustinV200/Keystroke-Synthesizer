There was a time when things were more simple and people were judged by thier actions and believes rather than what they own.

Moderen society is too materialistic.  Too many people are focused on getting more and more stuff that is not needed.  It wasn't long ago that people were happier with less material items.

Things are so easy to order and so much is avaiable that it can be overwelming.  I see people just order random stuff from thier phone and later complain that they can't aford something else and ingeneral they are not happier.  A gereration ago people had to take more time to get things.  You would actually need to go somewhere or maybe order by phone or mail.  This gave you more time to think about how you spent your money.  Things were less stressful and people were happier with less material items.

Some would say material items are a necessity for modern life.  I would say they are a distraction from what is important.  If for some reason these material items are no longer available or don't work people would be lost and not able to survice.

This is why I believe modern society is too materialistic and we should return to a more simple way of life.
