 Materialism, why are so many of us obsessed with accumalating a lot of money just so we can go out to spend it on materialistic items that many people can only dream about.  Why do humas work themselves ragged because they have to have the latest and coolest items? Parents work overtime so that their children can reap the benefits of material items that they were never able to have as kids themselves, only to spoil them and giving a of feeling entitlement.
 There was a time when life was a lot more simple, you farmed your own land, built your own cabin, raised your own farm animals, traded with neighbors, and whatever matrial items you owned were a neccessity. People appreciated what they had even if it was very little, children learned how to work hard and respect their elders. In todays world things have changed, you may work hard but pay for every material item you've been convinced to buy. The more money people have the more things they want to buy, of course this is all helped along with constant advertising, videos on social media pages and so forth. Famous actors, sport stars or well known media stars trying to convince us that whatever it is they're advertising or own is the next best thing. Of course we want the next best thing too, so we run out work hard again just so we can go and buy that new BMW, the fancy boat, or the latest technology available. 
  Human life has turned into a rat race, will we ever be able to turn away from all the materialistic things and go back to appreciating the simpler things in life? Will we ever be able to slow down again, take a breath and step away from all the materialistic items that we really don't need? Will we ever be able to truly and deeply appreciate life without all the fancy materials?
