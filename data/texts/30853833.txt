It seems that today's society is obsessed with have the "latest and greatest" of everything. Consumers are happy to wait hours in line for the latest Iphone and pay outrageous prices for celebrity-designed shoes and clothes, sometimes purely for the bragging rights.  However, consumers should not be criticized for being materialistic. From a young age they are bombarded with commercials and other advertisements telling them that this will elevate their status, possibly make others jealous, or be lavished with compliments if they have certain products in their possession. In other words, an esteem boost to those who may need it if that kind of thing is important to them.
However, maybe this not the ideal that society needs to strive for. Sometimes it seems as if too much value is put into appearance and material things and not into anything of "substance", whatever the perception of that may be. Some may feel that current society places less value towards non-material things such as a person's character and what they give back to their fellpw man to make the world a better place. But, this point of view is also based on what the person sees as a valuable asset and may vary from person to person.  If a purchase makes a person happy and causes no harm, what is the problem? A materialistic society also bodes well for the economy in many cases.
In conclusion, modern society should not be criticized too harshly for being materialistic. It is something that becomes ingrained at an early age and can be a hard habit to break, which could explain why there are so many books and blogs dedicated to getting rid of material things and sticking to the basics.  Minimalism has definitely been a popular topic lately.  Life is short and people should do what makes them happy without worrying about judgement from others.
