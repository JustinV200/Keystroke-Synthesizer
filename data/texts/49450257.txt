There is a saying I have heard for years, People are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.  Some of the happiest people I have known have expierenced traumatic and difficult life situations.  These people have an optimistic outlook on life despite their dire circumstances. 
I beleive happiness comes by pursuing my own personal goals AND by focusing on the happiness of others and improving humanity.  Setting personal goals and achieving those goals is self-satisfying and therefore produces feelings of happiness.  Being kind to other people and making other people feel good about themselves also produces feelings of happiness.
The act of setting goals for oneself and being kind to others are both positive acts, which both evoke feelings of happiness.  Feeling good about oneself by meeting personal goals creates happiness.  Making others feel good about themselves in turn makes one feel happy. I do not feel the two actions can be separated from the other.  Being a positive person and focusing on positive things in life naturally invokes happiness.  I have found people who focus on the negative things in life are usually unhappy people. I have also found negative people tend to want to be around other negative people.
