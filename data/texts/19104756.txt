"First impression is the best impression", we all heard this from our childhood. We try to make our first impression to be the best in all scenario. Infact, that is what, we are taught to. People can merely judge others at first sight, eventhough that is not going to be the same in future.

The impression doesn't going to work on one side. It is a two way process. The way you look and the way the person looking at you. We can find one's true nature by getting closer to them, not by just looking at them. The images the other people shows, must not possibly the same as they can pretend well to be that way. 

People now a days started judging a person at first sight itself. But later they will feel bad about their behaviour with others. Because, not everyone is going to be the same as they look. People who realized this, wont judge anyone at any cost without any proper and valuable evidence.

The real character of the person can't be simply assumed or judged. It is a long term process and hence it will take more time. Just because a man has a poor look doesn't mean he has a poor behavior. So, it is better to avoid judging by anyone's look.

Real people don't worry or even care about how good they look. They only care about how good their heart is by expressing themselves to others with caring and lovely behaviour. The way people think and see others means a lot in real world. So, think good and see the best out of the people they meet.
