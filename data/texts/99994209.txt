                        I am more likely to be happy if they focus on my own goal. because I believe that happiness comes by pursuing my own dreams and my own personal goals only. When I start pursuing my own thoughts I feel my soul happy. At the any state of my life I just fulfill myself and the soul which is inside me. I put my whole values and strength to purse it. Either they are from my family or out of my family. When I feel happy it all starts from myself based on my mind set I pursue my own thought or work for people around me.
                       At some of the time I made myself happy by made others happy. Either they are from my family or out of my family. When I feel happy it all starts from myself based on my mind set I pursue my own thought or work for people around me. Maximum of time I felt happy among my kids and run through my kids back. And I will always come forth for my kids future schedule because it was more important in my life as a mather, and I achieve it at any cause of my life.
                        I have some spiritual thought and behaviour in my daily life. When I feel down it is the only way I lift myself up down overcome my problems.
