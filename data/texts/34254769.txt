                       I believe cooperation achieves more success as a whole over competition. Although competition can be a motivating tool a person can use to achieve success. I feel that both cooperation and competition can be used simultaneously to achieve an outcome but ultimately through cooperation, success is more rewarding.
                        A perfect example of cooperation being used successfully was the recent global Covid-19 pandemic. Scientists from all over the world came together to produce a vaccine.  Countries large and small devoted scientists, doctors and health officials to share data and findings openly with each other. This cooperation single handidly produced a vaccine as well as treatment in a record breaking amount of time. Not only did this unite the scientific community, but the entire world. The achieved success of the vaccine and current treatments brought together faith in mankind.  If there was no sharing of scientific data or selfish behavior exhibited by scientists from  certain countries, the whole process of identifying and isolating the virus, then experimenting and testing for antibodies, and finally developing and performing human trials would have taken years instead of months to produce a vaccine or treatments. Even though some would say that competition to be the first country to develop a cure was a driving factor, without the cooperation of the whole world, none of this would have been possible in the remarkable time frame which it was achieved. 
                        In conclusion, I believe that competition is a healthy way for some to motivate and be driven to succeed but ultimately cooperation is an utmost necessity in achieving positive, long term success.
