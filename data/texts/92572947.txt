Images in the media honestly have to much effect on what people say, think and feel. Within the last 3 years, it has been complete madness! Images are targeted to specific parties and different types of ethinic groups. People pick a leader and if that leader can portray himself as a god like figure people will follow. It honestly depends on the indiviual himself. For instance, Donald Trump portrayed himself to make America great again and to keep out immigrants.

The problem with the term with that is, America isnt just The United States! There is Latin America and Central America and the same people he doesnt want here.. they themselves are American as well. The fact that people think that America is just the states is ignorant. The fact that a public figure can state that we ourselves are just American is ignorant. I was on Tiktok and Latin America was debating with indiviuals from the states and the people from the states were saying "You guys wish you were American" How ignorant is that

No shade towards Donald Trump or ANYONE who supports him but his influence on what an American is is sad. If you ask me, we are all American and we are what makes the Three Americas great. The influences that politicians and entertainers have can really influence regular people every day. Thats why we have to watch what we say and how we say it. There are kids watching. What we do in todays world could really hinder the next world, or worse, the upcoming generation. Images and impressions can really affect the way the world runs.
