Everyone reacts to the world around them differently, which is why I think it would vary from person-to-person whether or not somoene would achieve more success by cooperation or by competition. However, I think more than likely people achieve more success by cooperation. 

Cooperation is more important that competition because it relies much less on getting very focuses on those around us, and is more centered on the task at hand. For example, someone might be more worried about what their coworker is doing and how to perfectly match their actions, rather than trying to do their own work. This would lead them to, yes, competing, but not necessarily to success.

I cannot fully say that competition would not drive someone to success because some people need that factor of "defeating others" to feel motivated. However, speaking personally, I do not need that motivation. In a world without competition, I think there would be more positive and happy work environments where coworkers support each other, rather than try to tear each other down. 

In conclusion, I believe that competition does play a role in the road to success, but it likely shouldn't be in the front seat. Thanks to cooperation and actual dedication to the task, I think someone is much more likely to be successful.
