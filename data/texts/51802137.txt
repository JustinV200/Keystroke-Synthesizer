As a millenial, I grew up with the idea that success was a big house with lots of fancy cars and money. However, as time has gone on and the ways of the world have proven that success can come from a variety of sources. I have found that materialism is one of the largest faults of modern society and should not be seen as a life goal. 

As we grow up, we are taught that people without a "real education" or a college degree aren't going to make it anywhere in life. We are taught that money is freedom and the key to happiness. However what we do not realize, is that our lives become dependant on live to work instead of work to live, and that we are now striving for an unttainable idea of living that very few will eventually grasp. When we own too much, we become stuck in our lives, or we try to make do, we try to buy more space, more time, for more things, tying us down more and more. 

In turn, I think it's important to simply as much as possible. To rid yourself of excess items, to reduce emissions and to live in smaller homes. The less you have to hold on to, the more you can travel and adventure. I feel that travel and adventure and experience are the true meaning of happiness and leading a fullfilling life. Because, if you're spending all of your time trying to buy things, where's the time to go and do fun and exciting new things? 

Overall, I think it is up to each individual to choose how materialism affects their life. To some success is a big house, to others its a road trip across america. All I know is that the less you have to think about and own, the more you're opening yourself up to other oppurtunity.
