Happiness.  What is it? How can you achieve happiness? Is happiness about yourself or others? Those are questions a lot of people ask themselves. Can you be happy by just pursuing your dreams and your own personal goals? Or can you only be happy if you focus on others instead of yourself? It is a very good question. And personally, I do not believe that everyone has the same opinion on this. I believe that you should focus on yourself, not others.

I have struggled in my life so far with depression and anxiety. I've dealt with a lot of bad things in my life. I've never beem happy with myself or who I am as a person. I have gotten to the point where I was so unhappy with myself that I contemplated suicide. And I've always been the type that LIKES to help others. But I wasn't happy myself, I wasn't happy with myself, and that was very detrimental to my mental health. For that reason, I think happiness first comes from yourself. You need to achieve your personal goals and become happy with yourself before you can ever help make anyone else happy. 

Now, I know a lot of people will say things like "You are selfish if you only think of yourself," and will bring up religion. You need to help other people. You'll be a better person if you think of others and help others before yourself. And I fully understand that. I understand people feeling that way. I understand people having their own opinions on happiness and who should be focused on first. But you can't even start focusing on other people and trying to make other people happy if you are not happy yourself. You need to learn to be happy. You need to persue your dreams. Figure out what you want to do in life. Explore and try new things. figure out what goals you have in life. What you want to do. Only then, I think, is when you should help other people and focus on the improvement of humanity. You cany help others until you learn to help yourself first.
