When was the last time you gave a homeless person money? Many people turn a blind eye toward the less fortunate people around them. In modern society we often attribute success with the amount of money and possessions people own. We try to portray ourselves as selfless, but we often hide our inner behavior. Materialism is given a bad connotation because it is associated with greed. We want to have a good public image. However, I argue that without materialism there would be no modern society.

The world is built upon ambition largely influenced by materialism. We want to have more possessions and money, so we have to work harder to build our capital. This drives progress and innovation. Materialism also brings about a sense of monetary and financial security. Do you want to be the person begging for money or do you want to be the giver? Without a doubt most people would choose the latter. 

Finally, materialism drives productivity and happiness. In order to get your dream car or house you would have to spend a lot of time and effort into achieving those goals. When you have goals in life you will work tirelessly to meet those objectives. You reap what you sow and happiness comes with the adventure. In conclusion, we should be embracing materialism but not greed. There is a big difference: if you are in the position to give to the less fortunate, you should do so with an open heart, and you should not neglect or berate them for their life circumstances. People should not be criticized for being materialistic, instead they should be judged by their character and actions.
