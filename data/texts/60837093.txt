 When I think of this dilema the old saying comes to mind "you catch more bees with honey than the stuff you are throwing around." (author unknown)  With that in mind, there are times when competition is best. For example; sports, spelling bees and team games. These areas are known for their competitive nature and requirements of competition are often driven into the minds of each player.  This is usually done with small groups eventually acheiving larger group tournaments. 
  However, when we think of the day to day activites of home life it is best to work in a coorperative fashion. There simply is no need to compete with loved ones when given an assigned task. For example daily household chores. Why would a person hold a competition on who can do the dishes the fastest? This simply is a disaster waiting to happen. Exception to this rule, you are teaching young children to not waste time doing a simple task when there has been clear evidence of wasting time on such task in the past. Such as taking out the trash. 
  Moreover, when we think about employment, again cooperation is best. When given a specific task you simply do the task. If you need assistance you ask for it. That is the value of cooperation. Being a team player. 
It is my belief that cooperation will give lasting results.
