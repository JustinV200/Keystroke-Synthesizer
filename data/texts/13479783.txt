Images and impressions in the things that we see, read & hear in our daily lives have an astounding effect on people. Oftentimes this effect is actually more negative and misleading than it is portrayed to us. This is done by design by the creators of how this information is delivered to us whether it is by advertisements, packaging or in the media.

Oftentimes, images have the effect of making products or things seem to be much better than they are. An example of this is for the supplement products that show the advertisement of someone who is overweight and they start taking supplements and they are miraculously losing weight in a very short period of time. They show the before and after photos of someone and then they tell people that the only thing different that this person did was to take those supplements! The weight just fell right off in no time! This is usually not the case. Perhaps it works that way for some people, but not for the average person.

Another example is when you go to buy cookies in the store. They are in this beautiful packaging and they have a large picture of the cookie on the package. It leaves you with the impression that this is the actual size of the cookie that is inside. Usually this it not the case. The photo may be 2 or even 3 times larger than the actual cookie. If it is larger, sometimes, in very small print they may say that on the packaging, though it doesn't always, and it is oftentimes very hard to see.

We see well known public figures promoting items which makes us think that they actually use those items. In reality, they may have never tried the item before in their life!

All in all, people are being duped into thinking that things are much better than they really are because of the way they are being portrayed to us. As consumers, we need to start opening our eyes, thinking with our logical heads, and understanding that if things seem to be too good to be true, it probably is!
