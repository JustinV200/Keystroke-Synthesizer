Success is such a strange concept that can mean much different things relative to both indviduals and cultures. In a competition driven society, such as exists in the United States, you will hear phrases such as "self-made man" or to "pull yourself up by your bootstraps". Both of these statements promote individual competition and minimize the contributions of the systems around the individual. Without the cooperation systems that exist within society there is no indvidual success. It is my position that people achieve more long lasting and meanigful success with cooperation.

In the United States, no individual is truly out to sea alone, so to speak. The systems in place may be broken but provide transportation, healthcare, education, and various other services which support and maintain both the individual and society as a whole. Beyond this any "self-made man" that has a family of his own has the cooperation of his partner to assist in the success that he has achieved. The support of personal and governmental systems is the most basic form of cooperation that exsits within this society. 

When the tasks and needs of the many are addressed for the benefit of all, instead of for the betterment of a few more indviduals become impowered to contribute to society and continue to further the success of all. In a cooperative system all indviduals are seen as having worth, value, and are given space to exist and thrive. By comparision, a competitive system will naturally exclude and minimize the contributions of people which ultimately limits progress and success because fewer people are working towards/believe in the end goal. In summary, individual and society will both achieve more success through cooperation.
