Yes, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people.  This is an issue as old as time.  Humans have always made images to impress their thoughts on those they wish to influence.

The ability to effect people is what drives advertising, media events and entertainment.  Entertainment is in the eye of the beholder.  What may influence you may not influence someone else.  The gulliability of someone can be seen in today's influx of 'influencers'.  The shallowness of those who believe everything on the internet is true and factual.  This results in people not educating themselves but relying on others to tell them what to think and feel.

Images and impressions can be used for the benefit of those in need.  The images of children suffering in poverty and hunger will bring about donations.   These donations may be helpful or they may only go towards increasing the weatlh of someone who preys on the gullible.  

The most impressionable are teenagers and college students.  This is why it is so important for parents to be imvolved in the child's education, no matter the age.  Educators and adminstrators have so much impact on what your child sees and hears.  College age students have shown an alarming appitude for being shallow and believing they are extremely knowledgeable on every subject.  When in reality, they are not.

Using images and impressions will continue to be tools to influence those who think if I buy this product, I will look like that.  They will not. It is a situation where if a person looks carefully, does not take every filtered image at face value, make imformed decisions, the world would be a better place.
