Happiness, we all seem to be in search of it, at some point or another in our lives. I believe that people are more likely to be happy when focusing on their own personal goals rather than the  happinesss of others. Through my own personal experience, as well as the observation of other peoples experiences, I have drawn the conclusion that time and energy is better off spent investing into ones self. Happiness comes from within, It's a combination of understanding, appreciation, and growth that leads to happiness. People are far more likely to grow and find happiness when focusing on their physical health/mental health, religion/spirituality, education, job, whatever goal they might have for themselves. Also people have more control over there lives, when focusing on said goals. When focusing on the happiness of others, we sometimes tend to neglect ourselves and our own needs. It can be draining at times ensuring everybody else is okay. People also tend to go overboard and misuse, or evn take advantage of kindness. Although happiness can come from others, such as the feeling inside that we all have for showing a loved one appreciation, or being the reason for someone smiling. Its important to remember that we should not rely on others to make us feel happy. Sometimes we can become too reliant, on said person. Sometimes we are alone, and can't rely on others. In conclusion focusing on personal goals is more likely to leave people happy than leaving it up to others, because we all have our own life paths, and happiness is found through, understanding, growth, and appreciation for said life path.
