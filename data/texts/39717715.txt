      our happiness is within us , it will not available from others...it is a quotes which i was recently readed from social media.
       the quotes was correct, we are the king in our own life, thus our own happiness is our own goals. how other happiness is fulfil our mind? when our own goal becomes true, that can fill our mind with happiness. other's successed  goal cannot fill our mind with happiness.  
         now a days all are running for their own needs, nobody wait for others . so why we try to fulfil other goals, if we help to success other goals, they give all credits to us?..never ,they only encourage their own.. 
         for example in the running race, the two participants were involve in the competition, one is me and the other(best friend), the two have the target. if we success ,it gives me to more happiness, the contrast, if me help to the other success(best friend), it gives me as satisfaction not happiness. at that time the opponent  has the more happiness, that time my mind full of guilty and the face only shows the happiness, how that is accept as happiness? it is not happiness, it is fake form of happiness to beleive the society , me as a good person. that can not definitly gives me a happiness.
         so the personal goal only can gives us happiness,  the focusing of other goals gives the satisfaction and it is a 'mask of happiness'. if we focus to our goal, it gives happiness in  starting to ending  which means when the goal's first step to final step.
