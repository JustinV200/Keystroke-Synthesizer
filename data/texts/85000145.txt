I believe that being materialistic should be critized in today's modern society. People should not be judge on the materials they own or can buy, but for the positive actions and kindness they show others. To be a good person is a much more desirable trait than being able to buy anything or have everything they want. 

Some people believe that they shouldn't be judged for the items they buy, the things they own, and what they choose to spend their money on, and maybe they shouldn't, but don't you think that the world would be a much better place if those that could would help those that cannot help themselves. I'm not saying that the people who can afford all the lavish items shouldn't get what they want, but if they could help those less fortunate with a few needs the world would be a much better place. 

For example, if someone is willing to spend $250,000 on a luxuary vehicle just because they can, I believe they should buy a modest, reliable vehicle and maybe help someone pay for their groceries for a week. Yes, they may not have their luxary car, but they probably just change the life of that person or family for whom they bought the groceries. Possibly they could put money aside in a scholarship fund to send someone less fortunate to go to college. That young person may end up going to college and because the person to cure an "incurable" disease. If more people were recognized for their kindness, maybe more people would follow suit.

I hope people realize that having everything you want would be nice, but helping others is much grander. Those items that show status or help people stand out among others may be great, but they cannot be taken beyond this world. Good deeds and sharing kindness blesses the soul, and that is so much more than what money can buy.
