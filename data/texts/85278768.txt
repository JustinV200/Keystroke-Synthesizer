In today's world in our everyday lives it has become harder and harder to judge things and people as the appearances they maintain for people or the ads advertisers use to promote a product is more likely to be used to obfuscate somethings true state of being whether its through flashy packaging and Ads with minimal relevant information or celebritys and politicians plastering on fake smile's to mask their true thoughts it has become more difficult than ever to seperate how something appears and how it really is.

It is my belief that society has grown too dependent on relying on appearances of people and other things without ever putting forth the token effort to look deeper and see if the book matches the cover so to speak, whether its a politcian promoting something and then immedietly disregarding it when they get what they want or a company advertising and promoting a product that fails to live up the whatever hype they set out for it or is activly harmful.

We can look around us and see examples of this happening every day, like for instance, Apple presents itself as a high tech and innovative company but in reality they sell overpriced products compared to competitors and employ questionable business practices like trying to remove peoples ability to repair their own phones or removing key features in order to sell proprietary equivalents but looking at them at face value you would never be able to tell from the appearances they maintain.

The counterpoint to this can be argued in regards to the appearance of advertisements is that their is a unspoken understanding that advertisers or people will try to hype up something beyond what is reasonable or a celebrity or politician promising something but not being able to deliver that could be argued to be just bad luck or good intentions gone wrong, this is understandable but at the end of the day it is how something appears that matters rather than how it really is.

In conclusion people today put too much stock in the appearance of any one thing or individiual and often let that either fool them or lead them astray until what a given person thinks does not match the reality around them.
