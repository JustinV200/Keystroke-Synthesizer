Impressions and images do have alot of impact on people today.  The better looking a person or certain thing is, the more it is desired. People tent to overlook the actual content of a certain thing and even the inner deeper peson just because we judge by the looks and not what that perticular thing really has.

Marriges nowadays dont really last. Some people tend to ask why, my opinion is, we should observe and stop asking and stop asking. We tend choose by how hot a girl looks and how beautiful they are outwards and we forget the inner beauty of a person. We get married in a rush and later get to find out the ugly part of it all. At the end of the day, beauty fades and we are left with the person and how they truely are. Hence our today marriages ending in divorce so quick.

Today we are told when going to an interview, we should be presentable. Wear a suit and a tie.  The generation of today, a suit and a tie seem so old fashion. Although some people do adhere to such, more dont. In an nterview, one will come with a suit and another with some jeans. Then again, this is where we start judging; appearance. The man with the suit will certanaintly get the job and overlook what the man in the simple jeans has to offer, whether he is better or not. 

We should not be persuaded by the outer part of attractiveness of a person or a thing. We should first get to know the content and what it offers before judging and giving the final impression. A thing might be ugly and not presentable on the outside but one might be. shocked by the content of a simple thing and also the inner beauty of a person. We should give chance but not based on appearance otherwise we will miss alot better things and better people if we do.
