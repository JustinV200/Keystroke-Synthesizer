Unfortunately, in this day in age of social media, from individual people to large corporations and even government entities, impressions can overtake reality. What is real and what is the truth can be manipulated by those who control the message. It's no longer about being truthful, but how to convince people of something that they wish to portray.

People do this by posting images of themselves that they wish others would want to believe is real. Even looking perfect can be manipulated with sophisticated photoshopping techniques. Painting a picture of a lifestyle can be conjured up with a few well placed photos in places that have nothing to do with reality. Corporations virtue signaling that they believe in causes by posting ads or slogans that they think will appeal to the masses when in actuality they don't give a hoot about the cause. Big business is all about big business. They will contribute large sums of money to the cause of the month to convince consumers that they put their money where their mouth is. Don't confuse this with their main mission which is to their shareholders and to the corporate bottom line. Celebrities who get up on soapbox and give their opinion on matters that are in no way shape or form within their field of expertise. It's all about creating an image.

So, to help combat these slick attempts to coerce people's minds, we all have to do our due diligence because the main stream media certainly won't. They are part of the problem. Don't believe everything you hear or see. Be curious. Investigate for yourself what the truth is. Fight the urge to go along with the crowd on any subject. Be an independent thinker. Determine for yourself what the truth is. Also, do believe that most people are rational and have common sense. Don't take for granted what you see on social media or main stream media. You be the judge. Don't let others make judgements for you.
