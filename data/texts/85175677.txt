Happines comes to those that achieve their goals. The sense of success is different then anything else. The only person that can bring true happines to themselves, is themselves. People come and go, so it's best not to get too attached to others. The future will hold many different things, but the only happiness that will always stay true are those of your accomplished goals. Here are a few examples of what this means.
When someone is hoping to reach their goals, there is something exciting about trying to make them real. Being able to chase after something and succeed is an amazing feeling and a type of happiness not everyone can achieve. Anyone can find happiness in others, but being able to focus and achieve your own goals is something unique. People can also leave you in life, so if you depend on the happiness of others, you might be left all alone in the end, with nothing to really call your own. People are fickle things, and they aren't known for being loyal to someone. The only thing that is loyal and will follow you for sure into the future will be goals and accomplishments that you have done. These are things that you can mention or have in awards that can be kept at home. This is how focusing on your personal goals are more important then focusing on the happiness of others.
In the end, the only person that should matter to you, is yourself. You should always put yourself first and let others come later. Your own goals and dreams are the most important things, and the things that will give you true happiness. Not accomplishing your own goals might haunt you for the rest of your life and this might cause you to never feel truly happy about your life. Is that what you really want for yourself? Being haunted by your unaccomplished dreams and goals?
