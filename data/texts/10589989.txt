Appearance is the most important thing in all area, For all around us appearance are mistaken for reality example if a person from a higher Management status They could more concentrade on their appearance, because everyone judge them based on their appearance first after the conversation they could judge based on their knowledge.
In real life clever advertisements create a favourable impressions but say little or nothing about the products they promote, they only try to create best first impression through actors or visualization. In stores colorful packages are often better than their contents even if they had bad contents also get greater sales rate only because of their outter package.
Like in Media how certain entertainers, politicians and other public figures appear is more important than their abilities, because people can buy their products only because of the popular actor or sports person. After the experience the product quality they reliased that it would made a mistake also.
More over branding and digital marketing are play the major role in that. They could not advertise the product by their quality. They only concentrate on their outter appearance and how they create a new idea to establish themself over the people. So quality of the product pay the second role in that. Because if tehy only work on outter coverage means they could not stable at their position in  the market.
