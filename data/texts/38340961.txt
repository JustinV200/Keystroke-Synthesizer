The question is should society, or just a person be criticized for be materialistic? It seems that we are compelled to acquire as much material wealth, as we can. It seems that that is what we do. There is evidence of it everywhere.
I do believe that we are a bit out of control with acquiring possessions, but that is how we are wired. There are many reasons a person acquires material possessions. Some just want to show off and have bragging rights. Other people are looking for security in their life, so additional possessions will provide that. Like anything else we do, we are all different and do things for different reasons. If no one is harmed, then it is OK.
To have a better idea of the amount of material possessions we are acquiring, you only need to look at storage facilities. We have so much stuff that it won't fit in our house, garage, basement, attic, or even the shed. We need to rent more space for our stuff. Then you have a house in the neighborhood that is just overflowing with stuff, because the people that live there are hoarders. A few houses away, we have a minimalist. They feel that less is more. No clutter and less stuff to worry about.
Some would think that acquiring so many possessions is a waste of our resources. Others would say, it's good for the economy and provides jobs, and storage units.
Bottom line is this. Don't worry about what your neighbor has or doesn't have, just mind your own affairs.
I feel like I have more stuff than I need and it's OK to be critical of myself, but not OK to critizise somone else for their possessions.
