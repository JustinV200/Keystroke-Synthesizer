What is happiness? Have we ever asked it to ourselves? Happiness is a feeling that we find in our inner cell or in our heart. Whichever or whatever make us feeling good is happiness. It does not matter from where it comes from or who the person is? Happiness is love, it is our inner feeling which comes our mind and secrete the hormone called dopamine. That's called happiness.

In this very world here are some people who finds happiness everywhere but they could not find it because they can't find it in his or her inner soul. Some other types of people who believe that those person who are happy only because they achieve there goal in his or her own way. They think that only achieving a goal or earning a handsome salary or  money is important for happiness but the fools don't know that the actual happines is spreading the love among the people and helping others with foods, money or some other things are important to achive the actual hapiness. This gives you the ultimate inner happiness which gives you the ultimate pleauser. this is the actual happiness.

  In this scenario, I want to say that the actual happiness only finds to help other with your maximum potentsity. I find my happines to give foods and drinks to those who are needy.
This give me those happiness which feels me those satisfection which I can't describe in words.  Nowadays to help others is disappearing day by day. We should turn the table and helping other in my way at least one time. Then you will understand that after helping the needy and the poor their smile and their boon how much give you the inner pleauser. this is the actual necter not only in this celestial world but also the universe. Yes it is.
