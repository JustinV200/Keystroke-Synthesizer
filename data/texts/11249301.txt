What does it mean to be part of a team? Team players must follow the right procedures if they want to be productive. In order for each person to feel accomplished in their work, they need to feel a bond in some way with their peers. Because without that bond, each person's efforts would be misaligned, and without these synchronized working decisions, there wouldn't be a common method to approach their work. That would ultimately lead to failure for the group. Equal cooperation is key in today's society because it creates teamwork and opportunity for individual growth, whereas fierce competition creates turmoil and heirarchy in the workplace.
People have different abilities that add value to the team so no one is left out. When a person feels inadequate at their job, it's up to that person to handle the pressure and take care of the problem facing them to their best ability. If that person felt that their co-workers/teammates wanted them to fail, then they wouldn't be able to handle their feeling of inadequacy and end up doing poorly. On the other hand, if that person felt like they had to do their best for the success of everyone around them, then they would proudly solve the issue. Cooperation is important for the team to achieve victories because it gives people a reason to do their best.
People have often felt that working with other people can be risky since you don't know if other people can be relied on. It's not easy to trust other people to be as qualified as yourself. However, working together with people of different skills is just the way it is. Even if you're a veteran, you can't express to others that you feel like you're way above them because in time everyone will eventually get to the place that fits them. Rather, individuals should be helping the group by giving healthy and supportive motivation. As a result, everyone will work for growth in their unique way.
