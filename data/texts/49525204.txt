I think images and impressions absolutely have too much of an effect on people. This is simply due to the way that society has progressed and how the human mentality has changed over time. There are probably outside factors that have played a role in this as well but at the end of the day, impressions and images are very important. 

One of the biggest reasons why social media has blown up is due to the impressions and social status that people can gain from it. For example, we see so many social media influencers promoting different products, some that they don't even use, just for advertising and monetary purposes. So many people buy into these influencers and the products that they use, and put them on a pedestal. They compare themselves to these people because they think that they have perfect lives. 

However, what you see online, in advertisements and on social media is not all that is there. Many people promote a specific lifestyle and fake their way through life in order to have a higher social status. Many people are actually unhappy but you would never know it if you just looked at the way that they come across. This is specifically because of how society has continued to change over time. We all want to be popular, fashionable, and in the "in" crowd. It makes people feel better about themselves and much more important. However, in reality the most important thing that you can do in life is just be yourself. 

There are many people who rely way too heavily on the things that they see rather than the reality of life and the situations that they're actually in. Social media, entertainment and advertisements have played a major role in this shift. We see so many people who seem to have perfect lives, and many people get jealous and want that life for themselves. However, it's essential to remember what you see on the surface is not reality. What you see on the outside is the reality that people want, not the reality that is actual reality.
