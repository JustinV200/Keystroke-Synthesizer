  In this essay, we will look at the topic of if people are more successful using cooperation or competition. The world we live in is very complex, and we are usually called upon to work with others at some point in our journey towards success, so it is useful to know which way would be most helpful.
  I personally think it is more usefull to use cooperation in working towards success. Working with people is part of life, and knowing how to achive this well, at any point in our pursuit of our goals, will help to produce stronger, more lasting accomplishments in the future.
  If there is rivalry at work, or even in play in life, it can of course produce a strong work ethic, and push people to avoid failing,  and even help a person succeed in gaining victory. However, while competition using skills and ideas drives people, this can also lead to more problems interacting and understanding others viewpoints and strengths. Ultimately, we will more than likely need others in our success journey, so working so hard to be on top alone will be less helpful than cooperation with the others we'll need to help us achive our dreams and goals.
In conclusion, in my opinion, it's better for the end goal, to use cooperation over competition towards a result of being successful.
