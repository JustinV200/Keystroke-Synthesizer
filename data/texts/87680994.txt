                                                            Apprearnce Vs Reality 

          The first apperance makes the big impact on all the stream. It will create the overall idea about the content. People works hard on the content on prepares the appreance or cover to promote what they have when Quality is priority. 

 But nowadays things getting reverse by people start to work on apperance rathar than the content or object. 

 The professional ethics is the key factors for all kind of work or process. The ethics degrading in the modern era since people are busy with running behind the money instead of satisfaction and peace in what they are doing. 

    For example in politics, well groomed or qualified person/party always concentrate in their policy and idealogy and keep work on it. But now a days person/party gives prioirty to advertisment and politics calculation to crack the situation. And also gives importants on making impact and gaining attention by sensational news or information. Finally people beleives what they have seen instead of feel or understand.
 In tersma of product also the same kind issues exist. Based on the appearance people buying lot of things right from grocery to products. But ended-up with dissatisfaction or frustration since what they have seen and the reality is totally different. 

  I personally beleiev the Media (including social, tele, print) plays vital role on gaining people attention. They brought people into differnt mind set of look over of product or process or a person. The owner of the content/source should take the responsiblity on this.  In some cases media keep on manipulate the things which is different than the reality. It is everone responsiblity to provide good serive/product to the customer and the same time people should think of their own instead of simply influnce by others.

 I wish things will get back the normal where apperance and relaity matches at some point.
