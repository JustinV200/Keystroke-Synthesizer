Do people achieve more succes by coperation or by competition?

In the world, theres two kind of people, the one's that promove the competition and believe's that the succes it's a one-person thing, and the one's that believe's that the succes it's a team work, but wich one of this ways it's the best to achieve the succes?;

Well, that depends, in this world, with so many people, the oportunities, and the way to do the things does'nt work in the same way for all of us, everyone need's to finde the way in the one they feel comfortable, because that's the real way to the things, being yourself, in the way that you wants, but talking about the way that have a higher percentage of succes, it's the cooperation, because being more it implies more of all, ideas, points of view about all the problems, more solutions to that problems, and the backup of all the members of your team.

But in conclusion, all of us need's to find the way in the onde we feel comfortable, because it's useless if we made a team but all of us want to work allone because it's better for us, work in the way that you want to achieve your succes. 

thanks.
