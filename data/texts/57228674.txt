The human mind is often tricked by what we see and influenced by what people that we think are important or knowledgeable. The history of modern advertising shows as such, by convining an entire generation of women that hair on your body is a terrible thing and must be removed. 
  Images and impressions have a too large effect on people as most people believe what they see. If the can see it, it must be real and therefor must be correct. People are impressionable beings that with subtle nudging can be coerced in to beliving ridiculous things about the way things should be. 
  Razors are a good example of early 20th century advertsing that made people believe that body hair was unatural. The companys created entire campaigns of magazine ads denouncing body hair and shaming women that had hairy legs. To this day, 100 hundred years later hair removal is expected in the US and there is a stigma passed down through generations of women of having hairy legs. Diamonds are another example where people saw images and thought that must be a real thing. The Debeers family, also in the earlly 20th century, had a lot of diamonds and low sales. They created the idea of the engagement ring and that it should be a large expense to boost their bottom line. All of a sudden you must get this ring and it becomes an integral part of the wedding and marriage experience. These two items are now part of the cultural landscape of modern existance due to people being imfluened by images and impressions. 
 People have always been impressionable and gullible to what the important person is saying. They follow the most convining leader and fall for the most compelling advertisiing, even at a detrement to their lives. Images and impresssions do have too large an effect on people as they are mostly unaware of the impact they have on the human mind and effect they have on their own personal reality.
