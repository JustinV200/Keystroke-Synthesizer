Competition and cooperation seem to have been around since the beginning of organic life on this planet. Animals competeting with each other for food, while cooperating with their familes to be more successfull at surviving. Even at the molecular level there is always some sort of competition and competiting going on.

Both competition and cooperation appear to be equally essential in life. Although I would argue cooperation seems to have better results. The egyptians from what we know used cooperation physically and mentally to build many things like the pyramids. The competition to this was they enlisted slaves. The upperclass vs the the outcasts of the time.

Some say competition is vital in things like a capitalist market. I disagree and see it failing just as much as a "socialist" or non competitve market would. While socialism fails in huge populations and with greedy individuals, capitalism fails in much the same, mainly by greedy corporations.  

Cooperation also seems to be the answer to competition. What happens when a greedy individual is taking everything? People get together and cooperate to put a stop to this. It is in my estimation working together promotes a less stressful & healthier environment than being at odds with one another.
