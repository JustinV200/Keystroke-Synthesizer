Happiness is a very funny thing. It can be here one day, and gone the next. As a human race we constantly struggle as we look for those things in life that make happiness a consistent feeling within us. There is always this debate of does taking care of ourselves or helping othesr make us happier. Truth is it is never truly easy to tell.
For me, I am a firm believer happiness is derived from helping others. Have you ever seen the look on your kids face, your parents face, your friends face, when you do something small for them that makes them so happy? There is nothing like it in life. Helping your loved ones smile is a feeling unlike any other, and one that should be absolutely cherished in life.
Many people will argue that you need to focus on yourself and your own happiness, and while they are not totally wrong. When you focus too much on yourself it can be a selfish aspect, and ultimately that can lead to unhappiness. If you don't have those people to celebrate your big accomplishments with, then what do you really have at the end of the day? You can achieve many great things in this life. You can get the big time job, hit your fitness goals. But if you do it in a selfish way, you won't be feeling all that happy when you don't have the others around you to celebrate with.
To me life is truly about how we make others feel. It doesn't have to come from purchasing things, but it can be remembering small about someone. It can be a simple "Hey, how is your day going today?" that can really turn a person's day around, and ulitmately channels your inner happiness. To me it really is no debate, when you focus on the happiness of those around you, you find that happiness all yourself. I am a big believe if you give back and do things the right way, good things will be sent back to you. Live your life to the fullest and look out for your own happiness, but help others out as well. it is what the human race is all about!
