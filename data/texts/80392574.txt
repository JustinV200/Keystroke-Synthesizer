In this day and age, I believe images and impressions have too much influence over people, and this influence is causing people to stop thinking for themselves.

This is an unfortunate side-effect from the power main-stream and social media gives to anyone. You don't need to be an expert to influence the public.  You just need to look good and appeal to the public. Those most affected by this kind of shallow appeal are the youngest consumers.  These younger generations are being raised to believe appearances count for more than education, integrity, and hard work.

If you look at the the Kardashian family, for example, you can see individuals who have altered their looks with money they did not need to earn themselves.   These individuals have created a look for themselves that others find attractive and this has given them a public stage to express opinions and influence people.  They are not experts in any field, yet they have alot of influence over everything from what makeup woman buy, to who has been unfairly prosecuted by the US court system.  

You could say that because their family has been influential in the past, they deserve to have a stage, but these women haven't done anything to earn this kind of influence.  They are simply riding their family's coat-tails and money.

I believe we need to being highlighting and bringing into the main-stream media and social media people who have worked for where they are in life. We need to focus on those who are educated and show integrity, rather than those who simply look appealing. This would be a highly positive influence on our younger generations and would encourage them to work for what they have and to see through face-value and make their own decisions.
