Happiness is something that is different from other people. It is their personal goals that makes one happy,to fulfil something that they personally had a stake in. To see something from start to finish. People can be happy for others,but not entirely. True happiness isn't from seeing others, it is from someone who did something that they themselves made them happy without the influence of other people. People can not be happy with just other people that are happy. When they are happy for others there is a way to be envious of other people. It is hard to just be happy when other people are doing well around you and your life is still the same that it was before.

When it comes to happiness for others it is something that is immidiate and something that is short lasting. We can be happy for our friends for getting a new job but at the end of the day it is not something we accomplished but what they did. That is why focusing on our own goals brings better joy and filling to our person. It is because we had a doing in it. It is an achievement that we as people make for our goals and aspirations.We like to do something that matters because we are the ones that put our foot print on something. That we we focus on humanity and making it a better place it could also make people feel bad when something bad happens to humanity. 

When we finish a book or an art piece it is something that we remember. At the end of our day when we know what we did and how we did it, it stays longer, it builds our character and shows us we can do it. People have more feeling of purpose and excitement when they do something that they have been striving for. They can look in the mirror and at themselves and think that they are the reason something happened. And that is why it is more reason for them to be happy,because they are the ones that made themselves happy.When people are happy with themselves they can make others happy.
