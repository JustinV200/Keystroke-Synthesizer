Happiness can be found in lots of things. Some people can't find happiness no matter what the situation is. It all depends on the person. 

Knowing this accounts to what is enjoyable to the individual, whether it be something that someone helps them with or something as simple as just listening to what the person has to say. It varies depending on the situation. 

People can be happy when they want and it shows on their faces and aura. This can also make others happy for the time being. Having a personal goal and finally achieving it can be the ultimate hapiness for anyone that desires it. Others are just happy for no apparent reason, they are just thankful and content with the way they live their lives.

By focusing on one's personal goals, it can really allow someone to vent and strive to do their best in order to achieve that goal. Once accomplished, the person can chalk it up to their perseverance in order to complete their personal goal, therefore satisfying themselves on a job well done. 

Personal goals can be anything a person desires. They are then driven to accomplish that goal by any means necessary. That in itself is an exciting goal. The bottom line is that anyone can achieve their wants, once they have the goal they want to reach.
