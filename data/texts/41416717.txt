No it is the way we are accustomed to.  Being materialistic is not necessarily a bad thing.  It has its benefits.  People do benefit when they reap rewards from hard work.  The only time criticism should be apparent is if people are materalistic and are not financially able to care for themselves or their families and yet run into depth for wanting material objects.  This is the world we live in and it is just going to continue getting more and more materialistic.  Children learn early on that they want more and more and are not happy until they get these objects.  This continues into adulthood too.  We want new cars, new and bigger homes, new clothes, phones, etc.  It is a world consumed with objects and desires.  One must work hard and continue working hard if they want these possesions.  It is a sign of success when one can afford and has many luxury possessions.  One should not be punished but yet rewarded in society for making themselves successful and able to live off themselves instead of dependent on others.  People are always going to want more and more in life and if they can afford it then great.  I myself am happy when I can afford a luxury item for myself.  It means I achieved success and I am financially able to care for myself and able to afford the fine things life has to offer.  It makes me quite happy to be able to buy extra for myself and form my family.  I should be criticized if I could not afford it and put myself in depth doing so.  It is this type of world we live in.  The world is going to have more and more new objects that people will want.  It is the way we are brought up and it is what people want.  If you have the funds, it is your business and no one else's on how you spend your money.  If you work hard you should be rewarded.  Everyone has the right to happiness and if material things make you happy then you have a right to them.
