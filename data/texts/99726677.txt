  The world we live in today has us coming across countless promotions, ads, shows, videos and social media everyday. Advertisers and promoters are always trying to gain our attention and compete for sales, views, likes and subcribers. It seems like the real world and world of influencers are starting to become blurry. 

  These constant images of the "best" life, perfection and always having to be "on top" are not really a reflection of real life. Anyone can use filters, deep fake videos, auto-tune in music and photo-retouching programs to present themselves in the ideal light. I think this is having an ever greater negative effect on our young people. There is so much pressure on them to be flawless. 

  There have always been advertisements and shows published and shown to the public that try to influence their audience but it has never been as prominent as it is now. Young people are prone to depression and suicide more as a result. They try to model their life to be like what the see on the internet and it just is not reality. 

  There is nothing wrong with trying to sell products or promote celebrities and public figures in the best way as long as it is not misrepresenting who and what they truly are. People are now buying fake followers and fake commenters just to build up their social media sites. This adds to the problem of a blurred reality. Status is important to a certain degree but it not the ultimate reason for living.
