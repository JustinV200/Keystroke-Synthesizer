We as a group are constantly shrouded in advertisements. Whether it's through celebrities, influencers, or the various media propoganda, we are constantly bombarded with what we "should" have, even if we do not need it. Our first thoughts and memories are often tied to commercials, toys, or television shows, and humanity has been conditioned to believe the unbelievable from birth, living beyond financial and physical means. 
There are some people who think others should view these impressions for their face value; that the majority of people aknowledge these ads and their deception for what they are. But every time you turn on an electronic device, even if it's just a phone or a radio, the influence is there. Pop culture posts are swarmed with it. American citizens are barely able to afford a shelter in the current economic crises, but we are harassed to live beyond our means. I can not step out of my door without someone or something trying to sell an item or service to me. When you get caught up in the bustle of daily living, it can be hard to see that we do not need everything that everyone else has. And even if we can afford it, we are not truly buying what is paid for.
I can summarize the effect of altered reality using a favorite of American citizens- McDonalds. I see advertisements for McDonald's on a weekly basis- the beautiful photos of a carefully arranged, steaming burger for the almost impossibly low price. But once you finally get the burger in your hands, it is lukewarm at best and questionable in quality. Today's culture, along with the forms of media, has led us to believe that this is reality. Our "reality" is just a lukewarm patty, shrouded in the lies that feed us.
