In the age of digital and social media, I believe images and impressions have a great effect on people than any other time in our planet's history. On a daily basis, people are bombared with media, advertisements, and they see a fictional version of how the world really is and operates.

Today, on social media, influencers depict a highly edited version of the real world and the viewer is either too young, inexperienced, or perhaps too clueless to understand that fact. This can lead to envy and eventually depression on the viewer's part, because they want the life that they see on their screens. On the other hand, the lives of public figures also appear more important than they are; even if they take a dramatic turn. Take Johnny Deep's divorce trial for example; it's all over social media and I've even heard family members and co-workers discussing the case amoungst one another. That goes to show that public figures via social media are creeping into are daily lives more than we realize. Somehow, Johnny Depp's divorce has people talking as if they know him or as if they have some emotional investment to the matter. Personally, I'm constantly seeing images of the cases and for the life of me, I cannot understand people's obsession with it.

I think we would need to divorce ourselves from digital technology in order to break this connection. People will need to avoid television, the internet, and even roadside advertisements to free themselves from this bombardment of images and media. If this seems too extreme, than it probably is and that's because most people are not physically capable of removing themseleves from the bonds of digital and social media. In some cases that bond is emotional and people cannot envision their lives without this artificial connection.
