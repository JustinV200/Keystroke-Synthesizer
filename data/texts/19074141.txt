In the modernised and technologised world everyone like to earn money and possessions to live a satisfied and healthier life. Most of the people will feel like it is a extra burden and criticize it to a larger extent because they have to spent too much time and energy in this world for this materialisim.

But when we think about the future and its effect it brings, it is not a burden we should be materialistic to a certain extent where it should affect or hurt others life, When we think in that way it was appreciated and warm welcomed by everyone in this beautiful world. My friend is doing business at first he is not able to sustain in this business field but after many struggles he acquired knowledge about how to be materialistic and this has helped him to acheive great heights in life. Helearned a lot about life values after this incident. At first he hated this materialistic life because being materialistic has brought him many obstacles in his life.This success motivates him to help others and now he is running an orphange for free of cost to the mentally challenged people and he sees a change in their life by his possessions and money. Really it is a change to him and others. Now he is seeing happiness in many people and it is a real meaning of life.

Being materialsitic will not be criticized when it is used in the right place and it is always seen a change and brings you happiness. Eventhough it has faced many criticisim it is a good and great one. This modern life and culture is really a boon when we talk about this materialistic future. Finally it adds value to your time.
