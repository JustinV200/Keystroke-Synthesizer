Doing what you like makes you happy.  Happiness is what makes one smile whether it is witnessing someone's happiness or your own.

           Happiness would be accomplished if focusing on one's goals first before worrying about someone else's happiness.  One must feel happy about themselves first before they focus that attention on someone else.  The first and far most important peron is you when it comes to happiness.  Finish your goals so you can sit back and smile.
    
             If you are focused on someone' else's happiness and forgeting your own it may feel worthlesss and helplesness.  You want to be happy just as someone else would.  That focus can just make you forget about yours. Thinking about what you could have done better, etc.  I am not saying it is not right to be happy for someone else but just do not focus too much on that.

              Focusing and being too happy for others is not healthy.  If it going to encourage you to accomplish goals and be happy as well then it is benefiting you.  Learn and find out what or why they are so happy.  That could be your life as well.  Don't sell yourself short.
Love yourself.

             Life what a beautiful choice.  Life is too short to have sorrows, you may be here and gone tomorrow.  Live a little, laugh, make friends, enjoy yourself, hug your kids, travel, volunteer, help someone in need, exercise, go back to school.  Focus on you.
