Some believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals, and others believe people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others, but only one of these groups is correct. 

We cannot be in control of others. We can only be in control of ourselves. Happiness is incumbent upon expectations. A poor person might be happy with a roof over their head but a rich person might need much more to bring them joy. We cannot control the expectations of others and happiness is built upon to many different things to be able to make someone else happy, especially not all of the time. We can however reset our own expectations. One should look inside and inspect what they think they need to make themselves happy. There needs to be a level of intentionality in seeking happiness for most of us. 

One can often find examples of romantic relationships where one partner sacrificess their own happiness for that of their partner.  I would hate for the person I love to forgoe their own hapiness and to just focus on others. One should not wait or deprioritize their own happiness for others. People deserve to be able to seek out happiness and shouldn't rely on stumbling into it as they aim for some other than their own happiness.  Anyone standing in your path to happiness needs to get out of the way.

Trying to get your own happiness by seeking it out in others is a path to ruin. It is a waste of time. A fleeting effort. If you cannot be happy for yourself through yourself, how can one expect to make someone else truly happy? I would not want to be happy at the outright expense of someone else's happiness if I had my hoice. If we were all more focused on our happiness, maybe we wouldn't need others to help make us happy. Perhaps making ourselves happy is the path to making others happy.  

At the end of the day, people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals.
