Pursuing dreams are must thing that every one will have that once it is to get fulfilling their dreams is a kind of happyness. who said happyness is when fulfilling their goals and dreams? It is merely about the passion and the confiendent level one can held believing that is more strength. 

It meant for a small to huge things that we share or feelings or may be in any kind of way its is most matters. if we give a chocholate/held close to the childrens means they will be more happy that they believe thay are here for us ,here it stated that emotions plays a role. when you present something to your friend which he/she needed at the right moment that is untold feel that gives a more pleasure to them so here the soul connections described between them.

As a question focus of happyness and making happyness is some what irrational how can we say that a focus on thing that gives a happiness when u focus on the same line that you could not concentate on other things so change to adapt the improvement of a society, if a person cannot leand any money to the social and the family members , definetely he/she will be more happy person just beacuse they have a carrer goal only. People have mixed mind Taughts as they have more commitments in the living when they see a happiness in others they have a pure soul is a rare gem of hearts to be blessings like that.
