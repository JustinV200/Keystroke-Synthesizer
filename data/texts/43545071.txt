Images and impressions create lot of delusional expectations for the social media users who are full time on the influencing others by statying online all the time. In my opinion the vanity of the entity create too much of effect on the people because vanity is everything in this world even if we say that images are not important but the truth is images are everything in this pop culture world.

Impressions are the ones created by the so called influencers in the social media usages. It is in the form of posts and travel vlogs. Whether the impressions create good or bad effect, thats another debate to be made. We cannot generalize the outcome of the impressions but it is definitely making some effect on the general society of this impresionable world.

Colorful packages, well maintained toned body, well curated posts in the social media create a false reality for the people. It created a narcissictic feeling in the individul to be self important and self obliged. In my opinion it is all fascade of false reality of the worl we live in and to the audiences we craete a great enetrtainment. As a conclusion I would say that people do over hype of their ability. The so called collabarations on the social create false advertisement and even so it is conveying very little things.
