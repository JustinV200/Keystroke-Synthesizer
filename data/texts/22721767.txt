In modern society, life moves at a face past and advertisers are always trying to grab our attention. While independent thought remains an important personality trait, initial images and first impressions play a large role as well. Do they have too much of an effect on people? One could argue that it depends on the person being targeted by the image, but overall I believe that personal decision making overrides these effects. 

With so much of our life "online," first impressions have a strong hold on how we perceive a product or a figure. Celebrities often have a beautiful social media presence to present what they want us to see. Advertisements use catchy sayings and colorful images to grab our attention, and online retailers present their product in a way that tantilizes the buyer. Even in our own personal lives we curate our online image to present what we want people to see and believe about us. 

That said, most of us know it's all just a big fascade. Certain celebrities or media figures let us into the behind-the-scenes and not so glamourous action of their lives, and we can read through online reviews to see if the catchy image or beautiful product pictured is all it's cracked up to be. Critical thinking remains an important skill that most of us have and utilize to combat the images we are constantly barraged with. 

So, is there an effect from these images and impressesion? Yes, absolutely. But is it too much? I'd argue no. Individual thought remains an important character trait that most of us have and know how to use. This allows us to make decisions without too much influence from advertisers or social media. We know that what we see is not more important than reality, and live our lives based on this truth.
