Happiness comes in many forms for people, and it can certainly be different for everyone. Some people believe that happiness can come to someone when they are focused and driven by their own personal goals, while others think that happiness can only truly be found when you focus on helping others. I believe that although both can be true, if you want to find happiness by helping others, that is most likely a personal goal, so in turn, people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. 

True happiness doesnt always require you to discount your own personal feelings and I find that when you are happy, you in turn create a snowball affect that makes those around you more happy. Your personal goals may be about anything, it could be making more money for yourself, or advancing in your career, or helping others. If you succeed with these things, as they are goals you set out for yourself, you will in turn be satisfied and therefor happy. 

If you beleive that bettering mankind and sacrificing your happiness for those around you, who benefits from that? You will. Even if it's not instant, you would benefit from the betterment of mankind, which in turn would make you happy. Some may argue that it is possible to be happy by only caring for those around you, and by the betterment of mankind, but you have to understand that there is no truley selfless deeds. They said so on the TV show "Friends" so it must be true. But seriously, if you truely believe that happiness only comes from helping others, you are actually helping yourself. It has to make you happy to help others, so that mustve been a goal or dream you had. 

In conclusion, it is of course possible to happy in many different ways, but by putting your own goals first in order to acheive true happieness, you will surely be helping those around you to create happiness for them.
