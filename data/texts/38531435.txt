Is it wrong to be materialistic? Should the world be criticized for being materialistic? It's not wrong to have a lot of things unless it draws you away from a relationship with God.  While having lots of toys and things brings  short term happiness, God tells us to seek Him first and He will provide for us.  

Being materialistic is the way of the world.  Many people strive to impress others with material items to keep up with others and to make others think they have money.  The world wants you to buy now on credit and pay later.  The world's perspective says to make yourself happy first; me, me , me.  God's word, The Holy Bible, tells us to not chase after or store up things that will fade away and rot.   We can't take anything with us when we go so we should be focused on the one who saves our soul.

 It's not wrong to have a lot of things but how much time do you spend on or with that thing? How much time are you spending with God and serving others? We should be focusing on our relationship with God first and make Him Lord of our lives.  When we do this, our reward will be eternity in Heaven with Him. If we place our focus on God (Jesus Christ), then we wil be blessed as well as be able to use what we have been given to bless others.
