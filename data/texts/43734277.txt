Introduction:
                   I think there is a major problem for every young man and woman. This is going for a dream or going for their happinesss and comfort. I can say that both is important. Dream is important and we don't need to lose our happiness for that dream. Now we can see the problems and benefits of going for their goals.

Position: 
                   In my view both are important. But trying hard for the goal will give people happiness. Some people can't get ready for the normal life. This is only because of their mind. If they are ready they can enjoy the life.

Reasons and evidence: 
                  When we are ready to go for a goal it is not that much easy. We need to come out of our comfort zone. But if they achieved what they want, it will be enough to make their life happy. Some people can't come out of the comfort zone because of the various situations.

Counterarguments and rebuttals:
                   There is one prroblem that a person who going for a goal blaming a person who can't go for  a goal. This is unfair. Finally a life which make them happy and comfort is the important thing. If they are ready they can choose what they want.

Conclusion:
                   So I want to say that going for a goal is important. But losing their comfort life for the goal is not that much acceptable.
