Reality does not always meet expectations. It's important to know what is real and what is not real. That's why it's important while looking at things to consider what is real and what is not real.

Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Humans are visual creatures. So even though we may think something, we are really thinking about something because we see it. For example cooking and food. We may smell and hear exciting food being made, but we also eat with our eyes. The visual apperance of food plays an important role in how we perceive the food to taste. The food itself may be the most delicious thing you have ever tasted, but if it looks bad, then our first impressions are "oh, this is going to taste bad."

Another example is celebrities or actors. They exhibit a persona, a difference appearance on what they actually are in real life. For example, take Hugh Jackman. He plays Wolverine, a fictional character in X-Men. In the movies, Wolverine is a tough and mean character due to his past. However the person portraying Wolverine, Hugh Jackman, is actually very nice in real life. Hugh Jackman is simply playing a role, which happens to be the opposite qualities of what he is in real life.

So while images and impressions are embedded instinctually into our minds, it's also important to take a step back and ask, "is this thing I'm seeing actually representative of what is happening?"
