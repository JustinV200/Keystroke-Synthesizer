Is being materialistic a problem? It's a subject many people have views on, and not always in a good way. Materilism affects people from all walks of life. Why is it a bad thing to acquire posessions and spend money? It isn't. 

Some people like nice things. Some people enjoy the luxury of spending money. If it makes you feel good, why is it a problem? Again, it isn't.  It's a great feeling to see something you want and be able to buy it. Some people find pleasure in collecting expensive items, others find it in something as simple as spending money on little things. 

People may say that societry puts too much stock in material things. They may argue that money isn't everything and that it can't buy happiness. They may say money should be saved instead of spent, that items shouldn't be collected or that material things aren't the key to a good life. I disagree. I think some people have this viewpoint because of mislaid guilt. You can be empathetic to the plight of others without denying yourself the pleasure of buying things, even if they're frivilous.

In conclusion, we should do what makes us happy (within reason). If you have money to spend, spend it. If you enjoy nice cars, buy them. If that faberge egg catches our eye, put it on your mantel. Life is too short to hoard your dollars and wish you would've bought this or that. Life is also too short to worry about what other people are doing with their money.
