What exactly is happiness? Is it pleasing others or yourself? Why can't it be both? Can you not be happy while you also make others happy as well? I believe there are different levels and types of happiness.

Happiness can come from doing things for other people such as family and friends or even for total strangers. It can also come from doing things for yourself such as self care or even from doing little things like reading a book you have been wanting to read.

It has been proven that doing acts of kindness for others can help raise serotonin levels which help you to have happy feelings. Some people though need other forms to create a happy feeling such as thrill seeking and yet others are only happy if they do only for themselves. 

I would think it would be more rewarding to do good things for other people or even for the enviroment and that it would make a person happier if they did so more than if they only did for themselves especially if they were sincere. Though I guess some people would disagree and say that happiness comes from doing more for yourself is what would create more happiness. That could be correct in way unless it was for purely selfish reasons or if someone else gets hurt in the process.

 I believe happiness is purely up to the person seeking it and that it is for each individual to decide on their own what it is that would truly make them happy.
