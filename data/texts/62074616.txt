Personally i feel that happiness comes from our inner peace. No one makes us happy or destroy our happiness. We are responsible for happiness.We should take resposibility for our happiness. we should not depend on things or other peaople's. Once u start depening on other's then ur happiness totally out of control. On my opinion make your self happy. Do the things which your mind says.

Particulary focus on the personal goals and whatever keeps you happy. Do not let other people ruin your happiness. Keeping postive thoughts, positive atmosphere and make nearby people' positive will five you more happiness.

If you focus on your carrier goals or relationship everything should be in your control. If u see things falling apart immediately try to change ur mind from routine life and have a break. Search for the place where you can find inner peace. Especially sometimes we need to spend some time alone which gives you special power to identify which is real happiness. Spending time with nature like trekking, gardening , long drive will deifinitely gives you different perceptions about yourself and gives more power to concentrate on things which gives you strength and happiness.
 
Overall keep ur mind and circumstance peace is the best way to lead a happy life. If your happines depends on others there is point comes that others will leave you for an kind of reason. So be prepare for the situation and ready to face the consequences if you depend on others. Dont be mad at people just be mad on yourself. This is the only way to make yourself happy.
