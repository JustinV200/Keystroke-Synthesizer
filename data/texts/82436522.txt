For as long as I know people have argued whether having a more competitive or cooperative spirit is better, and I'm here to express why i think being cooperative is better. Both being competitive or cooperative have their pros and cons, it all just depends on the situtation. Whether you are playing a competitve game, at work, or even just playing sports, their are pros and cons to every situation. 

Being competitive or cooperative in say a video game can make or break the game. While they both have a pretty equal ammount of pros to cons, some cons in being competitve tend to outweigh the pros. On the other hand being cooperative has pros that tend to outweigh the cons depends on the situation in a team based environment you  are so much more likely to come out on top rather than being competitive and trying to do all the work yourself. Having that second set of eyes, ears, and hands can come in handy in rough situations. Some situations may require you to be more competitive like say in a one on one sitiaution, but mpost times being cooperative comes out on top.
 
At the end of the day its really situational, because you could be a playing one player game or even a board game with the family. Most times though being cooperative is what is going to be the most efficient and smart choice to make. Having a competitve spirirt can get in the way of little things when it comes down to crunch time, especially in a cooperative enviroment.
