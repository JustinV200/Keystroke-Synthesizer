     According to the prompt, there are two suggested places that people's happiness comes from.  One such place is "...by pursuing their dreams and their own personal goals."  The other suggested place is by being "...fixed on some goal other than their own happiness."
     In my opinion, happiness comes from the latter suggestion.  I find that I am truley happy when I can do things for other people/society.   This is what brings me the most joy.  I am a teacher and I basically do things for other people for a living.  So, I not only get to feel this happiness, I also get paid for it.  Teaching is very stressful, but also very rewarding.  I also find that simply doing unexpected things for others brings me the same joy.  For example, paying for someone's coffee in line behind you at Starbucks.  Simple idea, but I feel pretty good about it.  Paying for someone's groceries is another thing that I like to do on occasion.
     There are those that would make the arugment that fullfing your own needs first is what brings us happiness.  I agree that meeting our own needs is very important.  This being said, I see it as the first step to being able to meet the needs of others and finding true happiness.  Once our own needs are met, we feel comfortable and secure enough to reach out to others.
    In summary, I believe that the author is this prompt is more correct in saying that it is the pursuit of goals outside of our own direct intrests are what brings us real happiness.  The difference that I make in the world brings me an inner peace that I can't really achieve otherwise.  When all is said and done, those are the actions that matter to me.  In doing so I find happiness.
