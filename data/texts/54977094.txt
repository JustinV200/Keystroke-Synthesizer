I can't tell you the amount of hours were spent with my signfigant other (Sara) at the kitchen table. We would spend hours of intense conversation on various topics and to this day, I would not know what she (Sara) truly wanted. However, I trust that Sara would want me happy and would tell me anything to be sure I was. In a way my happiness was her happiness. So if I was happy, she was happy. Though, in a situation like this, Sara gave into the relationship.

The situation above is my personal expereince and I beleive Sara is like most individuals; where she focuses on the happiness of others directly correlates to her intrinsic value. In the situation above, my happiness correlated to her intrinsic value. So in a way, her happiness was tied to my happiness. Thus, Sara felt happiness when I felt happy. 

Perhaps you might say that Sara might be able to feel happiness focusing on her own goals. Yet, I do not think this is the case. Focusing on self goals might produce happiness, but this happiness is only confidence from acheiving one's own mission. This is mearly the EGO feelings.  And true happiness extends beyound the ego. Thus, one can't be truly happy focusing on other's goal. 

While focusing on the goals of the self, only extends good feelings from the EGO. True happiness extends from not of confidence, but the happiness of others. In the situation above and like Sara, happiness comes from focusing on others.
