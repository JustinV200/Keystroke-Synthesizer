Have you ever played a game online and got tired of playing it? Have you ever played a team game like Apex Legends and said why can't I get better at this game? That is because you are not competitive enough! You will not strive to be better at something if you do not have a drive to be better than others.

By nature, humans are selfish people and want to be better than the next best person. Thats why is world is how it is today which is run by elite billionaires around the world. It got this way by competition. Instead of cooperating with everyone, some individuals take it upon themself to be better than the next guy. They work with as fewer as people as possible creating a smaller and smaller special social circle. Eliminating all competition to essentially win the game so that they can then cooperate together. First is the competition, without it there would be no cooperation. Most all companies are owned by another and our choices are so limited. The most successful organizations and companies are at the top because they have won the competition. Not because they cooperate with other smaller companies to give the consumer the best end product. 

If you rank success by how much money you have and influence you have over the world it is clear that the most "successful" people have done so by winning in a purly competitive market. They want to have the next best product. Sony vs Microsoft? Apple vs Andriod? AMD vs Intel? ATT or Comcast? There are only so limited choices because the competition has been eliminated where no smaller intities can be seen. Its ironic how these intities are called "Corporations" sounds like cooperation but in reality its the complete opposite.
