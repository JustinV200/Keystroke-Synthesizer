Modern society should not be critcized for its hyper materiliastic way of life, however it can be understood by looking back at the past. As far back as man kind goes, we always have fought for survival whether it be gathering food and building shelter or defending ourselves against fierce predators; survival has always come first. It is this basic instict that is still instilled into us to this day and it shows in capitalism. Everybody is fighting to get to the top to fight off some existential fear of not being good enough or just want a better life for their families. Either way, this fight to survive comes from a fear of something worse and we should be more empathetic towards it even if it makes us feel gross.  
     Although humans may be happier in other forms of living that don't involve long hours of work in a week, I believe it is natural what has gotten us here. Human beings always want to see how far they can take something and break boundaries. We push the limit. Take outer space for example, we never even thought there was something outside of earth for a long time, but we kept pushing to understand it. Although it is likely there is no golden ticket at the top of capitalism that reveals some heroic truth, it gives us something to work towards and do in what some feel to be a meaningless life. Capitalism also offers a vessel to form more personal connections with people which can be a meaningful side effect of it. Most older people have a hard time making friends and a work environment may be a perfect place to do it.
   In conclusion, materialism is a natural side effect of human beings that has come to fruition by means of today's society and consumer culture. It is likely there would be a more effective way of live for people, however this is all we got now and we can grow from it.
