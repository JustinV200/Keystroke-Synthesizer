Glue, spray paint, and great lighting. Those are all the essentials that make the Big Mac look mouth-waterlingly delicious on television screens. But this art of lying isn't something that's exclusive to McDonald's, since deception is what's at the heart of most advertising. And it's something that most if not all people place to much value in: images and impressions.

It's a trait that many companies exploit. They hook you, then they sink you. There's the classic one of plastic packaging of all kinds, toys, food, cleaning products. You buy something that's a fairly good enough size, and you forget to read the small print of how much is truly inside it. Then you get home, and, surprise, surprise, the package was about four times too large for the actual product. But it's too late, the company has already has your money.

Another deceitful tactic is the weight loss ads for those clearly sham diet pills, the next convoluted workout machine, or those gimmicky waist wrap belts that claim they'll help you get your desired summer body. I mean, they have the before and after pictures, so they must be telling the truth. But what they don't tell you is that they use different models for both of those pictures to lure you into buying their product.

That's the nature of the business, it's something that in an ideal world would be banned. But for now the only thing the consumer has the power to do, is the ability to look closer into the product. Not just the gimmicky, deceptive, desirable top.
