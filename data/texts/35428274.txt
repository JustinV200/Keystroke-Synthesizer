Here i write an essay about how people achieve more success in cooperation or by competition.In my view cooperation is always best for success in competition there is only one play the major role.but in cooperation there was a group of people and they split there job we can get many ideas from our team we can discuss the merit and demerits.In competion there is no chance for discussion only one can take all decession.

In cooperation the we can save a lot of time by spliting our works and in competition any problem only one wants to face every thing there is one proverb also if we have one stick means we can easily break in a mean while we have bunch of sticks means its not easy to broke it is a major difference between cooperation and competition. So, In order to become successful, we need to be cooperative than being competitive.

Competition is neccessary but not mandatory. With competiton, one can start their action but only with cooperation, anyone can finish the work they started. With cooperation, people can tackle problems easily, we can get many ideas, stick with plans is one of the best part of cooperative. Thus we need to be cooperative than competitive.
