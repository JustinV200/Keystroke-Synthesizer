People will find happiness by pursuing their own goals for several reasons. First, the feeling of accomplishment will boost their self-worth. Second, knowing that they completed something they chose as a goal will give them satisfaction. Lastly, they are able to help others once they have accomplished their own goals and pursued their personal dreams which a family oriented person would feel proud for.
The feeling after you finish something that you have had to put a great deal of effort into is like no other. Sure you might believe that not thinking of your own happiness will eventually lead you to discovering it but after completing something you decided to do, knowing it will not be easy, is something else entirely. You feel a mixture of positive feelings like relief, joy and accomplishment. You knew what had to be done and you did it.
When you focus on the happiness of others as a priority, you neglect your own ambitions and goals. You most likely will not be able to reach your goals and will feel like you have let yourself down. Your sense of self-worth will be very low even though people you have helped and sacrificed for along the way might be better off. In this position you aren't able to do as much for others than if you would have achieved your own goals and obtained financial independence. 
Are people more likely to be happy if the focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others? In short, by neglecting your own goals and ambitions by helping others you will only limit your possibilities to make your dreams come true.  You will not be satisfied with your accomplishments and thus will not be truly happy in the end. Only by focusing on and reaching your goals can you feel accomplished in your life and truly be happy.
