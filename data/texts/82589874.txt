What makes people happy? Does people's happiness depend on helping others or is it from making their dreams come true? I believe happiness can come from helping others, but you can fulfill your own goals while helping others.  What I find is most important is trying. If you do nothing to try to find your own happiness you will never be happy. Its important to alway do something dont give up.
So how can you find happiness? There is no clear cut way with direction you must follow, its never that easy. Anything that is truly genuine is never easy. I would start with helping out at a local shelter or animal shelter. Not only are you helping to make someone else happy you will in return feel good because you did something nice. There is happiness and a sense of satisfication in helping others. Giving back will make anyone happy. 
Being happy in life should be a major goal that we all acheive. Whether it is found by following our own dreams and goals or by focusing on helping others we have to contuine to try. I personally am more likely to be happy if I am focused on something, so I would have to say that people are happier if they are helping others. Doing good in my community is a good way of giving back and if everyone would do the same the world would be a better place.
