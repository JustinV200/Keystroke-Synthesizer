Today we are taking a look at the age old question: Does the person that dies with the most stuff win? The short answer is, "no". In fact, the more "stuff" we all have, the more we all lose. We have become such a materialistic society, most people don't give a second thought to the long term ramifications to our planet and our environment when it comes to all the things we consume and subsequently discard a short time later. People like to obsess over their carbon footprint and are often proud  to live a "green" lifestyle, drive an electric car and act like they care about the environment. What about their junk footprint? They often don't consider the items they discard are often not recyclable and end up in landfills, effective poluting our planet.

Everyone enjoys having nice things. It's one of the reasons we spend 40 or more hours a week at jobs we often don't even like. However, there's something to be said about a minimalist approach. Instead of spending that $100 on something that will be forgotten about in 6 months after it ends up at Good Will (or worse), why not try spending that money a unique experience, the memory of which will last a lifetime?

People often think they things they own define their self worth or social status. The poeple that judge you by the things you own are the people whose opinions don't really matter. Maybe if we are all a little less self-indulgent we can leave the world a little better than we found it and still enjoy life to the fullest.
