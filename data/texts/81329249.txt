People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals.  I think that frees up their mind to take up other tasks such as helping other people be happy.  I would argue that if a person is not personally happy, then it makes it a much tougher job for that person to do a good job helping another person obtain happiness. 
 I believe there is a psycological concept, lazlow's heirachy of needs, that would support this idea.  Basically, you need to reach a certain level of security in your own being in order to be able to branch out and obtain a broader focus.
In my own personal life, I have experienced this.  There were times in my life in which I was not feeling fulfilled and unhappy.  In those instances, I found that I was not very capable of helping others, and in those cases that I found myself helping someone else - my mind and motivation was not really in it and I don't know that I did the absolute best job that I could possibly do.  I think some people might be under the impression that focusing on yourself is selfish, however, I think it could be argued that you have to take care of your own affairs first in order to branch out.
