Does money bring happiness? Yes, but it's only temporary happiness. Is that our problem? Trying to find love in all the wrong places? Society today seems to be too consumed in materalistic possesions in a means that this what happiness looks like. It conveys the wrong message. We need to start critiing those who place too much value in things. It gives out the wrong message that it is the answer to a fulfilling life, makes you superior, and is the meaning of success.

Firstly, a fulfilling life has nothing to do with materalistic things and more to do with you. Buying and spending money on expensive things won't give your any real life meaning, yet still, social media tries to portray that it does. This is whats wrong with modern society. . We need to start questioning those who send out this message and confront them about their own introspection. When we start to do that they might reconsider their need/want for materlistic things.

Secondly, buying things to make yourself feel or seem superior is an issue we need to address. We need to look within and ask ourselves why we feel the need to feel or seem this way. It's a personal problem that no store bought item will or can fix.

Furthermore. the meaning of success is so wrapped up in materalistic things that people are buying fake name brand items just to give off the impression that they're successful. Anyone can do it, it's meaningless and hold no real value. It sends a confusing message for those younger generations. I need a Gucci bag or I'm not a success. We most definitley need to address this issue.
