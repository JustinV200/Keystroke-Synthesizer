You may be able to achieve small wins on your own, but success is best found when you are able to cooperate with others.  Some may feel that success is achieved through competition, but success isn't really success if you are not working with others.  We live in a social world and the ability to have others involved in your success is important.

Most work tasks are performed with others input or will impact others once they are completed.  It's hard to think of a workplace that doesn't have some involvement with other people.  Organizations place individuals on teams to complete work tasks.   Obtaining higher positions in an organization require managers who recognize and are willing to promote.    Even the self employed person has a customer to satisfy.  Higher levels of advancement in organizations require even greater levels of cooperation.  Successful managers or leaders need willing followers.

There are examples such as a olympic athlete that may be engaged in competition with others and win based on their own merit.  Even the olympic athlete requires a team of supportive parents, trainers, or teammates to reach their level of success.  Competition may create innovation, but eventually there is cooperation with others involved in bringing this innovation to completion.  A great idea without others involved, is just an idea.  

The ability to obtain cooperation is a skill that will help those who wish to succeed to greater levels of achievement.  Being able to cooperate with others and work in teams is considered a key skill in most businesses.  Demonstrating skill in this area can assist those who desire to move forward in their career and get ahead.  Having others who champion your ideas is one of the best ways to feel successful in work.
