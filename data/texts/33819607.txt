In the United States, our economy strives on materialism. It is the force behind our expanding consumption. No matter how much we have, it seems that we always want more things. This constant desire to have the best products is the reason we are constantly spending on things we want but likely don't really need.  

This has a negative impact on society for several reasons. It can waste already scarce resources for frivlous means.  For example, do we really need that new sexy iPhone or that fancy pair of Nikes? Landsfills are packed with our discarded junk that we buy to replace with other things. Materialism can cause people to lose their perspective about what is really important in life. They get carried away focusing on material things that may not be as important in the longrun. They expect to buy their happiness and contentment by purchasing meaningless items that may make them look good in a superficial way. This leads to unnecessary jealousy and stress.

However, materialism is not always bad. As Madonna so succintingly puts it, "we are living in a material world" and I must admit that I sometimes love being a "material girl." It can help motivate me to achieve more in life in order to affords all of these luxurious things. It helps me to live in comfort and to enjoy a certain standard of living. In the short-term, I may feel better about myself and I get to impress my friends with my lifestyle.

This is not to say that materialism is desirable in the long-term because it leads to inefficient uses of resources, it makes you a target for envy, and it makes you chase money forever to acquire more things. This shows then that modern society should be rightful criticized for being materialistic.
