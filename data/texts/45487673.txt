Happiness is someonething that is unquely generated within, when you are happy within yourself. When you are without happiness you feel empty and sad from within you.
Personal goal is a lot better than focusing your happiness on other, People can easily let one down and that can lead to a long time sadness. we should always seek out our own happiness in achieving our own goal than any other. Life is short and we have to make a very good use of it to the fullest, and that is to always focus on our personal goal.

Now let go into some example of negativity that is attached to focusing your happiness on others happiness. Let say you help a friend get a good job, in a good company, you have a good connection with the owner of the company and you ensured the owner that your friend is good and can be trusted for the work, this friend of yours give you lot of happiness and you felt so happy to help. When he got employed into the company, he decided to steal the company property and some of their fund, this made the owner of the company furious and angry at you for refering someone like that to his company. In this process your friend has made you sad, so therefore your happiness should shouldn't be focus on happiness of others, because others can let you down at any time.

I will therefore say to you all, be more focused on your personal goal because that will make you more happy and even if there is any mistake along the way, you will fully take responsibility of your error and make corrections to it and thereby gained more experience.

People are indeed more likely to be happy when they focus on their personal goals, because there is nothing as self deserving than making yourself happy and achieving your goals.
