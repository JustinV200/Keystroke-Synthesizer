It is not necessary to criticize the modern society for being materialistic. It has its own meaning from each and everyone's perspective. Liking and spending depends on one's thoughts and its resultant actions. Our whole world is materialistic in its own way. But the way money or time spent should be in the right way to achieve the materialistic thought. 

There should be some purpose in spending on materialistic things. sometimes what we think and buy may be necessary initially while purchasing, but it may go unnessary later on. Simple just some thoughts must become materislistic at the end. It should not evolve materialistic just for the sake of thoughts. There must be some usage and meaningfulness in the process of materialising.

It should not be measured in terms of money. It should become or fulfilled as one's own likes and dislikes. It is the one's own basic value in life. For some it may be a passion grown from a long time. So it should not be confused between materialistic or something else. Everyone has their own rights of thinking and materialising the same. Until it become materialistic, its just mere a thought. It depends upon their mindset which cannot be controlled. Thoughts become realistic which are supposed to become so only if it is materialised.
