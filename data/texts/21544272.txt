Materialism is the core principal of capitalist society. Consumption of goods and services is a main contributor to our daily lives. We are all driven to earn more and consume more, but is that the true path to happiness? I will argue that it is not.

Modern society should look at our matrialistic consumption more critically. We need to exemine our connection to the Earth and nature and to better understand what would protect the planet, environment and humanity equally. 

In the last 50 years or more capitalism has pushed extreme consumption on all of us. Companies outsourced jobs overseas because of cheap labor and flooded our market with cheap goods. And we were happy to spend our dollars on more and more stuff. Highly paid executives also thought out a new scheme to make more money, one-time use items you can just throw away when youre done. Landfills are full of single use cups, plastic bags etc., materials that pollute our environment. Unregulated fosil fuel industry also polluted the air with CO2 gasses causing green house effect and climate change. We need to change our consumtion now to protect us in the future.

Sceptics argue that climate change isn't real and that materialism is a major driving factor that lifts all boats equally. They claim that companies should not be regulated because that will slow down inovation and progress for all.
No matter what counter arrguments say facts are clear. We all leave on the same planet and we should enact global regulations to protect our environment and our planet. 

We also need to change our culture, to stop celebrating billionaires who take 15 min private jet flights and start publicly shaming them. And our work culture needs to change as well, we need to spend more time with family and friends and less time working.

I rest my case. :)
