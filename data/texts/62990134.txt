Materialism is something that many of us experience in our lives. What is materialism? Materialism is the acquisition of items by spending money. You may have heard the phrase "keeping up with the Joneses". That phrase is a perfect example of materialism. But are we too materialistic? Does it really give our lives purpose? That answer will vary depending on who you ask.

There are benefits and disadvantages to our materialistic lifestyles. Materialism can create more jobs and opportunities for people to make a living. If people did not have a desire to purchase anything other than what is necessary, much less items would be produced in the world, leading to fewer available jobs. Materialism can also bring happiness into peoples lives by giving them things to look forward to and providing them with something to do on their free time, such as playing video games or watching movies.

Materialism can also cause a lot of harm. It contributes to more waste from all of the purchases and packaging being thrown away, and causes pollution from the creation of materials. It can also cause people to care too much about items and not enough about the people around them. Many people work more than necessary so that they can purchase things that they don't need. This may bring them happiness, but for how long?

So, should modern society be criticized for being materialitic? There is no correct answer. Materialism can cause just as much harm as it can produce benefits. I do believe some people would have a difficult time adjusting to a world that was not so focused on materialism, but a reduction could strengthen our bonds with each other as we focus on people and less on items.
