I think to achieve more success both cooperation and competition is required. Some times few work alone not possible to do. So if we can do together by cooperation it will be very easy to get more success. On the other hand to get success if competition is going on then we can get more success. 

For an example few task due to difficultness we might avoid and if we notice other person is doing same task and he is success then I will think if he can do why I will not be able to do. I think this type of competition is very much required in our society to achieve success and then personally people will be benefitted as wel as society will be benefited.

Normally in our society some people are very scared to do difficult task on the other hand some people like to take risk and doing difficult task and majority time they are success. So who are sscared those people could be inspired and they also will try to take risk and finally will get success. That is why my personal perception is cooperation and competition both can be play a vital role to achieve success. Every people are not equally talented so less talented people can follow them who is more talented.
