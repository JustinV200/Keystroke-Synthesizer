The pursuit of happines is one of the fundamental rights of being an American. But how does one pursue happiness? Is it tied to personal goals related to career or wealth accumulation? Would you count yourself happy if you reach a certain number of friends or followers on your social media accounts? How do relationships with family and friends tie in? 

I submit that the most effective way to pursue happiness starts with two simple steps: (1) put your own life in order and (2) become part of something bigger than yourself. "Put your own life in order" means that you have come to a point in your life where you are financially independent, emotionally stable, and are completely responsible for your life. Nobody has to worry about how you are doing everyday or where you will end up at the end of your life. You are a strong, useful member of society. The next logical step would be to take on more responsibility in things bigger than yourself. For many, this takes the form of religion and charity. For others, it can be environmentally or politically driven. Whatever the cause, becoming part of something bigger than yourself gives your life meaning, and meaning has the side-effect of producing happiness. Keep in mind that the order of these steps matters! The first step is vastly more important than the second. Someone who has not put their life together should not prioritize impacting others. In other words, putting your life in order is the beginning of happiness. 

While there may be many different paths to happiness, not all paths are created equal. Some paths take too many detours, forcing you to back-track miles. Others promise happiness but take you in the opposite direction. If you strive to be responsible for yourself and commit yourself to leaving the world a better place than you found it, finding happiness is all but guaranteed.
