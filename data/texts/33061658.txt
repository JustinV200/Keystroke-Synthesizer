Materialism is a subject that that is pivotal to our perceptions of modern society. Many have raised the spectre of materialism as a destructive force that has separated human civilization from its roots in our needs for basic sustenance and social cohesion, and substituted largely unobtainable individual goals of acquisition and display of wealth for its own sake. Others have celebrated the accumulation of capital as intrinsic to the rapid acceleration of technology and standards of living in the modern world. I will offer that since we as humans inhabit an indubitably material world, that materialism in a real sense is inescapable, but that focus on accumulation of material wealth might best be seen a short-sighted if taken as an end in itself rather than a means for furthering human prosperity, inspiration and happiness.

Materialism has been a salient aspect of civilization since people began gathering and sheltering together. Artifacts have served the purposes of providing means for acquiring food, building structures, recording knowledge, and symbolizing community beliefs, values, and the levels of individual and societal wealth. It is this last, mostly symbolic purpose (albeit on with very real, tangible benefit to the holders of wealth) that comes in for the most critical appraisals. To a large degree, human societies are structured based on the acquisition and holding of wealth as an indicator of status and power. Where individuals hoard wealth and power, materialism often has a demoralizing and ultimately destabilizing effect on social hierarchies. I would argue that this is a psychological effect related to the use of material acquisition as a weapon. The admiration of  material wealth can often lead to a perverted sense of the value of wealth in itself, rather than its utility when used for the greater good.
