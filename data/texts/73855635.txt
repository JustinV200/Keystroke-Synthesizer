Materialism is very common nowadays.  People accumulate wealth and mateirals to satisfy their ego and to show that they have everything to the society.   In modern society mateiralism is very common and accepted by many people.

People tend to acquire many materials like house , car,  jewelry, furnitures to show their weath to the outside world.  They think anything can be possible with money and in this way they satisfy their ego.  They want to be on top of everything they do.

Material is only a temporary thing according to me.   By achieving things by hard work gives more satisfaction than by getting easily with money.  Many achievers do not possess any money.  They live a simple life and prove their intelligence by their ability.  But the materialistic people think they are only smart which is not true.  I would like to live a simple life than luxury.  This way you feel more pleasure and satisfaction. The people with more money have only money and materials but no peace of mind.  I always encourage people to be satisfied with what they have and should not feel jealous of people who have the expensive material.

I think people who achieve the things in life are great.  They  will set  as an example to others in society. So material in life will not give full satisfaction.  I am always in favor of simplicity than materialism.
