        THINGS are destroying us. Things are needed BUT things ruin us. Things bring about so much physical clutter we cannot maintain clean enviroments.

         Why does a person have so many clothes, shoes, jackets, plates, cups and boxes of stuff stuffed in every corner.

          The more stuff we have the more dissatisfied we are with our life. We even pay big bucks to store our stuff that most likely we will never see again once it is put into storage. WHY do we do this?

    We do need things. But not more than 5 or six of each item. IF the chair breaks fix or replace. DO NOT replace and put in a corner to fix later. LATER never gets here. 

      Kids do not need a house full of toys. The less clutter-the happier the child and parent.
Animals do not need a dozen balls to chase. If your car wears out get rid of it - -don't park it in the driveway for years and years.

   Each individual needs to criticize and correct the behavior of to much stuff. The more stuff--the more dust and bacteria and plain frustration. Clean up and clear out and live in a nice clean enviromant for a good healthy change.

     Some people say save it. It may be needed tomorrow. MAYBE. If it cost a lot to replace --save one - - if not just get rid of it.

        A family tv draws the family together. A tv in every room separates the family. This is not a good thing.

        THINGS do not create happiness for anyone. Things create work that take time that could be used for enjoying the company of those we love.

 Materialism should be a huge no no for every one of us at all times.
