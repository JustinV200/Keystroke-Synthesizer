i believe people are more happy when they focus on their own personal goals. Happiness is definne different for everyone, but for me when one is focused on themselves they tend to be more happy. the pursuit of happiness is found within and only one knows what makes them happy. 
the reasonn i believe focusing on yourself helps with happiness is because when one reached their goals no matter what circumstance they always smile. for instance, i am a an athlete and i set a goal to win a trophy, aand in order to win that trophy i start working out hard in order to be shape. when i eventually become in top shape and go compete in that trophy and i eventually win it, the joy i will have on my face will be enourmous because i know amount of work i put in to get this trophy. i will be full of joy and excitement, there fore for me when one focuses on themselves it tends to make them more happy. 
despite me believing focusing on yourself bring more happiness, i also believe that is not the only way to bring happiness, there are multiple ways to bring happiness and one has to be willing to find that within. in life what you do desire to do make sure it makes you happy whether that means you make yourself happy or someone else makes you happy.
