Happiness is a topic that has enthralled man for many years. But we still often wonder today how one can make themselves happy. SOme argue that one can do so by being invested in their own personal goals, while some believe they can achieve happiness by making others happy. I believe both things can make one happy.
My reasoning is that happiness is different to each individual. I can not decide what makes another person happy, nor can another person determine what makes me happy. I get happiness from making others happy, as well as achieving my own personal goals. Yet another person may achieve happiness from one of the two ways, and some may be unsure of how to achieve happiness. Ultimately, each person's happiness is individual to that person.
In conclusion, both being invested in ones own happiness as well as investing in the happiness of others can make a person happy as happiness is unique to each individual. No one person can decide what determines happiness for others. For some, happiness may come in a multitude of methods, while for others it may only come in a singular method. Whatever the case, we can agree that the pursuit of happiness is a common goal among most humans.
