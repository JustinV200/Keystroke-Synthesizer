     Materialism is when people only care about aquaring more and more physical things. A materialistic person doesn't care about people, only things. Materialism is harmful for modern society and should be critisized and I'll tell you why.
      When people become materialistic they lose a sense of their spiritual self. Materialistic people are usually selfish people. A materialistic person would do anything to aquire more things, even if that means lying, stealing, and cheating to get it. When society becomes materialist we stop caring about other people. I don't think there are unlimited resources in this world for everyone. I belive the more someone has, the less another person has. I think a prime example of a materialistic society is when the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. There is more to life than aquiring more things. If modern society wasn't so materialistic, people would help each other more. People look down on other people in a materialistic society. For example, someone driving a Mercedes Benz might look down on someone that drives a Toyota. The only good thing I could say about materialism is when someone wants something they'll work hard for it. But we should work hard at making the word a better place instead of working hard to consume more.
     In conclusion, modern society should be critisized for being materialistic. If modern society wasn't so materialistic the world wouldn't be as messed up as it is right now. Wars and climate change are just two of the many things plaguing modern society. If we lose our materialistic natures then we will learn to love and care for our fellow man, women, and animal.
