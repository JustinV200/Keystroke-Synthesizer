   I do not think that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. I believe the main reason people criticize others is because they are jealous of the things they have. They may not be in a position to get certain things as easily as other people. They simply may not have enough money.  However, the reasons they give may include wastefullness instead of admitting they are actually jealous. They may say things like having so much stuff is bad for the environment.When in reality, they are envious. 
   First of all, people should be able to have whatever they desire. They work hard for their money. It is none of society's business how the money is spent. If what you buy makes you happy, that is really all that matters. Sometimes it comes down to having the financial means to acquire things. If you have the money, and want something, get it! The money does not go with us when we die.
   Our society needs to stop being judgemental. If you enjoy spending money to get the things you want in life,  then don't let anyone make you feel bad for doing so. You only get one go at this life. Do whatever makes you feel happy. Live your best life!
