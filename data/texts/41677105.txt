     A question as old as time, whether or not cooperation or competitiveness is better in the work place. I fill believe as someone who is in a cut-throat job market (real-estate) that both can be beneficial depending on the type of work environment you are in.
     Sales and other commission based professions most likely beenfit more from a competitive stand point as you are trying to out perform others in the same market, especially real-estate. Professions such as engineering that keep and entire production plant aloat would more likely benefit from a cooperative standpoint as you need all legs to work properly for the plant to function. Some jobs such as retail work can take both of these factors in to account and perfom well. The cooperative side between workers and supervisors keeps a happy and healthy work place, while the salesman or front workers might be slightly competitive as a way to either make a better commission or earn a promotion faster than the other workers.
     In conclusion, both a cooperative and a competitive work environment will always have both pros and cons, but at the end of the day end up being benefifical for companies to be successful.  It is impossible to say one is better than the other or should be solely used as it would be unbalanced in the fields it does not thrive in.
