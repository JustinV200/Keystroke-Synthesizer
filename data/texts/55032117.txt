 I think it is a combination of both in order to be happy. I think you need to reach your own personal goals to some degree in order to be able to even focus on the happiness of others. Maslow's heirarchy of needs is why I say that.

 If you can't establish you're own personal goals and accomplish some of them. Then you will have nothing to really share with others in order to help them with their happiness. I think the most satisfactory one however, is the helping others and focusing on their happiness. I think you will feel the best by making others happy, but how much of that can you enjoy if you yourself are not happy with where you are at.

 Happiness to me comes from helping people who are in need. Like I am the type of person to give somebody any extra I may have. Now, if I don't have extra then of course I can't give anything. Then I feel like I feel more bad by not being able to give anything. You're own personal goals will lead to a long-lasting satisfaction and happiness. Whereas, helping somebody else will be a short burst of a feel good. 

 I think you should always help others out when the chance arises. As long as you can provide and have a home and food, then helping others should be a priority. If you help those people acheive their goals, now you have connections that could possibly benefit you in the future.
