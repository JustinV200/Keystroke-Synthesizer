What makes you happy? The answer is easy for some - a sunny day, the smell of fresh baked cookies, encountering a small animal. Others find the question a bit trickier as happiness can be an elusive emotion. How do we stay consistently happy?

Personal, obtainable goals can lead to greater feelings of happiness, but can also be confused with pride. These rewarding tasks generally require great investment in time and energy, only to bring feelings of elation that tend to dissipate quickly, leading to a pursuit with no finish line. 

Helping others is a something that can deliver happiness on a daily basis. Small gestures of respect are easiest to accomplish, such as holding a door for someone, greeting a stranger on the street, or just recognizing that someone is struggling. To accomplish consistent levels of happiness, it is best to be an example of kindness, tolerance, and empathy. When you start helping others and receive sincere thanks, the world slowly becomes a brighter and more positive place. 

People are not quick to forget a scenario in which a stranger has helped them, even in the smallest ways. I am sure you have an example of this in your life, and if not, you have been that example for someone else. While personal goals are important for the individual, they don't do much to help the whole. Hitting a goal weight, or landing a new job have the potential to draw ire and jealousy, essentially transferring happiness from one person to another rather than creating it.

To lead a truly happy and fulfilling life, focusing on other peoples needs, wishes, and goals is essential. "One good turn deserves another" and "pay it forward" are idioms that may still be popular, but their actions need to be exercised as often as possible. Next time the opportunity presents itself, do some good for yourself and everyone else by choosing the kind, caring action and bask in your genuine happy glow!
