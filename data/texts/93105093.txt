                         To achieve more  success i think that co operation is  the one of best think i have  learned with out co operation there is nothing  sucess. In competation we can only do what other did but in co operation we can do many  thing .Success is a part of the life but pepole they wish to get success by their own .One thing i remember that sucess and failure are the combination of life when we are in a competion we can win in sometime but failure also a part  of life .A single men cannot build up a company and run it in success but,if a team works they can do it if there is no co operation in the ,managemnt we cant see the sucess .I think that to achieve a new thing co operation is the best way to get the sucess . A competition make a one man sucess but a co opreation makes a whole team success we can get success through only by co opeation . so i think that many of the peole acheieve the success by cooperation .Co operation make them feel the success is in the whole team i n co operation we can do hard things easier than possible . so i think co operation is the best way to achieve success.
