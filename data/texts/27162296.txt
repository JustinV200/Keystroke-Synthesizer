     Happiness is a feeling that people strive for their entire life. Sometimes it's a feeling that is easily found, and sometimes people feel like they're always searching for it. Happiness truly comes from within. It is up to the person to figure out what brings them pleasure. 

     It may sound easier than it actually is to do this because we constantly hear about the unhappiness in our world. There is one thing for certain though, and that is that no one will find happiness if they are focused on others rather than themselves. It may sound selfish, but similary to what was mentioned before, happiness comes from within. When we focus on others too much, our own needs sometimes get left behind or forgotten. We must dig down deep to figure out what makes us happy. Whether that is spending time with family, spending time alone, or doing a hobby, reaching a person goal; whatever truly brings the person a feeling of pleasure is their happiness. If you go about your life focused on the happiness of others, then you ultimately will not end up happy.

     Happiness can feel confusing sometimes, it may even feel difficult to reach. It may take some time for one to figure out where their happiness comes from, but that is the most difficult part. As soon as one focuses on themselves, rather than the others around them, happiness will easily come to them.
