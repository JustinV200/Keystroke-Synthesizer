In today's economy the accumulation of wealth happens across social classes. The upper classes are the most materialistic. They can afford luxuries while the lower classes cannot. This leads to crime in the lower classes. Some believe in the equal distribution of wealth, but in our competitive economy this is contrary to the work ethic that we earn what we get. We are not a welfare state.                                                                                                                       While there are many injustices some believe that competition is good for the economy and encourages growth and quality. Otherwise workers are unmotivated to meet production levels. To some this is forced labor. They think that a more social approach is the better motivater. They reject the survival of the fittest method as unfair and contrary to social justice. In our society competiton does work broadly, and has many good results. Those who are left behind have to fend for themselves or rely on government handouts to survive. The economy is healthy and most are able to manage to survive. For the haves and the have nots it is just tough luck, you have to grin and bear it. But the middle and upper classes are content. It is just the lower class that suffers when it comes to material wealth.
In our society it generally accepted that those who earn it have the right to material wealth, the rest have to find some other means to live even if it is illegal. That is a flaw in the system, that is inherent in the economy. That is the result of the free market that has been in place for hundreds of years. So there is a good side and a bad side to this economy. Maybe in the future things will be different. Changes in population and climate may require the government to step in and impose controls in the end.
