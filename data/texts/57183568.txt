Success may be found by being competitive and possibly trampling others in order to reach your goals, but using cooperation to achieve the same thing has longer lasting benefits. Being competitive is a lonely job, and you might end up with fame or fortune, but no one with whom to share it.

In order to have a fulfilling and productive life, regardless of goals, the best path is to be agreeable to cooperate with others and help them to achieve as well. The more you're willing to encourage, mentor or teach, the greater your rewards will be. 

Let's take a look at the life and career of Blake Nicholas. Blake showed early talent and was winning competitions before the age of 10. They never took the time to make friends or have relationships because there was always one more goal to reach. When Blake's talent started to wane, there was nobody there to be supportive because Blake hadn't made time along the way to reach out to others. Blake died alone in an empty house.

If Blake had slowed down and trusted others, they could have had a substantial career AND the joy of a family and relationships to give warmth and deeper meaning to living every day.

So it would behoove you to be cooperative and supportive along the path of life. You'll reap the rewards more than you can imagine. Build a foundation that will endure.
