I do feel that images and impressions have too much of an effect on our society. Too often, people are put on a pedestal due to their looks, or how many followers that they have on social media. We care too often about how "attractive" someone or something is, but that is only on the surface level. Deep down, those things offer no value to our lives, and we wouldn't even notice them if they weren't there because we are so quick to move on to the next thing that catches our eye.

In order to combat this type of activity, it is important that we take time to think about what's really important to us. These surface novelties in life aren't necessarily a high priority, and taking an hour or so out of your day to figure out what's really benefitting you shouldn't be a difficult task. In turn, I believe that we could find better hobbies/interests that would help better serve us in the long run. By minimizing the importance of what doesn't serve us, our attitudes will greatly change.

Ultimately, it is important that we open up ourselves psychologically to somewhere that's not always our comfort level. By only catering to those based on how they appear, you run the risk of getting "played" to an extent. Eventually, you come to realize that that brand of toothpaste was just clever marketing; your teeth aren't actually getting whiter. You come to realize that the financial guru on Instagram isn't worth as much as he says. All of these things eventually become so minor if you learn to focus on what truly matters to you and those surrounding you.
