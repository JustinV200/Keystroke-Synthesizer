Whether someone would find more happiness in achieving personal goals or by making sure those around them are happy comes down to an individual person and what drives them. I believe a mixture of the two is the secret to life. You see, you can experience great joy from knowing you helped someone in need. Or, take for example, someone who tries to be the best wife and mother and solely focuses on the needs of her family. But what about your own needs and desires? 

If a person chooses to devote all their time and energy into the happiness of others around them, it becomes unsustainable after some time. As would be the same case with someone who only focuses on themselves and pursuing their dreams. We need both of these things, the freedom to be able to do what we want in life, to seek out and learn ourselves and find those things that put a smile on our face. It's good to have goals and achieve them but you shouldn't be so hyperfocused on that, that you never see the humans around you who may need you. We are a collective community and one of the main purposes of life is to help others.

In contrast, those who give up their own dreams or don't have the time for personal goals because they put so much emphasis on the happiness of others, they're really missing out. Missing out on what it means to truly fall in love with your life, to feel accomplished that you did something for YOU and no one else. We only live once. We should take a healthy approach and balance the two delicately in order to maximize happiness.
