Happiness is something that should come from within yourself. Having a sense of self and focusing on  personal goals in life can lead to happiness in many ways. When you tend to work on yourself and stay in the line of sight of what you what to acheive in life it sets a postive tone and mood of happiness. I definitely think that if you focus on your personal goals in life there would be many happy and joyful moments throughout life.

Setting goals and sticking to them will only help you grow stronger and stay on course with what you what to do in life rather it be long or short term. Writing down pros and cons of personal goals can help you grow as well. It would be good to keep a journal to keep yourself on track. You could also write the many ways your personal goals made you happy in some type of way and being appreciative of any outcome.

People are more likely to give themselves therapy in some sort of way and self care when feeling happy or building it up over the course of time. It is a good feeling inside when you focus on yourself especially if you have some weak areas in those cons to work on. Work the cons out daily to experience something happy that you've acheived daily. They can be great building blocks for overall life goals.

Overall, happiness, happy times, and happy moments can all be personal goals you can focus on. When you are happy it definitely shines on the inside and outside... giving off a good ora overall. Last, but not least happy isn't something that is a quick fix. When you truly focus on yourself (and personal goals in life) happiness can last a lifetime and you never know who it may rub off on.
