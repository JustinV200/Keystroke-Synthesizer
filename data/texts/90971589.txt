People are the most important things our lives. Without people... we're nothing. Just a lonely existance. Forever alone. We need people in our lives to grow as humans.

Imagine having no friends. How empty would your life be? You'd have nothing to do. Nothing to really look forward to. You can go to the movies or a resturant or wherever... but without anyone to share the experiences with, what's the point? It's fine to have goals for sure. Focusing on yourself for self improvement is fine too. What good is having nothing to strive for besides yourself?

Having people cause problems in your life is great in a way too! It gives you obstacles to overcome. It gives you challanges. Imagine the same thing, day in, day out. Conflict gives people things to strive for. Wanting things in life is great. Striving to better yourself out of spite is a good thing.

Then we have the mating process. If you REALLY didn't care what other people thought, you'd not be striving for degrees, cars, nice homes, nice shoes. The list is endless. I know I want to impress women in my life. It makes me happy when people I like succeed and it makes me happy when I succeed in life. Makes me more attractive.

With focuses on friends and family, we can be happy on the inside. We can get everything we need in life. People to help you and people who can rely on you if they have a problem. It's fun to be useful and face challange head on. It's wonderful to set goals and acheive. The key to personal growth is relationships.
