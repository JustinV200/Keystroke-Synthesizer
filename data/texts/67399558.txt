Introduction:
Happiness are important part of our life. Everyone wants to be happier in life. Happiness comes from different things for different people for example some find happiness in earning more money, some in spending money. Some people get happiness by doing the jobs which they like the most. While categorizing the happiness, people get happiness either pursuing their own dreams and goals or helping other people. Either ways people wants to live happier in life. In this essay I will discuss how helping others will be more keep you more happier than doing your personal stuffs. 

My position: My stand in this is essay is one get more happiness from the happiness of the others. In my opinion, even achieving your own dreams is a part of a process of making others happy (it may be your family, friends or relatives).

Reasons and evidence: In my prespective, we will start with our own family. In a family the person is working hard for keeping his family happier. He sacrifices all his comforts to make his family happier, which will instead make him feel more happier and proud. You will happy only when your family, your environment and your surrounding are happier. Even if you achieve your personal goals and dreams, you feel the happiness only when others are happy about it. The person should not stop at his own family level. If he helps other people also he will be more happier. Even small helps to others will make you feel happier and help in pursuing your own goals more comfortably in your life.

Counterarguments: Some people think that people will be more happy when you achieve your dreams. Although a part of it true, you will happy about your achievements only when others feel happy about your achievements.

Conclusion: Be happy by helping others, this will also help you achieve your own goals. In my opinion people more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of the others.
