In this world, people are usually get attracted towards the appearance. Like fireflies getting attracted towards the lights, people always rushes towards the objects that glitters. There are two popular sayings conveys that one should not judge by outer appearance. Those sayings are "All that glitters are not gold" and "Don't judge a book by its cover". 

Some people will have the ability to judge others on their first meet, but their perception might not always be true. Sometimes they have change their judgements. In current scenario most of us are hiding behind a mask. Everything is created to view like a perfect one. And we people blindly fall for them without knowing what is hidden behind the curtain.

Most people will think that whatever displayed is their or its true color and not ready to disguise them. Everyone is afraid to see what is inside just looking at the outer appearance, they get satisfied. One can ask, is everything in the world has dark secrets? is there nothing pure and transparent?. I won't say that everythink is impure, there is certain things which are transparent, but they are very rare and people will not let them out. 
I conclude that all the promotions shows only the positive side hiding their negativity. No one is willing to reveal their originality. Also, everyone wants only the beautiful side not the dark ones!
