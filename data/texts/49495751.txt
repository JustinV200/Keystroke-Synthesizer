I believe the idea of competition versus cooperation in regards for achieving success can be compared to the idea of winning or losing a war. In war, cooperation is needed to compete and win a war.

I feel that people acheive more success by cooperation rather than competition in certain situations. During a competition, only winning is important, and nothing else matters. In a cooperative effort, a common goal is shared among individuals and they all are striving to help each other achieve said goal.

Sure, one can think of a team competition event such as in sports, where one is reliant on cooperating to compete, so to speak. However, in medicine or science for example, everyone in those respective fields are cooperating towards the goal to heal and mender the unfortunate. Whether it be to cure disease, finding new therapeutics, or helping others. Competition towards who can achieve more in this context seems like more egotistical than altruistic.

Depending on the perspective, one can find similarities in differences between cooperation and competition. Sometimes, a team has no choice but to compete while also cooperating in order to achieve success.

While rivalry and competition may offer a push to do better in some circumstances, it is ultimately cooperation that drives the effort to achieve more in the long term.
