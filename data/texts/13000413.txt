     Whether a person is more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or if they focus on the happiness of others completely depends on what kind of person they are. Some people can choose to focus on the happiness of others to their own detriment and end up ignoring their own needs and never find happiness. Others can chase their own dreams and find that this never truly brings them happiness.
     Some people might say that it is objectively the right thing to do when you focus on the happiness of thers, and maybe they are right but this doesn't mean it will bring you happiness. Focusing on the happiness of others is more of a self sacrifice thing and whether it brings you happiness personally depends on your specific psychology. Focusing on the happiness of others as a way to make yourself happy may work for you, but then again it may not.
     On the other hand, focusing entirely on your own goals and dreams may or may not bring you happiness. I think this is because people don't really have a good grasp on what actually will make them happy. They choose to chase money or status, believing this will make them happy only to find that they feel empty once they achieve their goals. Although some people might instinctively know what will make them happy and go for it without any doubts. 
      At the end of the day, what makes a person happy is a very personal thing and not always easy to determine. Some can assume the path to happiness is self sacrifce, only to find out that they've neglected themselves. Others can assume that they need to follow their own dreams only to find out that they never knew what they wanted in the first place. So I don't think either path is gauranteed to lead you to happiness, but you should keep an open mind and try different things to figure out what will actually be rewarding to you as an individual.
