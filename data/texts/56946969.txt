Happiness is more than skin deep. Many different aspects of happiness and the search for it can be found within yourself. But, to get to the true root of happiness, you have to set out to help others and treat others with kindness.

Personal goals are the aim in life to try to become something or achieve a certain level of success...or at least attain something. You can strive to attain a lot of money. You can try to reach a certain level of success within a company. You can even try to seek solace in finding satisfaction with personal goals that you get to by using any disposable means you have. All of these things are great things to aim for and achieve. 

The real goal should be to help others though because you gain perspective on the plight of others and the struggles they go through. You also gain insight into the fact that you are not the only one in the struggle. You may gain friends you never knew or thought you would have. You may gain knowledge to unanswered personal issues you have had. You could even find a romantic partner you may have never even considered.

The arguement can be made that it would be monumental in your life to have the biggest, fanciest and most attractive things in life. But, having the experiences with others is much more gratifying. Think about it like a football team that wins the National Championship. If the team wins, every player on the team has a memory and an accolade to think about for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, if the team loses but the QB passes for 500 yards and 5 TD's, the QB is the only one achieving a form of personal success.

In conclusion, the satisfaction you will gain from helping others can manifest itself in many different forms of happiness. The gain of achieving happiness with others far outweighs the gain going it alone.
