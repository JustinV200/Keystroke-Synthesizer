     From my point of view competition is needed to encourage the people to succeed in their way.One success will motivate the person to work more intent fully in their work or in their skill.In competition success is not the only thing failure is the main thing.A person can not get success in their life until they face a failure.Success only gives jolly and happiness but failure will push every one to achieve their goals.
One success  can not be the final stage for their ambition.
     Success just notify us that we are going in the correct way in our life.And failure notifies that we have to give more concentration and hardwork to reach our dreams.
     But  in cooperation we can not reach our goals.cooperation make us to lazy and that make us to be satisfy with what we had.To achieve our goal we have to concentrate in one dream and can not giveup our goals for anyone and any reason at any time.We need a fire to be what we want and to reach the position where we decided to be in.For this people must be more active and hardworking ,need the competition instead of coopeative behaviour.So,competition is the best thing to achieve our goals.
