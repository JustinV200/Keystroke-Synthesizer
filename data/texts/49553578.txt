So, it is quite clear that the first  important is the last imperssions. Nobody gets the  second change to create the first  impressions. so we should make the best use the it . Our future meetings depend on this. our first impressions should be such that  people may not be able to forget us for a long time.

Another thing which is noticed in the meeting is whatwe say. our words reflecect our thoughts and optinions on any topic. the words, which come out of  our mouth, are a mirroor of our personality. so we should always think twice before  speaking anything our postures, looks and behaviour also play an important role in it Also we should give proper importance to the person sitting front of us. His thoughts and posture also denote his qualities.

For this very reason it is said that one should make a good impression it beacomes very difficult to change that impression later. often people make a picture or image of our character with the help of the  impressions we have made. Aftterwards they  judge us according to that. Whenever we meet somebody for the first time,  we should be filledwith confidence . if we are nervous, we will not ableto present ourselves properly we should try to conctrate and stable our mind during the metting.
