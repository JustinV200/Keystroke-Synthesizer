To compete or not is the question. 
We live in a competitive world.  We want to be surrounded by winners.  We don't celebrate the losing team, we hold victory dances for the winners and put them on pedestals.  Do we hold winners to a higher level than what they deserve?

In life there are winners and losers, but losing does not mean you failed.  It means you set a goal and worked hard to be the best.  Sometimes there is someone better than you and they are the successor, but that does not mean you lost.   You have to learn to take something from not being victorious.

If you worked as a team to achieve success you could all compete against each other to try and reach the goal, however if you did not cooperate with your team the outcome could end up disasterous.  Not communicating to each other and sharing ideas could lead to an epic fail.   

Cooperating and working together on a project, and succeeding as a group effort can be just as, or more rewarding than doing it all on your own.  Sometimes putting the competition aside and cooperating with those around you; colaberating ideas and sharing insight is more important than the actual win. 

In our world we have so much competition to achieve greatness.  We have set such high standards for being winners.  We have set some up for failure by forcing competition in so many aspects of life.  We need to focus more on working together and building relationships where everything isn't about competing.  Focusing more on the task at hand and how everyones input is valued and everyone is cooperating to reach the same goal.  

Cooperation working together; not competition fighting forever!
