      The appearance may not be what it seem. Weve heard these words before but do we really beleive it? We are here to answer that question, because society has come to a point where it is more important to look cool than to be smart. In older times, it used to be that it didnt matter what you wore or how you looked, but more what was on the inside. Increasingly in our world today, people are just the opposite, and more stuck up than ever.
       The images that we see on Tv have a huge affect on the current generation of youngsters, but also increasingly grown adults are becoming much less than there ages by trying to act younger. We have 30 to 40 year old and beyond adults that have snapchat and instagram pages, the same apps that teenagers use to be social with their friends. These grown adults are neglecting their responsibilities, their kids, and even their own lives in order to live in front of their cell phone admiring the image of someone else. I think it has caused our society to be much more stupid and easily distracted than ever, and if we dont do something about it now times may change for good.
       The media is a huge problem in creating this vibe as well. They poster all over their tvs celebrities and prop them up in front of you to tell you how they live or do things. Political news networks use celebrities as pawns to gains votes by making them appear to be better people than they really are. Everyone has a right to look at their phone, but how much damage are we doing to our youth by showing them that this never quits, and you qill be addicted for life? We are doing a ton, and if we don't stop it now, we can kiss our current way of life goodbye. If consumers would quite buying into the advertisers every word, they wouldnt spend millions to keep us preoccupied.
