     I think that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals. You must learn to take care of and love yourself before you can truly focus and commit to the needs of others, therefore people would be happier focusing on their own personal goals. 

     Life is a long journey through which we discover alot about not only the world around us, but also about ourselves. What motivates us? What makes us tick? What makes us happy? What is it that we really want?  These are things we find out about ourselves along the way. You might ask, "well, what if along the way you figure out that making other people happy is what I enjoy?" Well, I would say that in discovering this about yourself, you have confirmed that this is what makes you happy, thus making it a personal goal of yours, which supports my argument. In pursuing your personal goal to make others happy, you are in turn making yourself happy by doing so. 

     Although you might consider this a chicken or the egg type of argument, you can see that even when your focus is on making other people happy, you are still focusing on your own personal desire to do so, thus making yourself happy as well. You are fullfilling a personal goal. There is nothing wrong with this, but in doing so, you are ultimitely still focusing on your own personal goal, which is making other people happy.
