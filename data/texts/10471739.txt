I think the main key to get a more success is competition rather than cooperation. it will makes always you to do better than other in any field.

Because competition tends you to create greater cooperation for you to succeed more.competitions and cooperations are not opposite because the competition is neccessary for copperative .

If I am a copetitive  brings me a sharp and significant at al the times. coperation can acheive excellence success withoud the lead of competition.

true cooperation can benefit you to well in business sector.In the world some one choose only a competition as a only way to success in their life, other were in the power of cooperation.

I suggest both are must to lead an successful life .Intensive may leads to avoid failure it is very good but to acheive an success cooperation is also an part .

With growth and development always happened around the world, and the were bonding between competition and cooperative is also started raising.

Naturally human beings are social species they relies only on cooperative to survive.Competition can motivate employees to get an better results.

Competion can increase motivation , improvement to perform in good manner to succed successful employees.Competition provides great opportunuties to pepole.

But in cooperative makes pepole often lazy because they think their group will complete their tasks,engaging in competition provides involving ideas to acheive important victories. 

So I strongly suggest that, COOPERATIVE COMPETITION IS MUST to attain great success.

THANK YOU...
