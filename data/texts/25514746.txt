Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others? In my opinion focusing on the happiness of others has proven to be a more effective way to give yourself happiness while also increasing the happiness of others around you. 

I have had some personal experiences with this. For example, While I was on a trip to a friends house I caught the eye of someone who was down 2$ to pay for their food and in that moment I felt the need to help them right then and there and after I decided to pay the 2 dollars I felt really happy it was like helping people made me a happier person than I was before. With this example you can see how focusing on someone else is happiness can also give you a form of happiness along with the happiness of whomst you have helped.

On the contrary there are people who believe personal gains or wealth will bring you all the happiness you need. For example, A rich man who has "made it" in life and has retired at 32 leaving him to do whatever he wants and telling people that he's happy that he can take it easy for the rest of his life because he focused on personal goals. On this specific example it shows that the scenarios can be different for many different people some may prefer to focus on their personal gains and are happy that way and some may focus on others happiness and remain happy that way. I would prefer the first example as I find happiness in helping others than personal wealth and gains.

To conclude, Many people have different ways or forms to achieve happiness one may be receiving happiness from the happiness of others and the other might be happiness from personal gains, goals, and or wealth. Personally I would be more happy giving others happiness than focusing on wealth and personal goals.
