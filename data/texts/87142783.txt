Happiness is all about small things. i felt happy whenever sunshines, rainfalls and wint breeze.little things make me happy. i felt happy about to going to  school and meet my friends  to make feel happy.after compeleting the scchool we enter the college and make them happy to in our next step of life.happiness in a positive vibe to make everything is positive vibe and happy to everyone.

Then we enter the college my professor once said if you want to be happy bee that inspires me.happiness comes on every little way.we can make everyone happy  they can also get motivationed and get confident about their situation. we cannot hurt others feel and their profession. not everyone has same phase of life . we don't know their lives and their dreams. so never hurt anybody . we have one life so live it to the fullest.

happiness means not for our own happiness fulfilling others happiness is also makes happiness.happiness is not a best quality. it is a basic quality of human being. aiming at something to focus on their achivements and others dreams to fulfill also make the happiness. to fulfilling others dreams and see the smile on others face to make happy.
wholefilling others heart gives one satisfaction.
