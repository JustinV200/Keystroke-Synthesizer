Social media has made getting your image or brand out there much easier than it used to be.  People form impressions about products or people before they actually come in contact with them.  This works great for people trying to promote a brand as a general rule in the begining because they can show off the flash first so to speak without having any real substance.  The old saying what you see is what you get is more often than not wrong.

People have always been attracted to the visual of things though, I think this was true even a hundred years ago, people put their best face forward so to make a good impression and to sell things.  Whether this is right or wrong it is the reality and human nature, we are all attracted to shiny things.

A first impression will only take you so far though, even if we are first attracted to something because of the way it looks time and exposure to the product or person will eventually show the true nature and I think that most people will then search for the  talent, character, substance within and in the long-run will see through an initial good impression and form an opinion based on other things.

We are a shallow society in  part and some people never look past the surface to see what they are actually being "sold". They make up their mind based on an initial impression and never change it.

People are actually pretty savy and won't be fooled long-term by all flash and no substance, they will stop buying the product, following the celebrity, voting for that politician, etc.  While images and impressions do have an effect I think they just draw you in they don't keep you. I think the surface is the initial attraction but in the long-run what is beneath wins.
