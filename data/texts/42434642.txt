As humans we experience life in our own two eyes. We can try our best to understand others but at the end of the day we see what we see. Some people have a very good understanding of this and make a living in making sure that we see things that are appealing to us. This is done through the use of clever advertising, bursts of colors and promises of beauty and status. The effect these images and impressions have on humans is undeniable and it is only getting worse.

The main culprit of the "over impressed" person is ourselves. We also want the best for ourselves and it is nearly impossible to not compare yourself to your peers. When we compound the effects of social media and the constant barrage of advertising we see everywhere the promblems we have our arising exponentially. Companies take advantage of this by producing more and fabricating the idea that we must consume more or be less than those around us. Everyone is caught up in this loop and it makes for a society that is more depressed and less happy than we were before advanced technology.

So how can we overcome this issue? Unfortunately we are not naive to the social medias we use daily in fact, we rely on these in our day to day lives. We have become dependent on the very thing that is killing us. What we can do is take back control on what we do see. I would advise against following entertainers and public figures. Going back to the days where we got our news front print media which is far less impressionable. Recording television shows and skipping commercials. There are many things that can be done to reduce exposure to these advertisements and manipulative images we see daily. But at the end of the day it is us who must decide to unplug. To say that enough is enough and that we are happy with what we have. We must use our very eyes that have been susceptible to the manipulation and see what is real and what matters. Whatever that may be for you.
