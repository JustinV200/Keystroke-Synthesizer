    Throughout history, people have been exisiting in an environment of both competition and cooperation. This occurs in our workplaces with our coworkders, within our families, amongst friends, and more.  People acheive more success by competition.  Competition has arguably and obviously created some of the greatest inventions, creations, innovators, and ideas.
    Cooperation on the other hand does not build creativity or individuality. Cooperation rather creates an environment of sticking to the norm and afraid to deveiate. That is why in some countries like China that work more by cooperation, we don't see a lot of entrepeneurs because of their fear of being shut down by the government.
    Some of the greatest technological achievements of the last twenty years were acheived because of our competitive open market. By competition, we have seen the rise of such entrepeneurs such as Elon Musk who invented Tesla, Steve Jobs who revolutionized apple and the iphone, Warren Buffet who created Berkshire Hathaway, Marc Zuckerberg who created Facebook,  and Jeff Bezo who brought online shopping to a whole new level. There are many many more prominent entrepeneurs, but this is just to name a few. These men and women would not have been able to create these novel ideas without fierce competition.  Instead of working with others, they decided instead to engage in revloutionizing their ideas and as a result, they really changed how we live today. We would not have Amazon or social media or the many other technologies that were created by these intelligent men and women if it weren't for their trailblazing drive to acheive it through competition with others and seeing that they have something worth fighting for.
     Competition is extremely important in creating new skills and ideas and overall acheiving important milestones. Without it, we would have the many entrepeneurs of today who have changed history as we know it.
