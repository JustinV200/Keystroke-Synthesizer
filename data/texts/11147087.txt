What you see is what you get. It's a popular saying, but is it true anymore? In this day and age, it can seem like an outdated phrase, just words strung together. Genuine, real people seem hard to find and truth seems like finding a needle in a haystack. 

It's not to say that there isn't any more genuinity or truth in the world. There are still people who value honesty and substance over a shiny gloss covering their flaws. It could be argued that it's not the fault of the people, society is to blame for making them this way. You have to be this, look like this, act like this to gain favor or you'll be forgotten, you won't matter. This is true to some extent. 

The media has certainly helped along the idea of perfecting an image. Celebrities are a prime example of this. They go through media training, to make sure that they don't sound a certain way, that they please the general audience, that they enamor them so that they will want whatever "product" they are trying to sell. But constantly doing so can be hard on them, after all, they're just people too. 

The constant social media experience makes us think that we have to constantly update people on where we are, what we're doing. What happens if we're doing nothing? We have to create a somewhat fictional presence. We want to show something of ourselves, even if it's not the sole truth. Instagram feeds are a good example. Look at the food I ate, look at the places I've gone, my life is great and fun all the time (which it can't be). 

If we can stop looking at the shiny exterior and take a moment, just a moment, to dive a little deeper, to look inside and take our time to understand, whether it be a person in the media or a product or service, I think that will help rediscover the greatness of something real, which is something beautiful.
