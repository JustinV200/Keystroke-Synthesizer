Happiness is an integral part of finding peace and calm throughout one's life, and many spend their entire life searching for happiness. It can be exhausting and depleting, searching for happiness. But where to find happiness? Is it by following one's own goals, or is it in making others happy? When focusing on personal goals, one experiences happiness moreso than if one were to focus on the happiness of others.
Without personal goals, life is meaningless. When we work towards accomplishing personal goals and actually achieve those personal goals, we experience happiness! And that is a great feeling! However, it is important that our personal goals are not too big or lofty, otherwise those goals become unattainable. If our goals are unattainable, we fall into a trap of never being able to accomplish them and thus will never experience true happiness.
This isn't to say we should neglect making others happy. There definitely is joy to be had in bringing happiness and joy to those around us. However, if we are unhappy in our own skin, how can we bring happiness to others? It's sort of like the old "airplane safety" metaphor. If the oxygen mask falls down due to loss of cabin pressure, put your mask on first, then help those around you. You can't pour from an empty cup, so to speak. Make sure that you are happy first, then focus on making others happy.
In conclusion, focusing on one's own personal goals is the best way to find happiness. If one neglects to care for their own happiness, we cannot bring happiness to those around us.
