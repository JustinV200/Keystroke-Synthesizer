Materialism is power it is simply something that everyone want to have in this world. Having material in ones' life means that they have money and are able to spend it any way they would like. There is a lot of critcism related to this manner and it does have it's benefits and negatives related to it. 

First off, Materialism should be looked at from an objective perspective of it being okay to show off what ever property that you have. There is a great chance that someone worked hard for their money. In addition to getting that money they may use it to puruchase something with a high material aspect to it and show it off to people in society as a means of being successfull. Showing off the material that the one person owns is alright since they worked for it and it is simply a byproduct of hard work. Equally a person can be in a greater position then possibly others. However, to play devils advocate this can also be seen as a bad thing in society and if anything it can be seen way worse off then even rather good. When someone likes to show off how much they have in life people can think of this person as flashy or snobby and to only care about material goods rather then using said money to help others or even do something better with it. Materialism only shows one side of the story and we won't really know much more about the person.

Overall, critizing materialism isnt't inherently a bad thing, however it really depends on how you percieve what materialism is and creating your own conclusion of it is totally up to the person. Materialism is something that has its' benefits and negatives and ultimately it all comes down to whoever is looking at the subject and how they want to think of it. It is very important for people have certain opinions of materialism because it generally can be make or break when it comes to looking at the subject as a whole.
