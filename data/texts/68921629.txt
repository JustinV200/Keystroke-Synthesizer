happiness is something that is not gained by our own personal goals but the real happiness is something that is achieved by helping others.Helping others is called as humanity which focuses on our happiness.the happiness that we get from achieving our personal goal is smaller than the happiness that we gain by helping others.

              The smile of the poors and needy is priceless.which we cannot get by achieving our own goal.giving food to the poor makes us happier than buying a new bmw car or an i phone.the main thing is looking for the happiness in other people surrounded by us.the happiness comesalongthe way of making others happy.life is very short to live.so live your life to the fullest by helpingothers.

              Happiness is not just a 10 letter word but it is something that we get through a little care for others.for our birthday we all celebrate it in a grand manner.just try by going to an orphanage and that will be the best birthday in your life.the blessings and the happiness that we get on the day will be priceless and it will be worthfull.it is so called as humanity.and every humans should have humanity in this world.so spread humanity and look for happiness in others.
