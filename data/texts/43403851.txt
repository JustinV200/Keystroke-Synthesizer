As we are growing up, we are constantly shown on tv and in various forms of media the picture perfect athlete. Strong, independent,  never waivering in their pursuit to become the very best. But, is this focus on individual glory really the best approach? Could this star athlete have achieved even more if they put just as much effort into lifting their teamates up? Is personal triumph really worth it if you are celebrating alone?

In my own personal experience, the need to prove yourself better than others has only had negative effects. The idea that we should strive to be the best of the best at all costs only promotes toxic mindsets and selfishness. Imagine where we would be as a species if we were to put just as much emphasis on striving to make our communities the bes they could possibly be. If instead of individual glories, we celebrated together, as a whole. 

When you focus all of your attention inward, everything around you is bound to fall behind and lose importanace, and this is not what we need as a species. We are community driven, we have a need to feel love and acceptance. There is also a case to be made about the individuals who cannot achieve personal greatness. This leads to seclusion, fear of failure, fear of not living up to expectations. 

We should shift the focus from competition, to cooperation. We could achieve so much more if we would work together. Forget about party lines, economic classes, genders, sexualities. We should quit trying to prove we are the best, "I" am the best, and start working towards making us the best.
