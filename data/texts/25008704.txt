I believe that in many circumstances, working cooropertively is the best was to achieve success. Competition can create negative feelings and hostility towards co-workers. Cooperation allows different processes and ideas come to the table, less stress on an individual to complete a task as well as more potential to achieve success.
 
Cooperation in the workplace is extemely important to achieve goals as well as create positive  employee relationships. Requiring your emplyees to work together as a team decreases stress on an individual as well. The goal at hand can be assed by the team and when the task at hand is completed they will feel a sense of accomplishment as a team. That is great for a company, for morale and overall workplace success. Pairing certain teams together that are diverse (race, background & education) to ensure that ideas and concepts are always creative, is very valuable.  

The downside to competion in the workplace is that it creates a feeling of hostilty and negativity towards co workers. This would make the workplace a bad environment and would cause employees stress and unease.

Overall, to create an effiecient, positive and successful workplace I believe it is critical to have a cooperative environment, rather than a competive one. The lasting effects of working together on projects and tasks is effective and benficial to workplace relationships and promotes positvity. Competition only brings hostility and negativity. Cooperation leads to success.
