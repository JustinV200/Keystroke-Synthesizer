  We live in a day and age where mankind is palced into groups of those who fit in and those who don't. Those who are viewed as being materialstic and those who supposedly aren't. Whether we want to admit it or not, we place ourselves in these groups by falling to the trends of the world. I for one think that it is inevitable to fall into one of those categories and as much as one tries to be different, even then you need to have a certain lifestyle to be "different".
  That is where materialism comes into play. Every person has their view of what it means to be materialistic. You ask a person who used to a certain lifestyle where wealth has been plentiful, they would view being materialstic as something that is more than their lifestyle while a person who grow up conservatively, would view the wealthy person's complete lifestyle as being materialistic. This all goes down to, how I believe that we are product of our environments. If you grew up wealthy, you tend to be exposed to a different lifestyle then a person who grew up with parents who could barely make ends meet. I wouldn't call a person materialistic for wanting a better lifestyle or caring about the things they can afford because society as a whole implemented these mindsets to us as children and in the environment where we grew up.
  For these reasons, many people who grew up with a certain income level will most likely stay in that bracket their whole life because it is what they are used to . You can't blame people or criticize them for their upbringing or the way they were taught. Only when one grows up and can be their own person, is when you can decide where you want to go in life. Even then, to want more in life is not being materialistic but wanting a better lifestyle for oneself and maybe even for the next generation. That is the sign of progress and embetterment.
