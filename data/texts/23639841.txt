As an avid and past competitor, it is in my blood to love competition. I love it in every aspect that it exists. However, when you really break competition down, you start to understand some fundamental aspects of competition that may or may not be healthy in regards to promoting significant, lasting accomplishments. 

I whole-heartedly believe that cooperation is one of those things that is often better than intense rivalry in promoting accomplishments. When multiple people work together to satisfy an outcome, there is growth, not only in each individual's understanding and knowledge of a subject/project, but also in their cooperation skills. Promoting cooperation as a means to success further installs the thought process that humans can and do continue to grow and learn from those around them. 

While someone who leans on the side of competition being the best route for success may drive the fact that comeptition forces people to gain more knowledge, I beg to differ. Competition creates intense drive/rush that often leads to sloppy results and rushed data processing. Someone who is gaining knowledge through these means is not holding onto those details for an extended period of time. 

Overall, while competition and cooperation may both be effective means for achieveing success, I feel that cooperation is a better route for achieving optimal results. It forces a group to work together, learn from one another, and expand their mindests beyond their own individualistic thinking processes.
