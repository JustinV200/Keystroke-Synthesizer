I don't think modern society should be crtiticized for being materialistic. It's in human nature to be attractive to material things, or anything that interest us, or we may find to be beautiful in appearance. We are visual creatures, so our eyes will always gravitate to material possions, especially shiny ones.

We are also innovators, we like inventing and creating new things and comming up with new ideas. People are gonna keep learning more and advancing as time go on so there will always be new products showing up and appearing. Most of these material possessions helps improve our lives and makes it easier, so I see them as beneficial.

Some people see value in certain material items than others, it's not the item itself that's valuable, but the value others put on it. Take NFTs for example, they're completely useless, but the reason people buy or collect them is because other people see them as valuable and they want to make a profit. That being said, I would say people are more money driven than materialistic. The only reason the materialistic items are made is too make money and most material items solves a problem wether it's making a task easier or financial.
