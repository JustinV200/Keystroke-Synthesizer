From a very young age we are conditioned to share and cooperate with others.  In our sibling relationships it is reiterated over and over to get along with each other, take turns and share our toys and even our food.  Cooperation is a survival skill in life that each human should cultivate to be sucessful not only in the business world, but in our personal lives as well.  
           
A lone wolf cannot survive successfully without the support and cooperation from the pack.  In human existence, we too must rely on others and cannot thrive all alone on an island.  Without interaction from others and their valuable input and expertise, we would be suffering before too long.  In a very primal level of food and saitiating our hunger needs, if we were all alone on an island and had to survive, it would be extremely difficult.  If you were shipwrecked with a whole boat load of survivors, it wouldn't take long for a leader to emerge.  Then each person's skill set and knowledge would be quickly made known to better the group.  By sharing their skills and experience with the whole group of people, they not only would have a better chance of survival, they could actually enjoy the experience and have a good outcome working together cooperatively.     
         
In the business world, we too must learn to work together cooperatively.  No one person can do all the jobs.  We must work together as a team to acheive sucess not only monetarily, but also emotionally.  When we work together cooperatively, the business will benefit, and also induvidually each worker benefits from the success of the business.  To survive in business and in our personal lives, cooperation is fundementally the most important skill to cultivate!
