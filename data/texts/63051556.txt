It is for sure an interesting thought process to determine if people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition.  While some may think working together to cooperate can achieve more success, others think that competition achieves more success.  One must ponder which would be the greater of the two to achieve success?

I believe that one must settle on the two options presented to us.  Is success gained through working in cooperation with others?  Or is success gained through competition?  It can be a struggle to lean towards one side or another.  It could be that both are in the running for close agreement that both would have equal and similar outcomes.  What would you choose?

I think friendly competition gains more success.  You learn to provide your best abilities to gain overall success.  You create an atmosphere where you must hear, engage and speak to learn difference and overcome obsticals.   You independently are responsible for your success and this means that you will give your overall 100% of yourself into achieving a desired outcome.

Although you may argue that cooperation may be effective at aquiring success.  It may be successful to a point.  You need to all agree in a cooperation and that isn't 100% guarenteed.  No one always agrees 100% of the time.  You are never all in with everyone else's opinions.  Unlike competition, you always know your stand.  You know your views and standpoints.  You are responsible for your outcome, not others.  In the end, it surely shows that competion brings more success than cooperation.
