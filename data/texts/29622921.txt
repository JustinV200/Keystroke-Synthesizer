 I believe both cooperatioon and competition are important to succeed but I believe people achieve more success by competition than cooperation.

  Competition will allow a person to compare and to see their strengths and weeknesses, which in time they will achieve more success. They will achieve more success because they will improve the areas they are week in, learn new and better ways to do things, and improve overall which will be helpful for them and others.

 Cooperation is important but if a person wants to achieve more success then competition is the most important. The more a person competes, the better they will become, and the more they will succeed.
