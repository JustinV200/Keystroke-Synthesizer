                         First of all I would like thank you providing the oppurtunity to express my point of view.Acording to me the real happiness lies in the happiness of our own but also at the same time that happiness lies when help others to acheive their success.  Because making some others to be sucess and happy gives us much more pleasure which cannot be explained in the words. progress on our gives us the satisfication but it gives more positivity when we help some others to acheive their goal. When we acheive this it gives us both satisfication and also positivity. 

                For an example, If I like to start up the company with the money I have  it gives me the satisfication . Because of  that I will reach the height and also I will also acheive success. But it also needs some talents st reach the height. I cannot able to achive the height without the help of others. For that instead of giving the oppurtunity  to the already suceeded people If I gave the oppurtunity for the people who is in the need and also the with the talent it helps to acheive their goal as well as the success. If we both grow together tht more happiness lies in my own happiness as well as also of their happiness.

        From this I conclude that, the real happiness and satisfication lies in our own success and also in others happiness and sucsess. So IF we had oppurtunity to help others to build their goal we have to support them in all the possible ways. Once again I would like to thank you for giving me the oppurtunity. 


Have a great time in reading and also a beautiful day ahead.
