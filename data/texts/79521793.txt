I would say that focusing on one's personal goals is more likely to lead to feelings of happiness and fulfillment than focusing on the needs and wants of others.

In my own life, working on my own personal betterment has lead to a massive overall improvement to my mood and outlook on life. I was a "people-pleaser" since childhood, because I was taught by others, who valued their well-being above mine, that it was their well-being that I should be concered about. Ultimately, this led me to feel that my own goals aren't as important, and that therefore, I wasn't as important. So focusing on myself as an adult has made a massive positive impact. Maslow lists "self fulfillment" as the highest human need after all.

People might argue, "You can't deny the joy you feel when helping someone out, or even just being kind to someone and seeing the positive reaction from it." That is true, but these people are forgetting to mention exactly who to help and why . Helping those close to you can lead to happiness in the long term if your success is tied to theirs. Helping people who don't care about you as much may contribute small amounts of joy in the moment, but living like this all the time will lead you to live out other people's dreams, not yours.

Even if it is your true goal to make everyone else happy, you can't do that if you yourself aren't happy. You must improve yourself before you can try to improve the lives of others. So metaphorically do as they tell you every time you get on an airplane, "Secure your own mask first, and then assist the child."
