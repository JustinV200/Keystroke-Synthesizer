Success is measured by how much you can achieve in a certain area in your life. There are different methods of attaining this success, either through cooperation or competition. In order to accomplish this, I believe there is a healthy balance between, both cooperation and competition,  that needs to be taken into consideration in order to be succesful in your goal.

Working together with a team, or cooperation, is important because you are able to take into consideration other people's ideas and hopefully produce a better quality outcome. Maybe someone else has a more effecient way of accomplishing a certain task, or simply a way of having a better outcome. 

However, you mustn't forget that you always want to do your best in everything that you do and with that thought comes the idea of competition. You can listen to other's ideas, but don't forget to use your own and try to improve on them. Competition shows others that you are willing to go the extra mile and work harder in order to accomplish success and lead. Being competitive does not mean you do not take consideration of anything or anyone else.

In conclusion, being able to balance competition and cooperation will bring you better success in whatever you set out to do. Working together to decrease intense rivalry creates a better atmosphere in order for you to flourish and come up with those great ideas conducive to your success and achievements.
