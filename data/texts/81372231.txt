Do people believe that success happens alone, or together? This is a question that has plagued humandkind since the dawn of history, and an interesting personal question as well. This can be answered in many different ways, depending on who you ask and their culture and beliefs, and change depending on the subject that we are overall talking about. Certainly it can be said that there are strong factors in either case, however upon closer inspection one is clearly more superior in the long-run. Looking at this issue from a long term perspective shows that like nature, humans achieve more success when we cooperate together. 

All it takes is a simple look around to appreciate the beauty of cooperation, even the laptop that I am typing on would not be possible without decades of science, innovation, and engineering. The marvels of modern life of to not only make the physical laptop, but the incredibly long chain of economics and commerce that it takes to get the laptop in my hands and connected to other people! Certainly, there are areas where competition breeds inovation, rivarly, and separates monopolies, but these are on a small scale. Things like, product differences, brand differences, or sports are all things that work well in competition, but it takes the cooperation of society to make the infrastucture to allow for healthy competition. 

We have seen what happens when there is too much unhealthy competition, which turns into conflict. There is far too much conflict in the world today, and part of the solution is to look towards ways that we as a species can cooperate, instead of compete. If you ask me, I believe that we achieve more when we work together.
