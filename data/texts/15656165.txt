When you make others happy, it will put a smile on your face! People are more likely to be happy when they look outside themselves to serve others. They can find joy, fulfullment, and a sense of purpose when they focus on something other than their own happiness.

One way that you find joy is when you help another person to accomplish their goals. When you see someone else succeed, it gives you a sense of pride and fulfillment that you won't find when you only try to please yourself. You will also find a sense of purpose when your goals are for the mutual benefit of many people instead of just yourself. Finally, you can find unexpected happiness when you sacrificially give of yourself to help someone in need. 

Some people think that the only way they can find happiness is to do whatever they want, buy whatever they want, and not care about the consequences. They believe that their own personal goals are the most important thing in their lives and won't let anything else stand in their way. But those same people end up bitter and unloved. They are miserable, unfulfilled and alone.

But this does not mean that you can not achieve your own personal goals. But it may actually be easier to achieve them by helping others. People who are kind and helpful to others are more likely to be successful in the long run than those who are "sharks" in the workplace. Promotions into management are more likely for people who help their coworkers than those who take all the credit for themselves, for example.

When you give from the heart, you will find joy, happiness and a sense of peace that you can not find anywhere else. You will find friends in unexpected places. When you open yourself up to serving others instead of focusing on your own desires, you will have greater happiness. You can have both short-term and lifelong joy.
