Images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. Because the people are blind when shopping. They need only products. So they will not consider about product quality. If they really wants the product they will go for them. 
Even youngsters also attract with appearance. They expect only appearance. In my childhood i remembered i will buy things by only their colors. Not about the quality of product. In the world everything about apperance no matter about ability. In Entertainment industry some people saw their skills. But most of them need only about their external appearance. I remembered the proverb The face is the Index of the mind. It means Face is everything. i.e., appearance said what you are. In our new technology world everything will happen if we need. There are lot of technologies are came. If we want to change our body parts its possible. No one is perfect in this world. But Everthing can be perfect done by our technology. These same concept is ruling our world. We always prefer beauty than the quality of the thing or human being. Nowadays media deliberetely exposes their need. They need only appearance not the content of the people. So images are the very much needed in this world.
