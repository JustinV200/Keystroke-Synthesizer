The subject is happiness and how we, individually,  come about it.  Happiness can be different things to different people.  Some people find their happiness in helping others, or feeling their own happiness from pleasing others.  Others are very goal oriented about their happiness, only thinking about how it will make them happy after some effort, only thinking about themselves.  

In order to see happiness ahead, you have to be a bit of an optimist.  Most pessimists are pretty grumpy because they cannot see a path to happiness, and that is sad.  We all know someone, or have met someone, who is just an unhappy person, always finding the down-side of a situation.  This is where the rebuttal comes in because people find happiness in different places and for different reasons, but it depends on that person and their personal outlook in life.  Of course, some have been dealt a hardship, like poverty, disablities or violence in their lives, and that can make it very difficult to find any happiness.

Some can find happiness in the little things in life like seeing and staring at a beautiful, lone, buttercup in a field of weeds or the look of surprise on a child's face when they see their new puppy.  I believe happiness comes with some degree of thankfulness, as well.  If you are thankful for all that you have and have been blessed with, then you can be happy and content in your heart.  By giving thanks, it creates a happiness because it forces you to find some goodness in your life. Everyone needs a little happiness in their heart, even if it comes from pleasing others.
