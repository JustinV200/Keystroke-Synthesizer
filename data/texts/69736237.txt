Materialism is a very good point for being productive in our life. But some percentage of the people are being criticized for being materialistic. I could say that they don't know the exact meaning of being materialistic and what are all the real benefits that we could enjoy in being materialistic, let me say it in few points below. 

If a person has a temptation for the first time on a product or something else inside his mind and heart it would let him to stay focused on attaining or achieving his goal to buy that product. If that first achievement gives a happiness inside him, then slowely it would build a confidence inside him. Then again he would set short term or long term goals to achieve them with confidence. Then he would work harder or smarter to achieve his remaining goals. Slowly he would become so bold enough to face the world with courage. 

In my point of view being materialistic would make a person so determined and help him to build his self confidence and courage to face this entire corporate world. It would help him to be focused on his possessions. I would say that this mordern world is moving in a right path and there is no need of worring for being criticized. Now its your time to think and take action according to your intuition.
