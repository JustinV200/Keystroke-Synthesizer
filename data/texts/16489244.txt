   In my point of view, success is achieved by cooperation. Because, when a person takes a work individually, he could not complete it within a time or it would take a lot of time and hardwork. But if that person cooperates with other people he can make the work more easier and faster as well. There will be an effective result in the cooperative work.
   Cooperation is something that people work together and acheive a common goal. When a company or a businesss needs a best result, The employees need to work together. So that they can achieve a lot quickly and effectively. Competition is something that single person runs for his goal restlessly and gets tired and wastes a lot of time.
    Team cooperation in any organisation is more effective and overall work will be at its best. Coopearation has a best example, which is a sports team. In a team there will be many players. When single player tries to make a goal, it is impossible in a game. When all the players goes together,Then the team wins. So the conclusion of this topic is, Cooperation is the key to success in any form of work or business, games or any field.
