What makes you happy? Humans derive happiness from a variety of sources whether it be achieving personal goals, basking in the happiness of others, or simply enjoying the smaller things in life. However, this makes one question whether there is a method to happiness that evokes stronger emotion. Focusing on personal goals and achieving them is said to lead people to great happiness; however, deriving happiness through the success and happiness of others may bring about stronger feelings of fulfillness.
Anecdotally, I have found myself to feel more fulfilled and content when achieving personal goals compared to focusing on the happiness of others. As someone who takes great pride in succeeding in life, the initial planning, journey and execution, and completion of one's goal is a feeling that cannot be matched by focusing on others. For example, when playing a video game, most players feel greater satisfaction when completing a mission themselves or defeating a boss on their own. However, watching a Twitch streamer complete the same tasks will not bring about the same feelings of happiness as completing it on your own.
Although the majority of people will find more happiness in pursuing their personal goals, one can still find a great deal of happiness through others. For instance, I often find those that volunteer for those less fortunate to be happy individuals. This is likely due to the nature of bringing others up and the feelings of fulfillment one gets from that. As a result, the amount of happiness one gets from different activities lies on a spectrum rather than a two-dimensional scale.
Therefore, focusing on succeeding with your own personal goals will lead to you more happiness than focusing on the happiness of others. Thus, if one is seeking maximum happiness, they should pursuing their own, personal goals. However, this is not to say that you won't find happiness through others around you.
