Happiness can have many different meanings and reasons behind it. Happiness depends on the person himself.  Each individual is unique and therefore view happiness in many ways. What makes one happy may not be the same to others. I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others because what good is it if you are happy while everyone else around you are not.

Personally, I am happy when the people who matter to me are happy. My smile is wider  if the people I love are smiling. Most of all, happiness for me is the joy of being the reason why others are happy. It makes me feel good knowing that I was one of the reasons for positivity. 

I have dreams and personal goals too which I try to achieve. Acheiving them makes me feel happy and proud. But my family and friends who are the nearest in my circle are part of those dreams. They are the people closest to me.  

On a wider scale, happiness, peace and unity is what I hope for for the entire universe.  I hope to see a brighter world where every person cares for each other.
