Modern society should absolutely be criticized for being materialistic. We have now found ourselves trapped inside a hamster wheel of sorts, always chasing the next "buck" to quench our neverending thirst for more. In America especially, bigger is better, we're always hungering for more money to meet our "need" for things. At the same time, current cost of living is unable to support this type of selfish, immoral behavior. It's quite frankly disgusting.

In light of the hell we've all lived through in recent years due to the pandemic, you'd think people would take the opportunity to pause, reflect, and perhaps realign their priorities in life. "Regular" people are suffering daily at this point in time. Rather than chasing something that can't be attained, people should focus on things like their family or what brings them joy (aside from material posessions, of course).

Alas, our government and society continue to peddle this gross farce that you simply can't be happy without having it all, even or most especially if you can't possibly afford it. We have all been knocked down several pegs in recent years and yet we still find ourselves willingly putting ourselves into tremendous debt because we're told (and believe) that we "need" whatever the current "it" product is. What a horribly sad way to live. Where are our priorities?
