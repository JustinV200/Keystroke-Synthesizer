      People are more likely to be happy, if they focus on their own goals. If you focus on the happines of others, you could be sacrificing your own happiness. The reason why I say this is because, you can't please everyone. No mater what you do, someone will always argue with you and debate you. 

       Now with that being said, it doesnt mean you should annoy people. You need to be happy in life otherwise you will come across things like depression. You need to find a balance between compromising and not. If you go into the world with the "all or nothing" mindset, you wont make it far. The reasoning behind this is if you only do things your way, people will get upset and will move on. 

        If you focus on only other peoples happiness, you will end up with depression. People will always tell you how good of a person you are, and how you're making a real difference. But at the end of the day you will have some happiness, just not enough. For example, if you dedicate your life to lets say making the world a better place. There will be people out there that will cheer you on because they are getting what they want. I would consider that them taking advantadge of you, and playing with your emotions. Another example is, if someone makes you feel like crap when your trying to do good. The reason why I say this is because, all you do is try to make things better. But you can not please everyone and for that reason, you will not find happiness along the way, if you just please everyone else. 

       In life, you need to find the balance between your happiness, and the happiness of others. Sometiems in life, it is better to be "alone." What I mean by this, is you can learn alot of valuable lessons when your alone with yourself. You can focus on your dreams without other people trying to discurage you. That is why, I personally think people are more likely to be happy if they focus on thier goals.
