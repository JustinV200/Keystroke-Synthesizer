I think it is correct. our modern society be criticized for being materialistic. Because at the present time we are all run to bit everyone. our social culture every day grow up so we are also grow up. if we are not grow our selves then we are stay at the bottom of the people.

at that time if we will survive in this world then we have to grow up our self thats why we are spend of our energy in producing and consuming more and more stuff. I think is not wrong because if leave freely and happly life then we have to do all things whatever.

every day science grow up, every day industry grow up, every day production grow up, so if we belive that we are surviving our present as like past time that vital source of meaning and happiness then it is not possible at that time. I think both are important for our life one is happiness and other side our materilistic.

life is form of philosopical which carry the main fundamental substance in the nature and other all things  that include our status , love everthing. i think we should maintain our status for our leaving also make so much love for our family ,friend etc.

If we hate this thing that materialism but we cant avoid this. so partly i am agree with the statement but some how in my mind its also true in our life. at that time we are spend more money for bring the lots of love ,happiness etc.

so we accept our modern society for being materialistic and being a part of this materialistic socity.
