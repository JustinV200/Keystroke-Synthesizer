          Happiness is not only achieving our goal it also includes humanity.  Let me tell you one example, one day there were  two girls named Joy and Feena, who were working hard to become an IAS. Both of them were a good friends from childhood. 
           Both Joy and Feena were studying for IAS exam for past 3 years. Eventhough both had an experience about the exam, they could not able to pass in the exam. The date of examination had announced, both decided to work hard to pass in the exam. They started to study day and night. Day passess and the exams were getting closer, both had a fear about the exam because this is their last chance. 
          Finally, the exam arrived. Both of them had written their exams. Once they cmpleted the exam, they discussed about the experience of their own. Joy told that "she did her exams well" and Feena told that "her performance in the exam was good but not better". Both of them were waiting for a result and the results came. Unfortunately, Feena passed in the exam and Joy had failed. Eventhough Joy failed, she was very very happy that Feena passed in the exam.
