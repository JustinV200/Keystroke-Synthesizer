Success is something everyone wishes to achieve. There are different ways success can be achieved. The way each person achieves success depends largely on the personality of the individual involved. Another factor is the motivation.

Success can be achieved by both cooperation and competition. Sometimes, the best way to achieve success sometimes depends on the end goal. For example, a soccer team can achieve success largely by cooperation while in other fields like Marketing sector, success can be achieved through individuals competing to achieve a set target.

Personally, I believe success can be achieved more by cooperation. When everyone works towards same goal, it brings about a pool of individual creatives coming together and doing wonders. The role of diversity in accomplishing success can never be overemphasized. When people come together to achieve a common goal, there are lot of bright talents and ideas that come together at that point. This does not happen in competitions, instead the ideas work individually and as a result there might not be improvement that would have made the idea wholesome and more functional.

Others might argue that competition brings about more success due to the high need to deliever on an individual level. In as much as I agree with this, I still believe that bringing together the individual skills, talents, and ideas to achieve a common goal, brings about a bigger scale of success.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that success by cooperation is unrivaled and largely undefeated.
