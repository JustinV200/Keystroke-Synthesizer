  Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?  
  
  Yes, my belief is modern society should be critized for being materialistic. Everything nowadays is fast paced and your worth depends on how much you have. Fifty years ago people were so much happier and had very little. When I was a child my family had very little. My father worked and my mother stayed home to take care of my siblings and myself. We were happy, we didn't know that we had less than anyone else. Nowadays, with social media children realize that they have less and are treated diferrently because of it. Our society basis everything on wealth and how much you have, whether you could afford it or not.
  
  I believe one of the main reasons some people are in the finacial distress that they're in, is because they're trying to keep up with everyone else and going into debt because of it. Everyone is living above thier means. If everyone would live below their means, they may have less, but I believe in the long run they would be happier. They wouldn't have the stress that comes with debt and ultimately may also live a healthier lifestyle. Stress takes a toll on your health and debt is one major reason of stress. 
  
  So, I do believe that our society is a extremely materialistic society, and unfortunately I don't see that changing anytime soon.
