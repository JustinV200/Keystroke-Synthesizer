  Happiness is mistakenly imposed on people and not perceived as an aspect of life. Other emotions also contribute majorly. However this emotions are required in a person's life to give an equillibrium to life.
   A healthy and confortable life requires happiness although one does not need to be happy at all times. People are more likely to be happy when they focus on their personal goals other than the happiess of others. Each and every individual has or rather is facing personal issues that cause them to behave differently towards those they interact with. Emotions have recently overcrowded each and every person's view of life hence bringing about depression, anxiety, behaviors such as being bipolar and many more.
  Therefore, when a person puts a higher percentage of their focus on personal goals such as improving on diet, leading a healthy life, ensuring one meets the daily set goals, maintaining good relationship with those they interact with, ensures one is at peace with themself. Happiness has to come from within as a person can not depend on family or friends or other external factors. Depending on others to creat a happy environment can be disappointing and risky as each and every person has his or her one life to lead and many responsibilities ahead of them.
 Therefore i stronly belive each and every individual is responsible for their own happiness.
