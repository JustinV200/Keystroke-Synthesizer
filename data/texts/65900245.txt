Just imagine you work for a large company and you need to finish this project successfully. You think about and see two options on how to accomplish this: gather your team and work together or offer an incentive for the best idea which will ultimately create a competitive work environment.
There are certainly pros and cons for both options. Competition has shown to bring out tremendous amounts of creativity and a variety of ideas. Think about your science project at school. Or the latest fashion shows were designer present their newest creations. Or think about art projects where artists give examples of their imagination. Certainly, competition has been proven advantagous in arts and music field. But that might be different in areas where expert skills are required. Sometimes you have no other choice than to cooperate because your project requires the input of experts from very differnt areas. Think about the construction of a dam project. Knowledge of engineers, physicists, builder, and environmental experts are required to build a dam.
 And then there are areas were either team work or competition will work. The business project you are currently working on might be such a case. Competition might produce some good ideas here as well but you ultimately risk failure if none of the ideas are sound. Competition also leads to stressful work environments. Your worker will eventually burn out because everybody will try to be better than the others. What speaks for cooperation? Every ideas that your team produces will be thoroughly evaluated, weaknesses and strenghts will be pointed out. Good ideas will be developed further and weak plans abandoned. Together as a team you will have the chance to come up with the best possible business plan. By cooperation your team can be so much more effective. Cooperation will also build trust within your team and an environment of shared knowledge.
Overall, many aspects speak in favor for cooperation.
