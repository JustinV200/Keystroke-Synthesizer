      Cooperation yields more productivity than competition.  Each person lends their own set of skills and talents to a team when they all cooperate with each other to complete a task.  When you have a cohesive group that combines all the separate talents and skills of the group, the group forms one complete entity.   The tasks are efficiently completed and the group achieves their goals as a team.  

     Here is an example of a team of people cooperating at work.   A hospital unit has had several workers call off.  The team that's left consists of two nurses and one nursing assistant.  At the beginning of the shift, the group meets and assess the skills and special talents of each member of the team.   They work together using those skills and provide complete care for the patients.   One nurse has teaching skills, the other is a better listener,  the nursing assistant speaks a foreign language and can translate.  Total compassionate care is provided by the end of the shift, all tasks have been completed and all patients have received quality care.

      There are many people who would say that people are motivated more by competition.  Sometimes it seems that working on your own and trying to surpass the performance of others in your group will achieve more.   Frustration can arise when one person feels that working with others can be a burden and slow them down.  While there is merit to competition, my opinion is that it is usually for want of the spotlight or attention solely on them.  

Teamwork yields the best results.   Members of a group adding their own special talents and skills create one complete productive entity that can more thoroughly achieve their goals.
