If you were to ask the majority of people what makes them the happiness in life they will give you the answer they think you want to hear vs their actual personal truth. We are taught as kids to first think about others and their feelings. So this is exactly how they would answer this question.
However, what we need to teach kids its ok to think about your own happiness as well. So, when we are adults we can not only want others to be happy, but we will also understand we need to do what makes you happy as well. People will come and go, but you will always be there.
I think most people when they are honest with themselves will admit that working toward a personal goal gives them purpose in life. And the closer they get to this goal the happier they become. Most people need to feel they are working toward a purpose in life to feel happy and fullfiled. 
We need to do away with the thought that making ourselves happy is a bad thing. You can help others, but not at the expense of losing our life goals and happiness down the road. This will ensure you don't lose track of who you are and that your just as important as others. We all deserve happiness and the only person that is responible is yourself.
