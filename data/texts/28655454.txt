Modern society should definitely be critized for being materialistic. It's very infuriating that society puts a monetary label on everything. The main important thing that people should be more concerned with how they are treating one another, the Earth and themselves. There is too much emphasis on how much a person has and not how the person treats others.

When you die, you won't be able to bring any material objects you might have to the afterlife. There's nothing that says you need to hold onto your belongings in this life and not help those who are in need. Yes, the satisfaction of being able to buy items is there but there is something more to this life. Than to just produce all these materials and continue to consume them.

To be materialistic is like some sort of I'm better than you because I have all these things and you do not. Happiness should come from within. Not from objects. Like spending time with those you love. Not wither and waste your life away working so you can get more material objects. I believe that then once people focus more on the nonmaterial items in their life, they can achieve true happiness. 

You do not need to always be surrounded by material items. Just take a walk through nature and listen to the sounds. Not only you'd achieve happiness, you'll also achieve peace. We need to stop focusing on the material aspect of life and focus more on the foundations of friendship, family and humanity.
