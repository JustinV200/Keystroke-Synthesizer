Materialism in modern times isnt as bad as people make it seem to be.  If you think about it the world runs on materialism.  Without people consuming products a nations econmy could not be strong.  The flow of money generates taxes, it provides jobs, and it gives people incentive to strive to be as skillful as they can be in order to get better jobs to be able to more easily afford things.  Materialism also can give us purpose.
Of course there is also a down side to materialism.  It can take the place of ideals, and high morals.  For instance when the Russian Ukranian war first started and a lot of nations decided to impose trade sanctions on Russia i heard someone say.  "Our civilization has become so materialistic that we think taking things away from someone is a reasonable punishment for an aggressive war".  At the time I just though ti sounded pretty cool, but the more I thought of it the more I became to udnerstand it's deeper meaning.  We do value "things" so much that we think life without them is a punishment so severe that it is an answer to war.  Materialism can also lead to things like greed, greed to have things, and envy, jealousy of other people's things.
All that is true, but the fact remains that in the world we live today materialism is the grease that makes the cogs turn so to speak, and with no materialism at all the world's economies would collapse and awful things would follow, things like famine and shortages of all kinds.  Even with it's undesirable aspect at this point in history materialism is a neccesity and provides more good in our lives then bad.
