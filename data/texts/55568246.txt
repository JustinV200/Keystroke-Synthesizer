Is this Insta-worthy? That's a common question among young women in our current times. What are these feeds but well curated moments in the users' lives? It is a dangerous and misleading practice because human psychology uses these images to form a reality that is simply an illusion. 

Tween and teenage girls are hugely impacted by this constant barrage of picture perfect moments, not only on social media, but also in advertising, magazines, movies and tv shows. From this emerges disastrous issues with self-esteem, obsession with weight, eating disorders, anxiety, depression. Along with this, the use of filters to glam-up the user's appearance is common place. Often when posting less than perfect images and videos, users will apologize for their hair, their lack of make-up, their clothes, etc. The expectation of how girls and women should look is based on something so far from reality, it's absolutely unsustainable. Something has to change.

Some argue that social media filters and curated moments are simply ways to present one's best self. Perhaps a way to take the pressure off of being perfect without all the image effects. That's true to a degree, but when that's all that can be seen in images everywhere women look, it distorts reality to the point that no woman feels good enough. 

It would be refreshing to see more images of real girls and women represented on social media, unfiltered, no make-up. But with a culture so focused on initial images and impressions, it's unlikely to change anytime soon. So society's vulnerable tweens and teens continue to have an epidemic of low self-esteem and all that comes along with that. In short, our Insta-worthy culture based on curated perfect moments has shaped this distorted "reality" and holds far too much power over girls and young women.
