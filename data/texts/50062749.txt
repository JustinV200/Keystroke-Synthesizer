I belive materilism is fine in some areas. The places where it is fine is when you need ie food, water , shelter, things that help keep you and your family alive and helps you need in your day to day, you can't even live without morter veliacils like cars or mortercyles. What if you need to see someone in annother contery or state you would need a plane so you can go there or if you have a bussness or bussness parter or anyone really you need to get them. Even on smaller levels like games and movies keep us interain and we need to disract us from or lives some times. where it hurts us is the impact on the enviroment the more we consume and make the more garbage get made. And all the things being produse consume more and more energy and that puts more polushon in the enviroment. And even the food we eat produses trash with rappers or bottles or cans. It can also consume us as peaple we only think about the metrial thing and not the peaple in our lives or our morals. What we can do to fix our problus is use more eco fraindly mateirals and not get complet consumed by our ambishons. It's up to us to help our planet and we have the responabliaty to try our best to do so. It is ture that we destory a lot with materialism so we need to turn around and help our planet togeather. We need to all work to together to help our planet or we won't be on it anymore.  So all our petty difrenses need to be put asied and we need to work as one to builed the furter we need for us, our famils, and, our home. That's the best thing we can do at this point we already did so much damage allredy no need to do any more on top of that. we should be critcied for our actions.
