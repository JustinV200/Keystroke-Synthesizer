                    Objects are only part of human life , But we are giving more importance to materials than humans. Materials  are only useful to make humans life simple and easy, But they can't give love and care for us as they were only objects. For development and modernization of our humans society we need materials. They only use ful to upgrade our lives.
                     We definetly need a person to share our pain, feelings, love and care. Materials can't do that so materialism is not wrong but being too much materialistic may lead to dangerous consiquences. As materials my become dangerous if we depend too much on them. As we can't depend on machines or robots our daily activities. Criticizing materialism is wrong but, being too much materilistic is also wrong. Cause we have machines are made for use of human and humans are there to help and support each other.
                     For modernization we need machines to upgrade , We have to remember that machines are just to be used by us, But in the future machines  may make us as slaves, If we provide them more knowledge than they need. So modern society shouldn't criticized for being materialistic , but should be limited to use them in a proper way.
