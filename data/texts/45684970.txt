Happiness comes by pursuing their dreams and their own personal goals is true when we reach our longtime goal or our ambition is reached we get pleasure and happiness but we get more then that by making other people happy and improve our humanity.

In my point of view full happiness is keeping our surrounding happy without any vengeance, it's really a wholesome feel when we made our surrounding happy. May somebody hurt you in past but you need not to take revenge of them instead of taking revenge forgive them and make them happy by your smile. We need to love everbody to live a fulfilled life without any bad thoughts, We need not to make other people hate us by hurting them. In the same way achieving our goals and dreams also give us happiness but it gives happiness only to us and not to others but it is also very much necessary to reach our goals but it do not gives permanent happiness it gives temporary happiness but by humanity we get pleasure and permanent happiness.

Humanity is to help others, seeing everyone as kind without hate or thought to hurt them. Helping animals which is in trouble gives a specific happiness which can't defined in words, Helping other peoples gives you a Higher image in society and makes you feel happy. The one word which differetiate animals and humans are humanity. We are humans only because of being kind and showing humanity to others we must help others we they need our help.

So by these In my point of view helping others and focus on others happiness gives us real happiness and showing humanity and aiming at something other than our own happiness makes us to find our happiness along tha way easily. So focus on your surrounding happiness and make yourself happy.
