      In my point view I always says that " Happiness is the key to success".  Many people have their happiness only while acheiving their own goal rather than focusing on happiness of others. But for me the real success and happiness will come to us only when we acheive our personal goals while helping others. 
  
     Let me explain you with a simple example if a personal wants to start an event management as his/her company it was their ultimate goal in their life. They have enough money to start the business but at the same time they want to give the oppturnity  to the young talents so that they have their oppurtunity to give happiness to the needed people. So that they can acheive success and also they can give happiness to some people who can need help to  acheive the goals.

       In this it is clear most of the people were find their happiness by helping others at the same by clearly acheiving their goal. So that also gives them the inner peace and also motivates them to acheive more success and help so many people to acheive more success.
Anyway being happy will the ultimate goal of the life. Be happy and gave a great life.
  
Thank you for the oppturnity to express my thoughts. Have a great day
