I believe it's important for people to set their own goals. It's important for one's own happiness to look forward to something. To have a goal in life and to strive for it.

Being disabled it's difficult for me to exist on a very basic level. Everything comes hard to me and because of my weakness, everything takes me ten times as long to do as normal people. So for me, it's very important to keep a focused goal in mind somewhere in the future, if only possible in ten years, or even not possible at all... it gives you something to look forward to and to keep striving for. To keep oneself focused and to keep depression and anxiety stifled down deep. Because if one starts spending too much time inside one's own head (mind) then it's natural to develop depression. Being disabled, it's not a leap, to be depressed, being unable to go places you want to go or be as independent as one would like to be. 

Being focused for several years on a goal of getting my own independent living situation, away from my parents' house without acccesibility, really gave me something to look forward to and to strive towards. That is very importan to keep one sane and in good mental health.
