People are more likely to be happy if they focus on achieving things that will make them happy. By that I mean that it's more effective for someone to realize what they value to be happy - romance, friendships, careers, material possessions, etc. - than blindly wishing to be happy without having any concrete steps to take. So it doesn't matter whether someone focuses on himself or others, as long as that is part of what will make that person happy. 

Everyone wants to be happy, whatever their version of happiness is. But the same things don't make everyone happy. That's why it's important to know/figure out what will make YOU happy so you can work toward it. Otherwise, it's fruitless to just hope for happiness and expect things to go any better than not thinking about this overarching goal. For instance, sitting around at home day in and day out hoping for happiness probably won't accomplish anything, unless sitting at home is the only thing you need to be happy (though you probably wouldn't be hoping for happiness if you already had it). Sometimes, great things happen when you aren't trying, like if a delivery man mistakenly comes to your door and then you fall in love. But most of the time, things won't come your way unless you do *something* to put yourself in a position that makes them more likely. 

Knowing what will make you happy will also help you evaluate your happiness level when you achieve things you want. You can see if you're actually as happy as you thought you would be, or if you need to adjust your goals. 

In any event, it doesn't really matter whether you focus on yourself or others in your happiness pursuits, as long as whatever you focus on is something you think would contribute to your happiness.
