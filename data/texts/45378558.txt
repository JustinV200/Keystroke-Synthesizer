    The history of human civilization is a story of duality. From the beginning of recorded history, our societies have been fraught with conflict; however, there has almost always been growth. What drives the advancement of our collective civilization? Some argue that competition is the catalyst for success. Others would argue that cooperation leads to prosperity. 
    Cooperation is the key to human success, on both an individual and societal level. Throughout history, cooperation has led to the greatest feats of human accomplishment. We do our best when we work together, and our mutual efforts enrich us all. Some people may argue, however, that conflict is also necessary for acheivement. It may be true that healthy competition can motivate people to work harder and aim higher, but too much of a good thing can lead to a breakdown of social order and foster resentment. Inevitably, too much competition devolves into conflict and strife. 
    Ultimately, it is clear that cooperation enables people to achieve more in life. Could human beings have landed on the moon or built the pyramids if we didn't work together? Competition has its place in human life, but it is secondary to cooperation. When human beings band together, we realize our full potential to acheive success.
