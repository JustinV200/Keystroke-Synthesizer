                                                            HAPPINESS
                   Happiness is like the key to all doors. A person is happy when he/she acheives something in his life. People are running behind a goal and when they acheive it takes their happiness level to a total new height. A person can make others happy only when his goal is accomplished and in a position to make others happy. 
                    Happiness emerges from the childhood. A child is pursuing his/her dream right from the start of the life. Each and every milestone is like a personal goal and when they acheive it they become happy and move on to accomplish another goal. The goal keeps coming and the level of happiness gets more and more when people strive hard to acheive it. 
                    A personal goal when acheived makes a person happy and in turn he/she makes others happy. Let us imagine without acheiving anything just making other happy makes any sense. It does not even lead to anything. So I guess only when a person is fulfilled from his/her standpoint and attain maximum happiness will make other attain the same. A personal goal can be anything related to employment or it can be towards pampering themselves. No matter what, happiness attainted through personal goals means a lot and it takes the person to a whole new level. I do understand happiness is gained by serving others and making them happy however the base point is to serve others we need to be happy as well. 
                   Thus to conclude I would say that once a person fulfills his/hers personal goals can go ahead and make others happy.
