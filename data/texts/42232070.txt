People are more likely to be happy when they adjust their mindset and focus on the wellbeing of others.  It is easy to focus on the things that go wrong in life but changing the way we approach life to notice all of the good things is where happiness will come in.  
Friends and family are a very important part of each of our lives.  Without them we would not be able to find happiness.  Forming those relationships and focusing on how other people think and feel are especially important.  Small acts of kindness go a long way to making others happy whether it be a word of encouragement or a small gift.  
Even helping strangers can cause us more happiness than focusing on ourselves.  That could be a smile, reaching out, monetary assitance or many other things.  This gives us a good feeling and knowing that we contributed to the community around us.  Making the world a better place produces more happiness than just getting what we want.
Kids are a great way to shift focus from ourselves to the hapiness of another human.  It is both the most difficult thing to do and the most rewarding to take care of a child and make sure they are happy and healthy. It causes ultimate happiness.
Many people think that achieving goals they set for themselves will cause ultimate happiness.  This typically includes monetary goals or achievements and, while nice, will ultimately leave them wanting more.  It is when we view the world around us as a place where we can do some good that we will actually achieve the hapiness that we are searching for.
