should modern society be criticized for being materialistic you ask? Well do you honestly think every person that is considered wealthy with plenty of cash to spend on anything they would want is truely happy? Therefore im going to give you three good reasons for why materialism should be criticized.
 first off materialism distorts the meaning of material. i say it distorts it because it exsists for making ur lives a little better and easier by meeting our basic needs to help improve ourselfs. My grandparents are always saying how when they were young they never had all these things kids have now days compared to when they were younger. Yet they sill believe life was happier and more simple then today. Still though people now days sacrifice everything, including there health to earn money for this material stuff! How crazy and stupid is that!ended.
second if material things did bring people so much happiness then why is there so many of the wealthy people on this planet devoted to given there wealth to charity! such as bill gates and michael jackson.
lastly acquiring possessions, spending money on material objects just deprives us of our senses to love and care for one anoher. Families break apart, friends grow apart , even couples and marriages ending. All these beautiful things lost all ending in fights of material things but is it really worth it?
I guess what im saying is materialism in the end only misleads people the wrong way from pursuing happiness n fullfillment making them unaware of all the wonderful things just having connections with people and nature brings!
