Yes, modern socitey should be criticzed for being materialstic. We live in a world now days that eceryone just cares about money. People are so lazy and don't want to work, they just want to get paid, be lazy, and waste money on material crap. They become greedy and very shelfish. People today are to focused on getting more and more things and not caring about anything else.

Is social media a problem? Yes! Social media make you think that you need some of the coolest things, the biggest things and the most expensive items. This young generation today only cares about themselves and getting the coolest things to make them look like the cool kid which is complete crap.
People these days are worried about getting the most procy clothes, the latest iphone, or the most updated car. 

What happened to talking a walk outside, reading a book or just straight up spending time with family and friends and hanging out. People shouldn't be judging others for not being able to afford materialstic things. Not everyone should feel down about themselves about tonight being  able to afford certain things. So yes, modern socitey should be very criticized for being so materalistic. After all, they are the reason why todays generation are so self centered. 

I hope one day, things will be better, people will bcome nicer, and the wrold will be a much more simpler place again. Lets all stop worrying about who has what, and lets be grateful for what we do have in todays world with inflamation prices rising and todays enconmy. 

Some great words to live by: Be grateful, be kind, and be humble! Help those in need instead of making fun of those who don't have or cant afford materalstic things. People today just want the money money and nothing rlse, and they dont care about anything else.
