Are youtube video posts (video advertisements) a correct reflection on what the video truly is? A hobby of mine is "How to make money online." I watch an abundance on Youtube videos on different ways to make money online. What I mean for an example is if the title of the video is "Best Survey Sites to make money." And in the video it'll have 5 different survey sites and you would think these are the best ones to use. But because the youtube "Influencer" as they're called uses sites they're paid for advertising it affects the way they present their video. Instead of presenting actual sites that are worth  your time and ones where you make the most money you're presented with ones that are paying the youtube video maker with ones they get the most money for telling people about.
How do you know which people to listen to? How do you know what survey sites to go to and spend your time on?It's a mass group of videos that you dont know  which ones are legit and which ones are not. 
I wish youtube wasn't run by advertisements and which advertisers are paying which youtubers. How does someone like me know which ones to listen to and which ones to ignore? Do I go by the ones that have less subscribers or more? I would guess the less subscribers? Or maybe not because those youtubers are trying to get paid too right? So is all of youtube run by which companies have the most money? It's hard to know and I would like to know how to tell which youtubers to listen to and which ones not to? In my eyes there's no way to know is there? I can Google and read articles but now I'm googling I'm youtubing all to find out how to make the most out of surveys sites?
