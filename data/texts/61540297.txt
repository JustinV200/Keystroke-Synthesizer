I personally believe that hapiness comes from pursuing your own goals.  Happiness as an emotion something that comes and goes but when you are on the path to your higher purpose and becoming your best self you are connecting spiritually to a happy state.

Even if you face setbacks in life the knowledge that you are always becoming a better version of yourself is something that you can always take relief in and in that sense is another form of happiness. Conversely the knowledge that you could be better would always leave you with a sense of dissatisfaction.

Some would argue that focusing on yourself is egotistical and does not  bring about happiness but i would argue that pursuing your goals does not have to come from a place of ego and can just be thought of as your spiritual duty to become the best version of yourself you can possibly be. Even if you believed that happiness come form improving the lives of others, it would be a lot easier to help more people if you yourself was more influential, wealthy and disciplined.

In that sense the greatest way to achieve true happiness in life is to continue to work towards becoming the best version of yourself you can possibly be.
