People are very complex and have an innate desire to succeed. Although some people do thrive through competitive atmospheres, people achieve more success by cooperation than competition. This is due to the creativity brought by multiple minds at work, by the confidence given by collaboration, and more people being passionate about a project. 

When multiple people are working together they have the ability to implement ideas from other's and get other perspectives other than their own. When people are only subject to create from what they know, they limit themselves. Working together with the implementation of many people's ideas allows for greater creativity and insight to be brought to the project. Cooperation can bring about such greater success because bringing people's ideas together makes for a more complex solution. 

In addition, collaboration brings about confidence. When multiple people are working on something, there is a greater chance of people taking risks. People are not as afraid of failure when they are not the sole dependent of a project's outcome. Therefore, the chance of significant products being created are more likely to come from cooperation because people will take risks that lead to breakthrough. 

Passion is a final piece leading to lasting accomplishments. Multiple people coming together with a common goal gives way to passion moving a project forward. When several people want something to succeed initially than the project will tend to continue to have impact and be worked on going foward. It will not just be a one-hit wonder and than fade away but people will continue to evaluate and make improvements on the project going forward. 

Therefore, success can be brought about by competition however by using cooperation, the successes will be more complex solutions, greater breakthroughs, and continue to make an impact in the future.
