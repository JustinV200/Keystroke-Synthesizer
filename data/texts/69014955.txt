Social Media takes up alot of time for people in our society today. There's Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. On these platforms, there is a large abundance of advertisements of influencers that can be seen. These influencers are seen as these people with lives that are perfect. I think these influencers can have an effect on their followers; and I would say it has too much of an effect.

There are many reasons why images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. One of these is the manipulation that can happen from influencers. Some followers can grow to have some aspiration to be like their favorite influencer. So, influencers might advertise something they don't even believe in; and as a result, followers are swindled into buying a lackluster product. Another reason is related to mental health. This reasoning coincides with the idea that followers aspire to live the same lives of these influencers. They desire to have these perfect things that they see from these influencers. This leads to a decline in mental health due to them constantly comparing themselves to these perfect influencers; which is only a false image that is shown on social media. They will never be able to live up to perfect lives because nobody has a perfect life. Therefore, their mental will constantly go in a downward spiral.

As you can see, images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. These images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. This being from the manipulation that influencers can impose to the destruction of mental health that can happen. I know many people that attempt to compare themselves to influencers that they see on social media. This can be about their body, car, home, clothes, etc; and if you try comparing to something that is only for show as perfect, you will always lose.
