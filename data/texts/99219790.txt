Whether or not modern society should be criticized for being materialistic should be answered by looking at the world around of us. Does it feel good to have nice things? Yes. Does it speak to your status if you have nice things? To some. However, what really matters and speaks the most is the kind of person you are, not what you have. Many people around the world do not have the bare essentials needed to survive. Therefore, by overconsuming and being materialistic one should be critcized. Instead of buying things we don't need, we can donate and improve the life of others in impoverished countries. 

If American people were to really look at what they need to to live versus what they actually have, most if not all would find they live with material goods in abundance. By taking the money that is spent on consumption of unneeded material goods and donating it to people in our own country or countries who are continually suffering- we can make the world a better place. This kindness and generosity speaks more volume than any designer purse or expensive car. Many would argue that this is a ridiculous notion however because they worked hard to obtain the money they choose to spend on material goods. While that is understandable, there is a fine line between enjoying your money and wasting it on things that do not matter in the grand scheme of life.

In conclusion, materialiasm in modern society absolutely can and should be criticized. We do not need an abundance of material goods to live a fulfilling life. What we need to do instead- is be the best people we can be and watch out for those around us who are less fortunate.
