In todays world, we see ads and pictures of celebrities in the way of how the world perceives images to be. This is affecting us as individuals and creating a false images of who we should be and how we should look. The thing is though, impressions and images do not detemine who we are. Instead this is affecting our generation on how they should look, how they should feel and giving them a false sense of identity.

Impressions and images only give people that sense of false identity without truly understanding the individual and what they are feeling emotionally and what they have personally achieved. This can be seen through stories today of people committing suicide at a higher rate  than normal due to not "Fitting in" because of these images and impressions that have left marks on our society of what normal should be. Children and teens are now having break downs due to this and this has been causing mental health issues to also be on the rise due to how they should look or act due to the affect of what is acceptable from these images and impressions that are shown through social media, news, magazines and the list could go on. 

At the end of it all, we can be confused on what our impressions or image should be. Images and impressions should does not define us as individuals and it does not show how our behavior or others behaviors truly are and what they are capable of. We have let this thought of images and impressions affect us for far too long and have not looked at the ability of the individuals which has hindered us as a society. For us to advance pass this superficial looks, we just need to communicate to understand one another and this will allow us to learn, enjoy, and truly accept others behaviors and charactertistics and will allow us to feel as if we belong in the world we are currently in.
