             Happiness is a state of living in which you can enjoy everything you see and admire the beauty in every situation. Happiness comes from the work you do which you like. It is nothing but comfort where you can be strees-free.
               Everything in the world need hardwork and pain. So, we can't find happiness through the work. Enjoyment like going to movies, having parties, spending money can only give you happiness for a short time. The real happiness is in our heart. the more peace we have the more happy we will be. No money can buy you peace. But, a person's gratitude for your help, a person's smile can you bring you happiness that would be more valuable than money. 
              People will be more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others insted of their personl goals. Personal goals only give proud feeling , that's not the real happiness. We may be a superior in office or at our work place. but , we are just a normal person for the world. A person with humanity will be a superior for the entire world. 
               You don't have to spend money for showing kindness to other people, just a small smile when you see them can change their mood. Helping everyone can also helps you one day. Live with humanity make others happy and be yourself happy.
