Where does happiness really come from? This is a question that has been asked over and over again.  Some think that happiness can only come from an external source or event. Others believe that happiness can only truly come from within.  We all know that happiness is what we all wish to have in our lives. I believe that happiness can come from many different sources and that there are different levels or intensities of happiness. Let's take a look.

Happiness I believe can be obtained by helping others with ther goals AND also helping themselved with personal goals.  I do think that there can be more satisfaction or, true happiness when you help others acheive their goals. When you see someone succeed after you have shown them something it is truly a gift that you cannot imagine.  Like teaching a child to read and hearing them read their first book out loud or, helping someone pay for groceries that would not have been able to feed their family that week.  Some say that happiness can only be obtained when you personally succeed rather than help others. I  feel like this might provide a temporary satisfaction but, not long-term. 

You will never run out of people to help, to make smile but, you can run out of things to do for yourself to provide happiness.  I think that more people should help others obtain their goals rather than be selfish and only think of themselves. I belive we would all find true happiness as a society if we focused on eachother.
