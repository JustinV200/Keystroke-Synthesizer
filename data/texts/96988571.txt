People are more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals, rather than the happiness of others. I believe accomplishing personal goals leads to a greater satsifcation and more fulflillment in life. Helping others is very satsifying but often people take it to the extreme which results in self neglect and burnout. If people rather look inward and focus on themselves they will lead a more happy life. 

I have personal experience with this when I was working in the healthcare field. I was so focused on helping others and helping humanity. This resulted in a lot of unhealthy behaviors and the decline of my mental state. I would not take my breaks. I would work extra hours. I would also bend over backwards to help my coworkers. I did all of this at my own expense. I became very burnout and depressed. I even sought out treatment and was on medication for anxiety and depression. I was not taking proper care of my hygiene or eating proper meals. As a result, my mental state suffured and I had a nervous breakdown. I feel like if I was more focused on my own self and my goals this would not have happened. I do not have any statistics to back my personal ancedote up, but I feel like this is very common in the medical field. 

Now I do not work in healthcare anymore and I do not focus as much on other people's happiness. I have various personal goals that I am working on, which makes me feel so much better mentally. For example, I am focused on exercising, learning coding, and saving money for traveling. I do not have to take medication anymore and I regularly take care of myself. I feel so much more balanced in life working on myself instead of focusing on others happiness. This is why I believe that people need to focus on themselves and their personal goals in order to achieve happiness and fulfilment in life.
