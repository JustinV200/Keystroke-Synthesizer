Rivalary and the competitve nature of humans allowed to invent and evolve themselves as individuals. This competitve nature has put individuals behind of themselves as they will be fighting an internal battle with one another instead of what they could have accomplished if they were to work with each other. I believe that the consequences of cooperation will provide better results than competing against one another. 

Cooperation allows the formation to create mutual benefits and alliances that outweigh competiting each other. For instance, if one village is adept at growing corn as their crop and lack the skills in raising cattle, and the other village is effective at raising cattle but they are inept as raising corn , they would be better off trading each other products then raising their own. These villages can form an agreement that will mutually benefit one another. However, if there was a competitve nature among these villages of who can raise the best cattle or the best corn, they would lack the skill to do both. Cooperation will yield better results for these two villages as they will be acquiring the products effectively. 

In the end, cooperation will engender stronger results versus competiting against one another as this competitive nature can hinder the performance and abilities of an individual. If two parties participate in a an agreement to trade skills or products, they will make up where they lack the skills to be proficient in.
