Today I will give you my own opinion on how I see how many people are criticized on there life, or criticized for not having the ability to spend like others. So they are judged and criticized by the others cause of the way we have had our cards dealt to us.  I think that people with the ability to spend  so much money on material things do in excess ways. As to us that can't afford the luxury to get the fancy new sports car or brand new clothes, or house. It can be very diffucult and heatbreaking due to not being able to do for our families like others can.  And I feel that us that do not have or just can't afford things like that value and respect like for what it is. And there is times that the wealthy people look down on us or laugh at us cause we don't have what they have. Or just being talked bout cause we are just  to poor. I never or will not ever take life for granted. I we value life so much more then someone that has it all. Money is the greed of all evil and it destorys family ,friends and loved ones relationships. I don't wish or have any hate or wish anything negative to any of the wealthy people or do i wish them any harm. It's just reality that some of us are born into that luxury to have it all and some of us are not able to have it all like others. And thats ok too. I feel and see things from both perspectives and love my life, and me personally don't or do I take life for granted. I also that GOD every day and count my blessings even if it's not much but I'm alive and well and thats all thats matters to me. But I'm ok with that
