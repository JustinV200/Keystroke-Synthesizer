In the given topic "Do images and impresions have too much of an effect on people?" I strongly say yes. Because now a days most people's are attracted towards many advertisements and favourable images on newspapers, social media, tv advertisements, etc.,.It will create too much effect on people's mind. Everyday we came across more than 100's of images. It somehow create impression on people. Good or bad  what they see will create a strong image on their mind. 
Now a days, mostly children's are addicted to this. Because most of the advertisements are based on children.They are easily attracted to the colourful appearances. In one way of thinking, YES, images have too much effect on people. Because sometimes people's are easily attracted to other's images.In media everything they apppear is more important.We should be aware of what we see is not real.
In social media single image creates so much effect on people's mind. In one point of view its good because a  good image create good effect on people. A single good impression of a person will create a good vibe.In the reality people's  are easily attracted to what they see. It is one of the advantages for some companies to sell their products by colorful advertisemnts.
In general Human brain is a mixture of various emotions. It will defenitely create effect on images and impressions.
