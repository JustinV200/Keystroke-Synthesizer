    Where does happiness come from in life? It can come from many things, but I believe that  it is more likely to occur when focusing on your own goals in life. 
    In my experiences, i have found that if a person focuses more on helping people, they tend to sacrifice their well being to do so. While this can be a very rewarding life goal for many, for most it tends to drain their energy to the point that they ignore their own needs to stretch themselves thin helping others. For example, i personally witnessed this when my spouse offered their help so often to their friends and coworkers that they became more and more exhausted and depressed. When i eventually forced them to stop focusing on other people and instead focus on themselves, their health and overal happiness improved. 
    Now, alot of people will argue that helping others is the most selfess thing in life, and this is the true path to happiness, but i dont think that this is a viable long-term plan. When you focus so much on others and ignore your own goals, you tend to be likely to have underlying issues that need resolved. Being able to focus on your personal goals allows for personal wellness and growth.
    Having a goal in life is the best way to forge a better life for yourself. By constructing a goal and following it, you can have an attainable target to hit. This target is a good way to keep your mind focused. This doesnt mean you will always be happy, as life has its ups and downs, but this is a deffered reward that will be very fulfilling in the end.
    In conclusion, focus on your own goals. Figure out what you want in life and go for it. Help people when you can, but do not sacrifice your goals or wellness in doing so, and you will live a happy and well-fulfilled life.
