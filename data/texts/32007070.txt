There's an argument that intense competition is a driver of success, but while that may be true on an individual level in isolated cases, in fact it's cooperative behavior that leads to sustained success.

Sports is the most obvious example.  No team sport success can be considered a product of individual competitiveness, but are instead focusing that competitiveness along with a team sharing the same goals and drive.  American football has individual superstars and highly competitive individuals, but every play, from kickoff to field goal is a product of team cooperative behavior, both on offense and defense.

Even sports that seem individualized and maximized for individual competitiveness, like tennis, benefit from cooperation above fierce competitiveness.  How often do you see a tennis champion thank their team - their coaches, families, etc.?  Without their cooperation, and in fact the individual players' cooperation, the champion would not be in the winning position in which they find themselves.

Fierce individual competitiveness has also often been casually linked to a fear of failure, but I'd argue that these are also completely different.  Being in terror for your job, for example, doesn't breed competitiveness, but brings toxic and unproductive stress.  

In any social, professional, or sporting situation, competitiveness does not bring sustained success, but cooperation does.  Rome, as they say, wasn't built in a day, but neither was it built by a single person.  Even something as simple as a morning commute doesn't bring sustained success by competitive driving; it's cooperation on the road that leads to ongoing success in achieving your morning commute.

Note: Around the 12-minute mark, I ran out of things to say and stopped typing.  I had my argument and examples, and felt no need to add words.
