Images and impressions often have too much of an effect on people. Modern society is a vapid rendering of humankind.

When children aspire to be Influencers rather than choosing a life's purpose that leaves a meaningful legacy, we are truly doomed as a society. This is how all great empires have fallen. Obsessvie ego driven existences are the demise of the soul. Social media reinforces the notion that image is everything and Mark Zuckerberg is to blame.

When the Kardashians are revered as goddesses, pro athletes and rappers are millionaires and teachers are being paid a pittance, is it time to re-evaluate how we determine self-worth?
Plastic surgeons are crafting faces to look like Instagram filters and young women are dying as a result of botched procedures. Is this level of vanity worth it?

Can we connect with our true selves again? Are we at the tipping point of collective conciousness? 
Our choices and actions in the next decade will determine the fate of the human species. We can choose compassion, activism for equality and love or continue down the path of conspicuos consumerism.

The planet will endure despite our abuse and squandering of resources. The only real threat is to humankind itself. But as Eckart Tolle has stated "all structures are unstable" and humans are not immune to creating their own demise.
