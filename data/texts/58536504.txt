I think people are truly happier when the are focused on the happiness of others. People are happy when they are focused on the hapiness of others. When you are thinking about others happiness and their need your happiness seems to be more easily attainable.

People are happier focusing on other people, their needs and desires. Helping someone reach their goals makes yours seem more attainable. You may realize the way to reach yourgoals iif you focus on helping someone else reach their goals.

Peoples happiness is relative by seeing how little can make someone happy you may realize that you are alreay happy. By seeing someone elses life circumstances youmay realize your life is so much better that you think it is.

You may realize that your life is better and life can be way more better. Life is sometimes only what you make of it. Life can be awesome and sometimes you life can be affected by your perspectives. 

People are sometimes myopic and sometimes life and the obstacles we face every day get us down and we get stuck in our own heads and we focus on our own problems and we sometimes do not know how to get out of own ways. I believe that helping others is truly the best way to help others.

The best way to find hapiness for yourself is to help others find happiness. The path to happiness is often found outsides of ourselves.  I believe that hapiness is found outside of 
ourself.
