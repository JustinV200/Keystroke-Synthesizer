What brings people happiness? I believe one's happiness comes with fufilling their personal goals and wants throughout their life. What we want in life, is what an indiviual feels will make them happy. I am going to tell you why I believe that happiness is achieved when a person pursues their own personal goals and wants.

Most litte girls dream of having a family when they are little. They dream of the house they'll live in with the white picket fence and manucred garden. They come up with number of children they plan to have with their partner. And, when these girls grow up, a lot of them still want to fufill the dream of the house with the white picket fence, the perfect partner and the three kids (two girls, one boy). Those girls now women date to find the perfect partner, a partner that shares those same goals of the "perfect family" that they dreamt about when they were young. After finding the perfect partner and starting a family, that women and man is fufilled and have happiness from achieving a personal want.
Imagine, if it was reversed and it was a woman who had dreamed of that perfect family and the man didn't have those same goals and wants. If that couple unexpectanly got pregnate, the woman would more than likely be happy but the man wouldn't. The man didn't want any children, even if it made the woman happy, it doesn't make the man happy.

I believe people get happiness by pursuing their dreams and their own personal goals. Goals that are not of your own, will not fufill you as a person. You can be happy for other people but you will not get happiness from others fufuilling their goals.
