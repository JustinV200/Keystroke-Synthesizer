            this is an excellent questions, The natural tendency for human being is to choose competition over cooperation.This inclination is further strengthened and reinforced by the popularity of Darwinism which advocate the survival of the fittest and the theory of natural selection

               Even there are many who argue for the important and necessity of cooperations but in the analysis they arte just viewcooperations as a means to a gain a competitive edge. in other words their ulimate goalis to be competive.

                 But for me and any people who dont see life as a zero sum game, cooperation takes precedence over competions life is more of a journey then a race.every one is gifted in some way to be able to live a mfulfilling and abundant life. thats the fundamental convictions  that i hold dear and clear that being said, i dont means competitions is bad. unhealthy its commonplace that people resort to all possible means whether it is immoral or illegal, to be no.1 therefore , "the key is that we should always bear in mind that compettions should be conducted in a fair" and clean manner, with the purpose to being out the best and full potential of each and every member of our society.
