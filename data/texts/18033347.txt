There are many ways to look at happiness and how it can be achieved by each person.  Some may say it is obtained by achieving personal goals and doing thing for themselves but others may see themselves achieving happiness when they make a difference in another persons life or helping others achieve their dreams.  Is there really any wrong answer to this question?

I would say that happiness is unique to the individual and in my case when I see others being happy, that is where I find the most joy within myself.  When you make a difference in someones life and get to see first hand when they accomplish something the satisfaction is extremely rewarding.  More rewarding in my opininon then when I do something or accomplish something for myself.

Picture the joy on someones face when they achieve something or receive a gift... the feeling is infectious and can warm the heart.  Seeing a child smile or obtain a new milestone in life can make even the most unhappy person glow.  I think there is something to be said about sitting back and taking in a moment of happiness from a distance to make you really appreciate what is happening and how it makes somebody feel inside.

On the contrary there are people who will argue that happiness within yourself is the best feeling of all.  When you finally do something you have been attempting for a long time or talk to someone you like the feeling you can get is intense.  The feeling of accomplishment or joy is one of the best things you can have in life.  It could be hard to argue with people that see things in this light, I mean who doesn't like to have good things happen to them in life?  

In conclusion to be happy, no matter how you obtain it is one of the greatest feelings.  Nobody wants to be sad and angry so find a purpose or cause that gives you the most joy and make it happen.  There is no wrong answer in how to be most happy in life, we all need our own way to feel the happiest we can be.
