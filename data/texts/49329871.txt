What could possibly make a person happier, accomplishing their own personal goals, or helping other people with their troubles? Some feel like it is either one or the other, although most happiness tends to come from helping others. The real questions is, are people at their happiest by putting someone's needs above their own?

In order to better yourself, you must first give something to someone else. weather it's through a charitable donation, volunteering or a random act of kindness, there are many ways to humble yourself through acts of kindness. The way we treat others is a reflection on how view and treat ourselves. A sense of self-respect could be accomplished by helping other people, and it's quite humbling as well. 

Although, too much focus on the needs of others could cause harm to yourself, especially if your own needs are neglected. There is nothing selfish about focusing on your own goals, sacrificing them for other's can be self destructive. You could become burned out, and your need to help others can diminish entirely. You could become trapped caring for someone who does not return the favor, which may have an impact on your self-worth.

There needs to be a balance, between helping others and your own needs. It's possible to find happiness both ways, after all, the people you care about rely on how much care you put into yourself. Better yourself as a person, and help guide others along the way, this is the path to true happiness.
