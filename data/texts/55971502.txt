Competition results in more accomplishments because of the greed of man. Companies all over the world compete for the top spot in different industries. Almost everything in life comes down to money. Money is the modern day motivation to compete with eachother. Competition has resulted in many different innovations, such as the Bugatti Veyron. The Buggati Veyron is a near 300 mile supercar created as a result of competing with other manufacturers to be the best. This drive results in people trying new ideas for the top spot.
 Cooperation can be great because there are many heads working on the same task. This can be great for maintaining infrastructure that has already been created. However, competition outweighs these benefits because of the constant pressure of being the best. For example, when people hold monopolies over an industry, it is usually bad for consumer. A company can charge whatever they please for a service.
 When these companies are challenged by new players it forces better products to come out. Tesla, an electric car company, would be the monoply if we all just cooperated on one goal. Since other manufacturers like toyota, are working on their own electric vehicles, we will most likely have cheaper options to choose from. Competition continues to make the world great with long lasting accomplishments.
