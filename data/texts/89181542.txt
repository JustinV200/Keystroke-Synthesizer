               In life both cooperation and competition plays a major role for the success, each acts in a specific manner to boost the people to make them more active than before and makes more productivity and thus they achieve success.
                I would definitely say that competition makes people succeed in their life more than cooperation. Because cooperation reduces the limit of the person's capability, but in the case of competition it increases the capability of a person by pushing him beyond the limit. A person would be more eager and self disciplined when he felt competitive and achieve more than the other person in life. For example my neighbour's son was very low at the marks at the beginning so my neighbour gave his son a offer that if he scores more than all the students you will get whatever you asks. By the next exam he just scored first mark in his class and buys his favorite skateboard. By this i learnt competition improves a person's capability.
                Thus i conclude that competition makes people succeed in their life more than cooperation. It improves a person's self discipline, capability and makes to work harder even more to attain their goal than their previous effort.
