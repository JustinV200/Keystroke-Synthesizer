Do we really have too much stuff, does it really make us happy? 

In a nutshell, yes, we do have too much stuff and no, it really doesn't make us happy. Why do we need  more than one tv in a home when there is only one person living there? Why are our closests filled to the brim with clothes we probably have not worn or worn once.  We fill our homes with things we think we need because a commercial tells us we need it in our lives. Materialism rules the world and we will continue to spend on useless unwanted items because we don't want to be the person that doesn't have the latest greatest item. 

Since the world is ruled by credit cards, we will always buy, buy, buy. We don't want to be without. We will spend money on things we think we need because this is the American way of life. Consumerism is the great American way to go and its twin is materialism.  We will go in debt to make sure we have things that we believe will make out lives better.

Why do so many people believe materialism or having more things is good for society? Some believe it helps the economy because we spend on more products which puts money back into the economy. However, it may help the economy, but does it help us the consumer? I would say no, it does not. We have more things, but less money, a great credit score, but more debit. Having more possessions, the latest and greatest does not make you happy, it just makes you broke and wanting more. For that reason alone, the modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because it makes people as a society week and dependent on things.
