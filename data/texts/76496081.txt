
People achieve more success by cooperation than by competition. Competition is an individual achievement that allows for individual pride and mastery. Competition reinforces a tenet that an individual is responsible for their own successes and accomplishments. In the way that competition is a process of comparing one individual or group against another, competition is inherently divisive. Because competition is devisive by nature, it does not support strengthening our social systems which would benefit all people. Cooperation strengthens our social systems and has a greater potential for long-lasting positive results.

A late, great politician out of Minnesota, Paul Wellstone once said, "we all do better when we all do better". He said this in an effort to remind people that our strength together to create better circumstances for all will result in a higher standard of living for all. Cooperation in terms of strengthing our society can be witnessed in the way our government works or doesn't work. When they work as a unit, bills are passed, progress is made. When they do not work as a unit, nothing gets done. 

Cooperation, or people coming together as one unit has the potential to be more impactful than what can be achieved by one entity competing against another. Individual achievement is important and part of a healthy society (i.e., the Olympics), but individual achievement doesn't have the potential to create the kind of lasting impact that you would have with cooperation.
