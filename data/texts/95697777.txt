             There are two kind of peoples in the world. one is being happy when they achieve their own goal,another kind of people is being happy when others achieve their goal.but i like first category people.when we have clear focused goal in  life we try so hard to achieve that goal,after so attempts failures one day we achieve that goal that day we feel very happy because only we know how hard we tried to achieve that place.
              We also happy for others success but the real happiness and success is only when we get success in life.when we focus on our goal we have so many plans to execute, we learn many things from it.we handle failures.we develope our skills.we put so many efforts for it.when in other case when other people get success we can only be happy for them,but their is no our own efforts,mistakes,learnings etc
              We should fix a goal,then focus on it.our focus should be very clear.we may fail in first time but dont giveup,try so many times.our efforts will give result one day.when we get that result we cherish it.we deserve that happiness in life.that happiness and success came by us it is completely our own.we may cherish it for life time.so in my point of view people are more happy when they focus on their goal only.
