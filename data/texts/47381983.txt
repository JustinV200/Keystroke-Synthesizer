Growing up in america we are constantly faced with lavish displays of weatlth. You cant turn on the TV or even listen to that radio without hearing about the latest and greatest material thing. This sents a precedent that he who earns the most has the most fun due to the things they can buy with their wealth. I dont think this modern materialism is unhealthy nor do i believe it should be criticized because it can help us set goals for our lives. 

When we have goals rarely are they to make things worse. This means that if you are someone who values materials you will be motivated to work hard to get them. Some might say this is greed but considering life is so arbituary we shouldnt judge someone because their goals and aspiratiosn dont align with out. Look in a hospital parking lot and i assure you that you can easily distinguish the doctors cars from the nurses. The physicians all drive nice cars and potentially picked that career path so they could attain that luxury vehical. People and society ingeneral being materialists can lead them to be of great service to their community.

Considering the pursuit of materialism can often lead to people working hard it would be counterproductive to criticise modern society for being to materialistic. In fact i believe we should support materialism as it can be a benchmark for people to strive for. There is no set way of being and materials can be a concrete way to root one to this earth and help establish our goals in life.
