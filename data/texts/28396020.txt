Images and impressions have such a huge effect on people. From the packaging to our favorite brands, to the celebrites we all follow, it all has a major effect on how people act, speak, and dress among other things. We see all kinds of different colors and pictures that change how we feel and thing. 

The colors on the pagkages you see in the store have an effect on your mood. Packaging colors are chosen very carefully. The bright colors were chosen to get your attention, causing you to look at their product. They can also cause your mood to increase. 

People look to celebrites so much that just any one of them could sway someone with just their opinion.  All the celebrity endorsements are so affective, because the general public is easily swayed by the celebrity that is behind the product. The general public count not like the product, but because their favorite celebrity is endorsing it, they will go out and purchures it just because of that. 

In conclusion, our moods are greatly effected buy the images and impressions around us. Unless we as people stop letting these outside forces effect us as much, it will continue to happen. Theres nothing wrong with any of this happening, sometimes its a good thing that it messes with our mood. We jsut have to be more aware of what these things are doing to us.
