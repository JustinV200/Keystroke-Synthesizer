There is no doubt that people achieve more success by cooperation. Working as a team can lead us to so many places and oppertunities. It opens more doors to succees. It can be difficult at time and we might feel like we do not need anyone but in reality, we can do a much better work working together. This is something that needs to be addressed in today's world. We often compete with eachother when we can do a much greater job as a team. We are all great, unique and no one is better than the other. The idea of competition is also interpreted as who is better than the other, which is wrong. 

There is a saying that two heads think better than one. There is a reason for that. What one might not think of the other might. A team can come up with all sorts of brilliant ideas. Also, there are things that we can not do by ourselves and we need the help of others to get to our goals. For example, when new to a job, we need the help of co-works when we are comfronted by a challange. We we encounter a problem, we reach others to solve it together. 

We we use competition instead of coopeation, we just fill ourselves with anger, fusturation, and ugly feelings. We often do things wrong or try to find the shortcuts to cheat and be the first or fastest one. We gain enemies and are often cheated on too. We can get lost in our way and end up needing the help of others and end up feeling guitly about it. It can be complex and challanging to have a competitive work place. Working with others can help us reach other people, achive better goals, become a teamplayer, build long lasting friendships, and think better because two heads think better than one. 

Cooperation is the idea and best way to achieve success in this complex world.
