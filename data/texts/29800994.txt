Everything we see these days both online and in other media is engineered to manipulate the viewer. It may be to purchase a product, vote for a candidate, or to even get a medical procedure. A grain of salt is no longer enough, everything must be double checked, and heaven forbid you back up an arguement with sources that are not sanctioned by the parties engaged in the manipulation. 

It's actually a coordinated effort. The news anchor states a false or manipulative position in full agreement with the advertisements played when he says "we have to pay the bills now".  They don't actually say that, it's more like "time for these important messages from our sponsors". This is also in full agreement with politicians statements, and straying from this will get the anchor removed. 

I do not recieve any TV programming, but I occasionally am subjected to this content when in hotels or visiting. The amount of pharaceutical advertisements is astounding. Maybe I notice more since it's only occasionally, but I would have expected to at least see Flo from Progressive mixed in with all the excema medecine. I heard the TV say that "vaccines only work if everyone gets them", which is most certainly not how vaccines work. I get ads in email from Zillow which do not accurately represent the property, but I need to click to find that out. If a mobile home is in a park they hide this, you need to use google maps satelite to find this out. Then there's the "virtue signalling" compainies that tell you how environmentally friendly they are to get you to buy their overpriced coffee. But that's ok, there';s a veteran owned coffee company too.
