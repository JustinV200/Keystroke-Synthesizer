Images and  impressions have too much of an effect on people. In this world of Facebook, Tik Tok, Instagram, social media and reality television, a person's image or 'advertising' is way more important to other people than their character. We have have very little attention spans as humans because of media and nowadays we have to convey so little infomation in such a dynamic way to even get noticed or be considered and be able to get our foot in the door.

In olden times, it wasn't like this. As humans we could interact and have geniuine connections and conversations with complete strangers and that was how the world worked back then. But things have completely changed. Technology has advanced faster than the human spirit can keep up. We are losing sight of our humanity and our fellow human beings that we share the earth with. We need go back to being better listeners. Better human beings. Better strangers. Better brother and sisters to one another. Better fathers and better mothers. If we can look within ourselves it's not too late to go back to where we started and course correct where we are headed. Ultimately, technology is made by people. A tool. We can never lose sight of that.

It is now possible to become the people we all strive to be, but we have to limit our reliance on technology and stop judging everyone on superficial sound bytes, algorithms and marketing and really look at each other as individuals. The most important things are our dedication to the human connection, what is inside our hearts and the love and devotion we have to other fellow travellers on this planet we share with one another. I believe we can look beyond impressions and look past images and see the real within.
