Everybody wants more money and more stuff. But the question is if having more money and more stuff will truly make us happy. The saying is that it is easier to be happy with money than without it. It is my opoinion that if you have enough money to live without worrying where your next meal is coming from or where you will live next month, then you have enough stuff to make you happy. If you are healthy, you really do have everything.
I am sure some people feel they need a new car or a luxury vacation to be happy. They might feel that if they can't buy anything they want at the moment they want it, they can not be happy.

You don't need money to snuggle a grandbaby or reminisce with at old friend. It doesn't cost much to sit around a campfire or walk on the beach. Just sitting in the yard or on the front beach with someone you love can bring happiness.  Sharing a memory or a laugh can bring contentment to your life.

It can make life easier but it won't make life happier. Modern society should not be criticized for being too materialistic. It is embedded in our culture. It takes time to get past all of that.
