Trial by fire. A culture of competition. These are the concepts that many of us are raised on from an early age. We are given images as children of success amounting to bettering our enemies or winning above all else. As children this may be okay and result in positives such as exercise and decision making. However, into adulthood cooperation will result in greater amounts of success, even though the school yard game of King of the Hill can still be found among our peers and workplaces.

In youth there is an inherent culture of competition as children seek out boundaries with themselves and their peers. Oftentimes children are too unruly to maintain a team centered approach, and even if they are on a team, individual achievement most important. However, as we mature, our lives mostly become team-based, be it with our spouses, offices, partners, etc... The hormoned approach of no guts no glory erodes away with the need to identify mutual understand or shared goals in order to succeed or to meet our personal goals.

While there are certain careers that thrive on competition (sales). These types of careers are also changing and more cooperation among peers results in greater returns for the firm. As sales firms grow or as clients grow a single sales person cannot maintain the detail necessary for expanded services. Also, a culture of competition results in only the best for people who thrive in those situations, leaving other members of a team as untapped resources.

There are benefits to competition within a team for some individuals to achieve, but the competition should not outshine the benefits of a cooperative atmosphere. Cutting out a portion of your team is a disservice to their talents, but also results in a business that is lopsided on talent and one that will definitely tip in the wrong weather.
