There are two ways for success to be achieved, the one is through cooperation and the another one is through competition. Cooperation is needed in group level achievements only, but if you need an individual achievement, you will have to compete with others to achieve the success and you don't need to cooperate with any other people as you're the only person trying to achieve it by competeting with the another person.


If there is no competition, there is no value for your success as there won't be anyone to show your negative points. You will see only the positive side of yours if there is no competition. Competition helps you to improve yourself from your past mistakes. You will see yourself through the mirror and question yourself about your progress and it will help you to find the way to improve your thoughts and progress. So, you will always increase your chances of achieving success after each and every try.


In my opinion, competition is the key to achieve more success than cooperation. It will help people to put their best efforts to achieve their goal which is called as success. It will help them to improve positive energy and it will also improve their respece in others point of view.
