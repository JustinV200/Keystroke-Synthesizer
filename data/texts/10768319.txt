Would you like to be sucessful? It could be argued that people achieve more by cooperation. I disagree. I think it's all about competition. There's a lot to be said about both arguments but I am going to demonstrate how the difference effects everyone, myself included. There's every reason to cooperate, but do you achieve as much when comparing yourself to your peers? 
When people cooperate, some people may not pull their entire weight. There's no guruantee that anything will get done. There's nothing saying that all must participate equally. That's what this is about. Equal. When competeing, you know you are the one in charge. The one whose pulling all the weight. A down side to not cooperating with someone is the drawback of having to work all by yourself. But you know that there's no one out there trying to make it so you can't succeed. It's you against the world. There's no reason you can't achieve more success. 
The drawback to competiton is the mindset of constantly comparing yourself to other people. If you don't succeed, there's a big chace you're going to busy yourself comparing what you do to anyone who you see as better than you. You also can't blame other people for your lack of work ethic or interest in the competition. There's nothing saying that by cooperation you're going to achieve it all. Nor is there when you work alone in a competition. You are your own worst enemy. And that is what's wrong with competeing alone. 
In conclusion, competing is the better avenue simply because you are your own worst enemy. If you succeed, then it's great. Cooperating with other people means that you are relying on other people to make sure you succeed which could lead to great failure. In my opinion, competeing is the better avenue for success. Your own mind is what stops you. No one else.
