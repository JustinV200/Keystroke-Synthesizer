What is image and impression? It basically a persona you create once you meet or interact with someone. Once you look at someone you create your own notion about this particular person. A conclusion of who and what the person is has been created in your mind. But as we all know that our image what we truly protray is not what we truly are.

We as humans are easily manipulated by image and impression of others when we first meet someone. We are often impressed by the material things in life, how someone has dressed, how well they have groomed themselves,what car they drive, where they live and who they associate themselves. By seeing all these we create an impression that this person is wealthy. In another case if we see a person who is not well groomed,has unkept hair and drives a not so expensive car we judge them for not having money or being poor. We forget that there is something more important someones behavior,their actions, their values and what they stand for. We give so much power to image than what is truly important.

In media we admire people because of the image they have created. Politicians,and celebrities create a certain omage so they can control how we see them. I have done the same thing over and over in my life so as to protray that my life is perfect by smiling infront of people by dressing a certain way so people would think I have money and yet people truly think that I have it all together yet I dont. I am deep in debt and I have loans to pay. But by creating this image I want people to like me.

Look harder and deeper into peoples character than their image. Cause image is not everything.
