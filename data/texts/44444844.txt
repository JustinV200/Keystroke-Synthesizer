Appearance of people seems to be most welcomed by many now a days. Because people started judging others by their looks at first sight. This is so unfair. People should not be treated in that way. All humans are beautiful in their own way. People need to realize the true fact that not eternal beauty pays them well. People appreciate your beauty but they wont stay with you if your heart is not pure enough.

Impression and images are something that is not going to stick with you for a long time. When time pass by, all those things will start fade away. And judging one with their images has much effect in this world today. But this should get changed by people. Not anyone having the right to judge anyone. Hence, we don't need to keep ourself with a mask called impressions. 

People keep on trying to perceive things by holding their images. Some believe their first impression will play a vital role in their life with others. They started making decisions about the persons they meet at first time itself. So, in todays world, many people are very good at pretending themselves of being good with their looks. This makes others very difficult to find their own color. 

Hence, people need not to be very concerned about their looks at all. All they do is to have a good heart to help others, to trust poeple, to respect elders and to be successful by living their life very happy. Finally, what we see is not much important than what they can. This is how people can change their way of seeing others and giving value to what it actually means. 

Impression is neccessary but not mandatory. We can be good even without exaggerating ourself to people.
