                                          People achieve more success by competition.
                                     Anybody on our opposite gives more motivation for us to complete our work faster. For everyone compeition is the one to encourage us  to move forward on their lives. I am also having an enemy to competite in my job to the growth in my job carrier.
                                      For example, in a school competition between childrens is done to motivate them and bring out their talent to know who they are and what they are having them? A running competition or whatever sports is having between the childrens to complete between them who ever knows who is the best one?
                                      Our enemy is the one who knows what is beyond us. To gain victory in your life a motivation, competiton must be there to encourage us, to fight us to know who we are? Definitely a sucessfull man must have an enemy for their growth.
                                        A successful man also faces a failure with somebody else in this world. All must be failed with their competitors in different condition in a different situations. It is definitely happen. One who learns more in his failure. A competition makes one to move fast, think smart, run faster, make them to think wiser, an encourager, a motivator. 
                                        Cooperation never make a man to grow large in their life. Definitely competition makes to grow us.
