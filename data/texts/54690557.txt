I think advertisment is an important role of our life ideas and information about all products that reason we can choose different products but some of the advertisment might be more attractive. people are easily getting attracted by advertisnment and like to buy them but people did not the advertisnment are not worth while to buy the product that being advertised in the many platforms like social media. people think the when a product is advertised it is very special and it will be the best for use. some people have seen think different and they aware of the product advertised is not always good they know the problems


In social media like content creators are look so attractive we may think they always look like that but it is not true. in reality they have different back stories we might think physical apperance is important in social media but it is not always true.


In social media many people showing their ability and shine. so physical apperance is not always important. so we need to understand showing our ability and consistency will lead to sucess. it will take time to became famous.


Judgements of persons tend to be more positive if the first word used to describe them was positive than if it was negative
