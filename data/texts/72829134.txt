Marketing can be a very persuasive tool for companies. It can also be deceptive. Clever car insurance commercials grab the attention of viewers, while giving little information about the coverage or the price of that coverage. The worst example of deceptive advertising is when celebrities were recently hawking crypto investments. Many people who did what the celebrities recommended lost all their money. 
As far as advertisements for beauty products go, beautiful models are used for these ads. The assumption is that paying for these beauty products will make female consumers look beautiful and young. This is usually false. The FDA does not require proof that these beauty products work. 
TV ads for personal injury attorneys can often be deceptive. In my local market, one attorney has constant commercials on the air featuring clients that he supposedly got millions for. These clients were probably paid to appear on the air for the attorney and it is not mentioned that the attorney took a big chunk of the settlement money.
In drug stores and grocery stores, colorful packaging of products often catch the eyes of consumers and cause they to buy products on impulse. This is the purpose of marketing. Clever advertisements often cause consumers to throw away their money on products they do not need. Marketing is profitable for companies, and the more clever and eye-catching, the better. Much money is wasted by low-income consumers due to clever advertising.
