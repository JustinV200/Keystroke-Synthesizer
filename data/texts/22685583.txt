Happiness is an unspeakable feeling.It is available to anyone.happiness comes in a lot of ways, happiness is caused by others,caused by us too.I'm been having a lot of fun with friends during the school season.i keep making others happy too.We are happy when we are compensated for our favorite activity.I get so much fun when i dance.We are all happy when i spend time with my families.We are very happy when our goals are fulfilled as we rise gradually in life. As a family we are very happy when we see its every action when the baby is born, we are happy when the baby first walks, talks and pranks.Happiness appears in our minds when we meet someone who is for us in life.We are very happy to see the help that others do for us in times when we can not.We are happy when our friends achieve in life.I will be very happy when my children come first in school. This is what we call happiness caused by others.Purchasing compliments from executives in the workplace can be very rewarding.I get gift compliments because i work well.The first touch of a newborn baby kiss brings joy.Happiness is one of the most important things in life.We cannot achieve happiness if others focus on happiness.
