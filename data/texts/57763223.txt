              This an example for what we think we see becomes far more important than what really is ---its human tendency to judge others by their outer appearance, but is it fair a good physical appearance is the only parameter to decide the status and worth of a person.  i think it is unfair to draw  conclusions and opinions about others withour actually knowing them.  some people try to demean others by making a negative impressions,in order to derive a false sense of superiority and gratification.

                 generally people tend to make perceptions about others by outer appearance like their looks,complexion,dress etc.  they hold such preconceived notions about others in order to accept or reject them.  stereotyping makes people judge others with a closed mindset thereby hampers correct judgement.  we must not follow generally rules to judge others rather should develop our own set of standards.  this way we can stop making wrong assumptions by rejecting negative influences around us.

                 only external appearance cannot decide the personality of an individual. we also need to loo at his inherent inner qualities which are sometimes latent.  in order to manifest the true nature and qualities of someone, time is required.  a person with an ordinary appearance can be a great person.  irrespective of the physical differences, we must respect each others.
