Images and impression have too much affect or maybe it created an impact on people. Because what we seen is more important than what we read or what we hear.  we can remember some pictures or images more than years. 
For an example if we read a book after that that book turn into movie, when we watching it it'll receive a more accolades than the book get itself. But we can't assure that, what we look is real or true.It varies. In movies we can see actors performance, sometimes we fall for it and sometime we cried because we drowned in that story. but in reality that actors real character maybe or most of that are different.But we all admired them for their for that onscreen presence. Thinking about that what we see is more or maybe most important.In this most them believe what they see. Maybe they don't have a time for the research.
But some people agree that what they see is not real. because they know about people, society and most importantly reality.Even though we have some kind people as they look like the same inside and outside. But majority on this case is impression or images or what we see through our eyes is the most important thing and yes it will have huge effect on people. Maybe looks or apperence create some judgements. But the thing is how we look is what we are.
