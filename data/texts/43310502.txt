Are you happier focusing on person goals or the happiness of others? 

Some people may seem to be "all about" themselves while others would give the shoes off their feet to a stranger, what makes each of us feel "fulfilled" or happy is something to think about.

I have always been a person who enjoyed seeing others happy, my own needs have always been put to the side, there is just something fulfilling about bringing joy to other people.  This has become even more evident after becoming a prarent myself, my kids needs and happiness always come before mine. When shopping sometimes I have to hold off on getting the things I need to get the things they want. Aside from my personal family, I have always gone out of my way to help friends and even strangers.

Some people will say you have to worry about yourself first and others are self centered without realizing it. I have never understood being this way, of course you have to look out for yourself and do what makes you happy, but its equally important to do for others and look out for the next man/woman. I always say you never want to be a person in need of help and a bunch of people pass you by who are only concerned with themselves. For instance blowing a tire on the highway, phone battery dead and 5 miles to nearest exit, you would certainly hope there was a stranger concerned enough to stop and help you.

With that being said, it is a satisfying feeling when your in need of help wether physically or emotionally and there is someone wether friend,family, or stranger there to lend a helping hand or thought. This goes both ways, life is more enjoyable when we're all happy.
