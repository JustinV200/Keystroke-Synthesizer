The age old debate of competition or cooperation continues even today. Which is better? Which is more productive? To be honest, I think the answer is: it depends. I know you were probably wishing for a definitive answer, but I don't have one for you, and here is why.

Cooperation is great for a lot of people that like to work with others. They work well in groups, feed off of others' ideas, and engage regularly in group activities. People with a cooperative type personality would rather support and nuture the ideas of their fellow group members or coworkers than get ahead. They feel that when they win, everyone wins. Many times, this is true. When working in a group setting, often feeding off of each others' ideas can foster even better ideas and achieve goals faster.

And then there is the other side of the coin: competition. Many individuals have a very competitive personality and feel that when they win, someone has to lose. They are out for themselves and will step on anyone and anything in their way. They are ready and willing to do what they have to do to take first place. People with this type of personality actually work better under pressure and perform better when everyone is out for themselves. They don't enjoy working in groups and would prefer to work alone. 

So to answer the question of cooperation or competition is hard because I truly feel that it depends on the individual and their working style. A person's personality has a lot to do with what works best. Finding what works best for each of us is how we reach our best potential and how we are able to achieve our goals. Neither one is better than the other. They are just each different ways of getting to the same finish line.
