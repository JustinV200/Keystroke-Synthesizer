In this essay I intend to address the pursuit of happiness. There are people who believe happiness is obtained by pursuing their own goals, and then there are people who believe happiness comes from good deeds. I believe one is more likely to achieve happiness by focusing on their own goals first, because if you don't take care of your own happiness first then you cannot help others.

Focusing on yourself may seem selfish, but you can always help others after you have achieved your dreams. In fact you can help them more. For example if you become an attorney you can allow someone to apprentice under you. If you spend your whole life campaigning for charities and waving signs around it is unlikely you will ever achieve the wealth or influence to affect actual change. Mazlow's hierarchy of needs explicitly implies that you if you don't take care of your needs first, it's basically impossible to be happy or satisfied.

Without the proper resources and your own well being met it is simply impossible to achieve happiness, let alone help others. I believe happiness is much more likely to come from focusing on your own goals, because there's no viable way to achieve the goals of others without your own being met.

In conclusion many people will chastise those who seek to better themselves, they may call them cutthroat, they may call them greedy, but these same people often do much good in the world. So in the end if you take care of yourself first, all of your needs will be met, you will be satisfied with life, and then, if you so choose, you can always assist others in life.
