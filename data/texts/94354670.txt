Although it is easy to say, "who cares about stuff?!" it would be a simple oversight of the morals engrained in every day upbringing in America.  Materialism is intertwined with our notions of success, even when it doesn't result in the purchase of an item.  Success is then what pushes us towards further growth, competition, and better outcomes.  It could thus be said that without materialism, evolution would be slowed or even halted.

There are many reasons that materialism should not be criticized in the western world.  For one, it pushes people to continue to have more and more.  This leads to people working harder at work and in their relationships.  They raise their children to have more success so that their children can themselves gain more materials and experiences.  We, as a population, always want more and more, and are willing to do anything to get there.  It should not be criticized to always want more for ourselves and our future, even if it is in material items.

Although one could say that by constantly seeking more, a person does not truly enjoy what they have, I think when an item is earned and worked for it is enjoyed and valued.  Most people also have some sort of idea of a glass ceiling of materials or experiences they are likely to have, and do not put as much weight into things that are wildly outside of possible things they could have.  Disappointment thus is not continuous with materialistic thought.

Overall, materialism pushes humankind, and especially the western world, towards growth.  Without materialism society would become advanced in a much slower fashion, as extrinsic rewards are important in motivating people in all aspects of their lives.
