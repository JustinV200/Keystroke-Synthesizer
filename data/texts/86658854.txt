I do support that all around  us are mistaken for reality. In the virtual world peope are only impressed by colorful things , flavours and attraction of the product .  People often miss the reality of the things. Today, lots of things are easily mistaken.  We assume that every person in entertainment industries are live theri life happily but in reality they do suffer a lot.  
      
   People easily  judged by the apperance of the product rather then seeing the original  content.  Childrens are often attracted by colorful items but they did not think about consequences.  Most of the product are only attractive rather then healthy. In political world, people  do not understand the nature of the leader . They only belive election speech and elect the leader. It cause major problems in country. 

    Seeing real thing behind any content is very important in today's world because  we can understant every thing properly without mistaken. Mistaken cause major problems that even play with our life. It is important to teach our children to take the things properly without mistaken things. We have to aware about the appearanace of things.  Awareness about the reality is the only way to stop mistaken . So we try to find more infromation  before we mistaken.  We have to know the original consequence of the things before make any decison  because it save our valid life from unwanted stress.
