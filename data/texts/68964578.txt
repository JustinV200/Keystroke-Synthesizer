     Materialism is not a bad thing but people in the modern and fastest society should realize the most of other things in the world.Other than money and luxurious thing there is much much things make us happy and fullfill our life. ..   But now a days the young materialistic people not think those things. They  thought only buying things and own  a rich products make them happy and give a feel that they achive their goals while they are own a things. 
    
       Gods gave a wonderfull world for us and he created a such a loving relationsips with us . we should realize nothing can replace the love and care of our family and true friends . sometimes I saw some persons they are being selfish for that things and stuffs. 


     But people should controll that selfish charactoristic thoughts and realize the most piecefull and beatiful feel of love and care of relations and family and friends. from childhood we should practice and teach the chid how important is a people and society than things and stuffs. thats is the solution for chance the mentality of the next generation people.

   otherwise next generation also suffer with that materialism of things and stuffs and luxurious life.
