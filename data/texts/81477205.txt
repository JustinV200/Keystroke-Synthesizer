     People are more likely to be happy if they focus on personal goals instead of the happiness of others.  This is because I believe that to be happy you have to make your own goals and attempt to fulfill them.  Fulfilling these goals can make your life much more happy and you could be a more complete person. Things like this are just important because people always want to have their own completions without the help from other people.
     A big problem though with personal goals is that people sometimes are unhappy with themselves and cannot come up with any goals they believe they will be able to complete.  Sometimes their motivation is just too low.   This could be fixed by making small goals that are possible to complete and slowly make bigger and bigger goals.
     Lastly a reason that this rules over the happiness of others helping, is that not everyone is happy and it is harder for a lot of people to make others happy rather than themselves.  Personal goals are always an important key piece to your life that even doctors will tell you can help.  As long as you try it you can feel more complete in your life and it could still just help you.
     As a conclusion, keep chasing your goals and you will find yourself much happier.  Aim at happiness and you will find the way.
