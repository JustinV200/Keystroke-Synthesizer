Materialist living, Does it really benefit society that much?
Well in short yes it does, think about how good it felt last time you bought something you'd been waiting for.
It's just the way people show status in these times, Having more or "Flexing" as the younger generation would put it shows you are well off and valued in society today.
At this point many peoples lifestyle is completely based on materialism. 
You most likely wake up every day and go put in a hard days work just to buy things you need and want, That's materialism in it's own sense.

Some would critisize and say we place too much value on possesions we can't take with us when we go.
Yet even those people surely have a home filled with things they have collected,cared about, and cherished.
So in our own ways we all live a more or less materialistic lifestyle.
This way of living might not suit everyone but in the end it is just the most beneficial way to do things.

You never know when you might need some extra cash or your neighbor needs help trimming some weeds.
All those material things hold value be it directly via being sold or transitory by being lent or borrowed.
So in the end no society shouldn't be critisized for being materialistic.
