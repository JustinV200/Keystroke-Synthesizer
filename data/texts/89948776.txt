In the modern day, we are constantly surrounded by advertisements, product placements, and billboards. Celeberities rake millions of dollars by solely using products given to them by companies. Why is this? Well, humans are social creatures that strive to camoflauge and fit in with each other. This gives rises to trends, fads, and other social phenomenon. However, many of these products are quite subpar, built to be replaced in 2 years or less. This promotes non stop consumption and fast moving trends. This further pushes the current standard. 

The effects of adveritsing work well. Companies spend billions of dollars each year on marketing, advertising, and other ways of getting their product in your face. If this didn't work, why would companies still be doing it? It's a highly effective tool for you to spend more money. The advertisements lead people to choose the product, even if it's inferior to other products. Seeing your favorite public figure with a products sways peoples choices. This isn't the most rational choice that a person can make. Doing research into the products you choose, and comparing them to find the best product for you is the correct thing to do. Yet, many follow the likes of entertainers and politicians. 

There must be a decoupling of public figures and corporate products to help promote a more logical and rational consumer base. The usage of this type of marketing is pushed strongly in child marketing, which is being banned by several nations. The sway of marketing and impressions is very strong, and until decicive action is taken, it will continue to be an extremly strong force. Corporations and governments must lessen the effect of advertisements to promote a more consious consumerbase.
