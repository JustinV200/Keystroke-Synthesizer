People on very different corners of this planet may be surprised to find themselves repeating the same daily cycle as those across the globe. The same activities: work, sleep, eat, and repeat cycle through on repeat daily for billions of people. Yet, do these redundent tasks have a meaningful purpose? 
One could dream that after working such a monotonous schedule a reward would only be fair. Afterall, doesn't everyone fantasize about a tropical vaction on an exoctic island? Watching shows about the rich and famous enjoying lavish lifestyles with glowing grins instills a dream in many people. The high life of the elite seems so fascinating. They have so many  expensive things and so much money, that one would be insane not to be complacent at all times.  
It seems as if this level of achievement is a goal for many. Although modern society is caught up in exploiting the negatives aspects, by oftentimes mocking celebrities of their financial blunders, it is an act of jealousy. Everyone would love that level of attention and fame to be associated with them, but for many their dreams will not be coming true. They will continue to work the day away for their mediocore money, only to find themselves falling further away from the life they really want. In the meantime, they will likely find themselves judging the rich who simply will drown out their sounds with nothing but the best of anything! 
It seems as though money can buy happiness. It would have to be difficult to not find joy in being able to do anything. It is often said, "money can't make one happy." However, those that seem to have the most of it appear to be those with the most happiness. Which all seems to stem from the same root, material things.
