I know that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. I was once caught up in clever advertisements until I began investigating and researching on my own.

When I was younger and I watched a lot of TV I was swayed by what I saw; whether it was commercials or TV programs (news, series, etc). This was affecting me in a negative way.
I started to read books that helped me realize that there is too much catering to materialistic, vain, superficial desires. Too many commercials, programs, etc touting younger looking faces, bodies, etc. Too many commercials, programs, etc "telling us", "showing us", "swaying us" to believe what they are "selling us"; whether it is a product, a person (think candidate for whatever office), an image, etc.

You may think that this is important in your life but I am telling you that it is not. What is important is to be a decent, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving human being. To help those that are less fortunate than you. If you have the means, the time, the resources to help those that are less fortunate than you then you have the responsibility to do so. Forgo the unimportant "things". Do you own research on what "they" are bombarding you with.
