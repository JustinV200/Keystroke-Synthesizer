  Competition is one of the most important things in life. It drives people to do better in life and try to get ahead. As I was told as a kid winning isn't everything it's the only thing! I live my life this way, I don't care if it's a game of cards I play to win. On the other hand there are some situation were cooperation would be the better way to get things done in the work place. Say for example your working with a team on a project at work if everyone works together the end result would most likely turn out better for everyone.                                    
  But as you know you will always have the 10% as I call it.  That one person that will do anything to get ahead of others and make them look bad. 
  So all I can say is work hard and play hard try to stay on top but don't let pride stop you from coorerating. There is a fine line between competition and cooperation. Watch your back for that coworker that will steal your work to get ahead. In closing I would like to say I love competition, but there is a time and a place for it.
