Is competition or cooperation more important for success? While both produce results, cooperation between large groups of people produces more significant results than competition between individuals. 

Humans are by nature social creatures and often motivated by interpersonal relationships. A sense of community and comraderie helps drive people to do their best. People like to have a common goal and enjoy coming together to accomplish it. Setting aside differences and empathizing with others helps people grow and learn new things. 

Because of its individualistic nature, competition drives people apart. Even though competition may cause an individual to create their best work, the combined work of a large group will be more significant than just one person's efforts. While competition can produce new ideas, cooperation will see those new ideas come to fruition. A well-organized, cooperative effort can effect more change than one competitive person or small group of people. Competition may produce short-term change, but being competitive day in and day out is exhausting. Cooperation allows people to share the workload. Competition may reward a "winner" or punish a "loser," but cooperation is rewarding in and of itself for everyone. 

Overall, cooperation in the world will create better conditions for everyone. Imagine a world where everyone shares ideas, communicates well, and cooperates instead of competing against each other. Imagine all the things humans could accomplish!
