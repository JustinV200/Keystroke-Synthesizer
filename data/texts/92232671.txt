The curse of materialism.  The need to aquire and keep more and more things.  Humanity has gone from extreme minimalism to extreme materialism.  Should we be criticized for being materialistic in modern times? If a time-traveler from the 1800's visited us today, they would say absolutely.  However, times change.  Materialism should not be criticized today, as we as a society have learned to keep and reuse if we are in the poor class, and go bigger and bolder if we are in the rich class.  It is the way things are today.

There are valid arguments to this case. For example, hoarding items and people classified as "hoarders".  While most will agree that hoarders do not need to keep the amount of things they have hoarded away, including trash, newspapers, books, sentimental items, and clothing, hoarding in itself is a mental disorder and should not be applied to this argument. Our economy alone would not survive if it weren't for the constant supply and demand of goods.  Materialism in itself is a necessity for modern times.

As a whole, society has drifted from our history of minimalistic ways.  We no longer have to walk to the river to collect water.  We don't have to build our shelters with our bare hands, nor churn our butter.  It is a luxury to be able to buy what we need, and collect what we wish.  This luxury should be embraced, not criticized.  

Do we need to be this way? The short answer is no. Society did just fine living off of the land and practically having nothing but the clothes on their back and what they could make.  Is it wrong to embrace modern materialism? No. If you can financially do it, enjoy it. Life is short, and we should be focusing more on what makes us truly happy versus how others judge us.
