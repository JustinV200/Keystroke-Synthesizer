People who prioritise materials are not selfish. it is actually misunderstood as way to have actual happiness. Peace and fulfillment are brought to the people only throgh love. so materialism should be criticized. 
Desire for materials only leads to an endless appeal, this is clearly evident as we see lot of rich people are devoting themselves to the charity.  materialism should exist only for enhancing our lives and also to meet our basic needs to improve ourself. But nowadays earning money has become an ultimate goal in life for many people and they keep their life and health at risk for earning more money. Such activities of running behind the materialististic world and earning money deprive people of their sense to love, care and beautiful things like emotions. 
People are becoming robots in this technological world and running for luxury in their life. having luxurious life is not wrong but sacrificing once happiness for luxury should not be appreciated. we should earn for living and also to meet our basic needs but we should never keep our life, happiness and health at sake for that. nowadays we see no family bonding in the society. this has to be changed. Being materialistic should be avoided.
