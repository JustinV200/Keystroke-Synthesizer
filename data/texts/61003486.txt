           Yes. Absolutely now a days advertisements and promotions of a products explains nothing about or very little detail about the product but they cleverly creates an impression and good image about the product among us. And we also accept those products because of the impression created by the entertainers , politicians and celebrities.
          All we need to do is we want to raise questions against the promotors about the product and owner of those brands to print or publish the detailed content or what kind of components is used on that product to the people. And that is publicly visible to the common people. Then only they fully know about the product after that people automatically buys the products if it truly usefull for them.
         Most of us only focusd only about the coloful packages and the appearance of that product we don't even consider about what type of components or ingredients are inside that package. We need to grow up our mind to raise questions boldly about the product because we have all consumer rights to raise a question about a product . Few peoples already got awared about the tricks of  advertisers and promotors . We really need to know what is important than advertisements . Only focus on the reality and orginality of the product.
