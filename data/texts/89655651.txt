The real happiness comes only by pursuing their dreams come true. Everyone had their own dream and goals but all are not achieving it. A person who win can understand the real happiness of acheivement. The man own happiness is a temporary but if a man make others people happy will give a deep feel of happiness for life. 
I had understand this at my age of 25 started a goal to help others that gives me lot of happiness and still I'm likely to help people as much as I can. My mom always say about the people who helped them when she was young and ask me to help others to say thanks for the people who had helped my mom. 
When I was young my mom lost me in a town that time a grandmother helped me to find my mom after five days still she took more care on me as her own grandson. Really even though a small help will make the people smile that gives us a lot happiness. We all are kept in a economic status is just to help the people down to us. 
God will always help us If we help someone. I also had a goal to earn more to help more people as much as I can in my lifetime.
