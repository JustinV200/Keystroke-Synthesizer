People are more happy if they concentrate on the happiness of the people around them such as friends and family and even strangers.  People like to do things for other people and are happy to do so.

Many people have a lot of problems.  It is sometimes hard for people to get through the day.  Someone  should make sure that these people have some happiness in their life.  It would lift their spirits and give them a brighter outlook. 

 If one concentrates on one's own happiness, one sometimes forgets about other people because they have to much going on in their own life.  Other people then might feel left out or neglected and left out.   Focusing on one's own happiness is a little bit selfish because others don't benefit from anything being directed to them for their happiness. Focusing on one's own happiness may not result in a positive experience.  However, making other people happy can result in a good experience for eveyone involved.

People who make sure others are happy indirectly allow themselves to be happy knowing how they have made other people feel.  They benefit from the satisfaction of the result of other people's reaction and gratitude.  For example, making a stranger happy might mean much more than is indicated by the stranger.  It might be the only time that they experience anything pleasant. Family and friends being happy should be a priority for everyone.

By making other people happy eveyone benefits.  Happiness helps people to forget about their problems.  I think it is better to do what is necessary to bring happiness to other people.  One never knows what other people have on their minds and what they deal with on a daily basis. One's own happiness can be derived from making others happy.
