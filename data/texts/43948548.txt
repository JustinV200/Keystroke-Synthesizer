Happiness is something that we, as human beings, all want to obtain.  The best things in life are the things that make us smile.  Often times our own desires are obtained by us setting personal goals and achieving them, and that does feel very good and will make us feel happy, but that kind of happiness often lasts for just a short amount of time.  Then some negative realities of the mundane world will set in, or we backtrack on one of our goals because we're only human, and humans aren't perfect.  So how do some people always seem to be so upbeat and happy all of the time?  

True, long lasting happiness is that which comes from within.  It comes from within due to a feeling of purpose and fulfillment.  How does one go about creating a world in which they feel happy most days, if not every single day, of their lives?  They do that by making a lasting positive impact on the world and on other people.  Knowing that something, or many things, that you have done have helped to significantly improve somone else's life gives you a feeling of joy like no other.  
It's something that can't be lost.

Some people may say that you can't take care of anyone else if you don't take care of yourself first, and while that is true on some levels, personal fulfillment doesn't really come from focusing only on yourself all of the time.  There is a wide range of behaviors people can exhibit, from hardly taking care of themselves to being way too selfish.  Of course, truly loving yourself makes it easier to then love others.  Regardless of how one sees themself, giving to others and doing things for others often warms our hearts in a way that nothing else can.  Humans are social creatures, and knowing that you made someone else's day is often the best gift that you can give yourself (and them).  To feel connected, helpful, loving, and loved is what truly makes people happy.
