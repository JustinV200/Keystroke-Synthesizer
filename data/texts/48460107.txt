     Anyone criticizing modern society for its materialism is probably broke.  The Urban Dictionary describes "a person who is spiteful towards another person because they do not have the things of another , but wish they did " as being a "hater".  Thats right, it must be the haters of the world who are spreading this idea that materialsm is a bad thing, when in fact, it is beautiul.  
    In my lifetime alone I have known that more than half of the global population lives below the povety line.  The estimate was $1.75  a day and that seems impossible.   Now, in 2022 it is estimated that less than 11.9 % of the global population is living in that extreme poverty.  
    China is a perfect example of a country once living in extreme poverty to a country living in prosperity.  The more we buy and consume, the more good jobs and opportunity that country will have.  I say, good for them,  at least somewhere in the world people are making a good living and are thriving.  Who are we to complain?   
     Its not only China but most of South Asia and parts of the continent of Africa too.  Its amazing times we live in, so ignore the "haters";  because everytime a woman swipes a credit card at Ulta or Sephora, a small village in Africa has clean water for the first time.   Or when the Amazon van pulls up and unloads a handtruck full of boxes on your door- its ok because 200 kids are now getting an eduacation someplace in their new schoolhouse.
     Bill Clinton said it best with his 1992 presidential campaign slogan "Its the Economy, Stupid!"   So head to the mall and start spending, like someone else's life depended on it.
