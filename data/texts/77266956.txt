From a young age, many are taught that to win something is the only way to be successful in life. There is a very heavy burden that many carry around in their every day to day life. "Will I score more than my teammate?" "Will we beat the rival school soccer team?" "Did I exceed company sales goals?"  Such demands of perfection in competition often start from home with pressure of parents or parental figures, and competition with older siblings. Many children end up losing any aspect of fun that they once had in a sport or hobby because of the pressures from home and school. The stress not only takes away something that should be special for a child but it helps change the path in their adult life that they could have taken had they had less pressure to be a perfect competitor as a child. There are many challenges that start from childhood that we bring into our adult lives and excessive pressure is one of them.

Even though I do understand the need for competition because competition is a natural human nature, I feel that instead of expecting perfection like a competition based environment does, we should adapt a teamwork approach that still allows healthy competition. After all, there is no I in team. Winning is important to many in order to feel good about the work done, but the bond that you can make from coorporating in a team can be better for character building and of course relationships. People have a lot to teach others and one can sometimes learn a lot more from working in a team vs working alone. Overall, it is in my personal experience that working in a coorperation setting achieves more success not only in the goal at hand but in fostering skills as well.
