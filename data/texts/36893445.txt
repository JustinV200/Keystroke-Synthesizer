I think that nowadays peoples are more becoming more materialistic.but in the older days the old aged peoples are not materialisti.For example our grandparents are not having a small button mobile phone.But in this generation small kids is not living without a smart phone or tab ..so that our grandparents and parents are save the money for their future use.In this days a things are more expensive.so wa cant save the more  money for our future purpose.by the addiction of the materialistic things we can cant focus on our spacious home and we cant spend time with our family members.A materialistic mind set can drive people to overspend or buy things that they cannot afford yet.but  money is more important in our life.so we may reduce to buy the materialistic items.for me money i believe that money is not eveything but it is undeniable that without money.no one cannot survive in the w orld.but we have to enjoy our life at the same.but nowadays people more focused on wealth and improving their standard ,they tend to forget matters that are substantial in life,namely healthy family and friends.nowadays people think they  are feeling shame if they are having materialisic objects.Thank you
