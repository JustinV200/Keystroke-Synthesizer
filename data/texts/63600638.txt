                        We should also didn't belive all people randomly.Now a days people are more deceptive than what we are thinking.For Example Entertainers, Politicians and other public figures.they imitate and deceive the people on thier abilities which is common for the society.

                        We should also did'nt belive in our friendship and relationship blindly which may hurt us in the end badly  without our notice.We should select our friends and partners carefully without the influence of their images and impressions.Thus we may not be deceived by them and also ther will be good relations around us in our hour of need.
