we all live in a  virtual world where everything is now virtual it is to hard to find people with great fashion they are too lean on their appearences they always judge people based on their appearences they find it correct but it is absolutely wrong they only believe their eyes and does not make true judgments they dont want truth just appearence is what they need they would even buy a poor product based on the fanciness they will not try to get the quality all they need is their appearence.

appearence will make them lose all trust once they find the truth they will not believe anything else they always fall for they fake appearence  that deceives them from true quality and experience they must comperhend to find the quality to appearence they must learn that appearence are deceptive.

media personalitites create a illution among their  fans and followers thet they boost a product by telling their fans that they use them infact they do not even consider buying those products we must understand that we should not believe whatever we see and we must get the quality we pay for, media people and celebrities they boost products for money we should not trust everything we se but we must fnd the true products of quality and should get deceived of appearences.
