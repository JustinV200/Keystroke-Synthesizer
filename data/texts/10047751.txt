Success is defined by many factors and it is respective to people who chase it. But in common, success need cooperation. Only with competion, one can't be successful in life. We need to be more cooperative with people who are around us to be more successful at everything we do in our day to day activities. Because, by nature, we all are dependent to people around us. With or without our knowledge, we do depend on other people on our day to day work routines.

By working together, we can do all works at ease. It'll be easy to solve a problem within a group than messing alone. We can get many work ideas and the same can be implemented easily only when we are cooperative. Competition wont give you success but cooperation does. 

With cooperation one can easily convey their needs and get achieved the same easily. Without cooperation, we can't do any work in any fields. Particularly in life and business, without cooperation, we can't get succeed anything. Because, everything needs cooperation. No matter how big or small the case is. 

Finally, competition is not the one which bring success to anyone but cooperation can bring all success in one's life.
