      Materialism is something that is easily criticized in today's modern society. People are often looked down upon for wanting more material things. People are criticized for purchasing more material items. But is this fair? It cannot be denied that material things can often bring people much needed happiness. Isn't that worth something? After all, can owning things that make people happy really be so wrong?
      Let's say that a woman really longs to own a luxury purse. It is an expensive material item that some would say is a waste of money. However, if this woman purchases one and it brings her joy, one surely cannot criticize her for that. For another example, if a man has dreams of owning a sports car and ends up finally being able to afford one, isn't that a positive thing? This man has probably worked hard to buy his dream purchase, which ends up making him thrilled. That cannot be something to be looked down upon.
      Some would argue that experiences are more valuable than material goods. A vacation or a concert experience would be something that people remember forever. This may be true but the idea behind this is basically the same. A vacation or a concert will most probably make the person experiencing it very happy. However, a luxury purse or sports car could equally give a person happiness. An experience is neither better or worse than materialism.
      The most important aspect of this argument is happiness. The saying that "money cannot buy you happiness" is one that is hard to agree with. If a person has money that allows them to buy a material item that makes them happy, then that quote is definitively false. One may criticize money. One may criticize material things. However, one surely cannot criticize happiness.
