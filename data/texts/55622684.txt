Success really starts with people working together. I always have belived that a house devided can not stand. I feel that applies to anything we do weather at home, in a job, or on a team. If people are not all going the same direction then it will be hard to get full potential out of the compay or team. 

Why is it so imporat to work together? It helps with less destractions, keeps people moving forward, keeps people motivated, and helps get the goal finshed sooner. I have been on teams were there was so much compitation that I did not even want to show up or talk about my ideas. I have seen people quit beucase there was to much compitation in the workplace. I also have seen teams that were so focus on working togeather that they out preformed other teams that had smarter people on them.   

Many people say good comption creates inovation but I would say cooperation creates great inovation. People say its all fun and it helps make people worker harder but I would say it only motivates a few and not the whole. Where as when you are all working together you are getting the whole team involed. All most all persons want to feel part of a team and will want to see it sucudeed if you help them cooperate the team will fly high and sore beucase they care about each others successs.
