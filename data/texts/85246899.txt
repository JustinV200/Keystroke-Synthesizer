  Have you ever wondered if there is something you can do to really get ahead in life? Have you wondered if you should treat everything as a competition so you can "win" in your life and at work, or be that helpful kind person who cooperates and builds with people over time? I'm here to tell you today how I truly believe that the way to success in life is through patience, kindness, cooperation, and work.   

I'm sure we've all know that person who is competitive in everything. That person who is not very kind in certain situations and is very cut throat, truly they can be aggrevating. It doesn't have to be that way though, you can achieve just as much success and more by cooperating with people. Over time that cooperation will blossom into trust and comfort for the people on the reciving end. It will take away any animosity that could form from always trying to outdo them. Learning how to work with others and communicate properly may not have instant results and promotions but with time people will remember you and the positive feeling they had when around you instead of the negative competitive ones. According to an article put out by forbes, a study was released that found when people cooperate with more group members over a longer period of time are more likely to emerge as leaders in the groups. If you take a look at other studys I'm sure you will find many other points that speak to you about the importance of cooperation with people.  

I understand there are people out there who probably think I'm crazy for saying this and the only way to get ahead is to plow through everyone to be the best. I'm sure theres people out there that to their core say that there can only be one that rises. All I can say to them is the evidence speaks for itself, and good luck. This puts to rest the old saying that the nice guy finishes last.
