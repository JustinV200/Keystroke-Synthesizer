There are too many people nowadays who are concerned about material things.  Individuals who are materialistic fail to see what is most important in life because they are too busy focusing on material objects. I feel that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because many individuals in our society are going without things they need, while others who are materialistic spend their money frivolously on items they do not need. 

Individuals who are materialistic fail to see things that should and would be considered more important than material things to most people. These things could be family, friends, loved ones, children, religion, happiness, etc. When focusing their attention on material objects, these individuals fail to realize the importance of all these other things in their lives.

Some people argue that being materialistic is not a bad thing because they are only trying to acquire material things that they feel they need or that will make them happy. Most people who are materialistic tend to put other individuals down who do not seek out material objects to make their lives more complete. Although materialistic individuals feel they are better than others who are not materialistic, individuals who are not materialistic have a better sense of themselves and what makes them happy, which does not involve buying material items. 

Today, there are many individuals in society who are materialistic. There are others in society who are not materialistic who feel that those who are materialistic should be criticized for their beliefs. I feel that being materialistic is similar to being greedy and that those in today's society who are materialistic should be taught about the importance of family, friends, happiness, love, and so on. As learning and valuing these items would be better than being materialistic.
