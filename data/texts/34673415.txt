Happiness is an emotion which we can experience very rarely in our inner soul, while we do things which makes us personally happy. Especially for womens the happiness is what they do for themselves. But the males in this society think that females should do things which makes the whole family happy, see how selfish are males in this society. I am not blamming all the male here, but there are some people who dont understand "what is happiness for women?" or "what brings happiness in women?.

According to the topic if we consider on whole as peoples, the majority would be when they follow their personal goals they experience the happiness more. Let me say my own life as an example, I personally stick to my own goals first to make myself happy. I worked so hard and I succeeded in my career with my husband's support, and it was the first and foremost thing which brought happiness in me, and I did experienced it. I always love to follow my own path in my life, because it made me personally happy and gave me the power to make my whole family happy too.

I am not saying that everyone should follow thier own personal goal and let the family goal or the other goals down, both the personal goal and the other goals are eaqually important to lead a happy life. But the people who follow their own personal goal first are more happier than the people who follow others goal. One more benifit of following their own personal goal is "The succes of your own personal goal would give you the power and energy to fullfill others goal." So, following your own personal goal would give you bliss.
