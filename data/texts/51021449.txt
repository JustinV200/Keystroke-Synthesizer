Materialism is widely criticized simply because it's an easy target. What is at the root of all our societal ills? When there is no easy answer "materialism!" of course is to blame. "Children get too many presents for Christmas" people say. But we could also admit that these types of answers are vague, and don't define social problems. 

Objectively speaking "materialism" isn't problematic because it simply refers to behaviors that are simply human nature. We like to collect things, and surround ourselves with things that we like. These objects comfort us and make us feel happy.

Humans are not unique in these feelings about collecting objects. Collecting behaviors have been observed in animal species as well. For example, young chimpanzees have been observed collecting stones which they carry around and treat in a way that's similar to young children playing with dolls. Birds and collect twigs, leaves and other materials to build comfortable nests. Beavers collect materials to build strong dams. The only thing different about humans of course is that we have civilization and commercial systems so we get our materials in shops, malls and mega-marts instead of in nature.

The dark side of our wonderful commercial system is that it can also inspire greed. For some people too much is never enough. And some people become obssessed with acquisition. Greed can lead to behaviors such as stealing, embezzlement, cheating and worse. If there was less to acquire, perhaps the crimes would not exist.

It's a good idea to understand that materialism is natural and should not be criticized or moralized against. And there is another known phenomenon. People are often attracted to behaviors that society criticizes. Maybe if people understood that their desire to acquire was perfectly normal, there would less greed, fewer crimes and people could find satisfaction in collecting the items that they like -- within reason.
