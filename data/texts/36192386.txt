It is often hard to tell the root cause of happiness between individuals. For some people, their happiness comes from doing selfless acts for others or from something along their path through life. Other people find happiness if they focus on themselves, their goals and what they want in life. Most people tend to be happiest when they are fullfilling their own aspirations and dreams which are deeply meaningful things to them. An example of someone achieving happiness through their own goals is a mountaineer/climber from Nepal. 

This paticular climber was in the British military and ranked the equivalent of a US Navy SEAL. He was the bread winner for his family that included his parents living at home. He was the only one who worked in the family. He quit this job with minimal savings and planning because he had a dream and a goal of climbing the 14 highest mountain peaks in the world. He started with little money and slowly worked on his goal through donations and his climbing progress. He left his secure job that provided for his entire family to persue his own goals that brought him happiness. At the same time, he was also trying to show how this personal goal of his was meant to inspire others.

While this climber set out to achieve a goal for his own hapiness, he was also trying to show people anything was possible. There are people who would have great happiness out of inspiring others and seeing them achieve and smile. This Nepalese climber encompassed both aspects that typically you only see one of in most people. Typically it is easier to focus on one's own goals and dreams for happiness because of already knowing the things you like and the goals you have. It is harder to find happiness along way if you haven't focused on your own happiness.
