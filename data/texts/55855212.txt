I believe materialism is the bane of our modern society. While our culture tends to equate material goods with success, particularly in this era of social media, it seems to me that people are more unhappy now than ever before. Anxiety and depression are rampant, as is the use of psychotropic drugs. That wouldn't be the case if the things we were amassing were really making us fulfilled and whole.

With the explosion of social media and the 24/7 news cycle, we have near instant access to information like at no other time in history. While on the surface that would appear to be a good thing, in actuality what it seems to be doing is causing constant comparisons to be made between ourselves and others. We see our favorite influencer on Instagram jetting off to exotic locations or purchasing the latest handbag or designer shoes. We then want those things for ourselves. Some people go into debt trying to keep up while others just get jealous and bitter that they can't have what they believe everyone else has. I'm fairly certain there have been multiple studies showing the negative effects that social media has on one's mental health, particularly with respect to teenagers.

Then there is the issue of responsible management of the Earth's resources.  With 7 billion+ people on the planet, we are consuming the Earth's resources at a rate which far outstrips the planet's ability to replenish them. This does not bode well for future generations.

In summary, I do think modern society is rightly being criticized for being too materialistic.  If we could learn to be happier with less, emphasizing community and connection with others, then we'd all be much better off.
