In an era when people are littering the planet with plastics, polluting the atmosphere with carbon triggering global warming, and filling landfills with the garbage from their conspicuous consumption, I think that it is safe to say that modern society especially in certain countries should be criticized for being too materialistic. 

We only have one planet to live on (despite certain tech bros seeming to think we can move to the moon or Mars or some other planet) so we should be acting in a way to conserve its natural resources and take care of it. Instead we are so interested in having more and more things and then discarding those things when we are tired of them that we pollute the planet both in the process of making those things and in the process of disposing of them by littering them or discarding them in landfills rather than recycling them. For example, fast fashion is known to lead to pollution both by the use of dyes in making the clothing polluting waterways and by the energy used in making the clothing leading to air pollution and yet instead of wearing clothing until it wears out and patching clothing or reusing the cloth from clothing to make other items, we buy more clothing than we need to keep up with the latest trends and discard clothing that is still in good enough condition that it could be reworn thus adding to the items filling up landfills or polluting the environment. In fact given the number of items of clothing I've seen littered around the Chicago area in the last year some people don't even bother to put the items of clothing they no longer want in the trash, they just litter them on the sidewalks, streets, and grass areas by sidewalks. 

In addition globalization means that more items are being made in various countries then shipped around the world leading to more pollution due to the transportation of goods across long distances using polluting fossil fuels. Whereas people used to buy items that were made locally or make their own items, they are now buying items that are made in various different countries and shipped long distances. Thus there materialism not only is problematic in the amount of energy used and pollution caused in the process of making all the items that they want but also in the energy used and pollution caused in the process of shipping those items around the world. Sometimes accidents occuring during the shipping process lead to addition pollution when for example cargo containers fall off of ships on occasion and spill their contents into the oceans there by polluting the oceans.
