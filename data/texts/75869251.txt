In todays day and age, flowery words and interesting packaging are often used to trick people into believing they are making good choices when, in fact, they are usually doing the opposite. 

For example, many people walk into stores every day looking for healthier eating choices, but usually don't know where to begin. This is where compaines come in claiming things such as '20% less sugar!' in their box of granola bars or 'Made with spinach!' on their pasta packaging. Often times, while this technically true, it is also false advertising as well. 

The box of granola bars can claim they have less sugar than the other brands, but only because they decided to make their bars smaller. The box now contains basically one less bar in total than it did before. So does the box cantain less sugar now? Yes, but it misleads the consumer into thinking they are choosing the healthier option when more than likely, they're better options avaliable. 

The same goes for the box of pasta. The pasta is colored green and looks like it would be a much healthier choice for someone who needs to cut down on carbs and eat more veggies. Of course when they see that it contains spinach, they feel better about their decision. In reality though, the pasta usually only contains an extremely small percentage of spinach and the consumer is still making a teribble choice in foods. 

Of course their are comapanies that stay true to the facts and let consumers know that while it is a 'slightly' better choice, that it still is no alternative to eating actual veggitables or cutting back on sugar. This though, is normally written in extremely small print that will not be read by people in a hurry or those that put blatant trust in what they see on the front of the package in large lettering. So in conclusion, people need to be more aware of what they are buying in stores or ordering online. Don't trust what you see at first glance.
