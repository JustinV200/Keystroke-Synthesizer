There are two views of thought regarding achieving success. Some people think it is a mad scramble to the top with the victor gaining the spoils. Others believe that working together like a team is what help people make accomplishments. 

I believe that cooperations wins out over a free for all rivalry. Some people thrive on competition and thus are more motivated this way. However, if others start feeling resentment, they will not be as willing to work with you. They might even decide to work against you.

Now, cooperating does leave room for people to be overlooked. They contribute a lot and no one notices. This is a problem but it can be handled by good management. But it is also important in this instance to toot one's own horn.

The best way to achieve success is by helping the group succeed. Others will usually notice if you are contributing. They will notice if you help them and most likely will want to help you too. Functioning as a team to accomplish a goal will leave the team members with closer ties. These ties can be useful in the immediate and in the long term.

The current belief is that you need connections and contacts to get ahead. Working well together and making a good impression will help build these connections. And while people like to be part of a winning team, they will still have close feelings toward those who were in the trenches with them, if they fail.

It is also accepted that people can accomplish more while working together. A single person cannot do as much work as a group. A group of people all trying to compete to shine will not like to share ideas. They will want to get as much of the credit as possible and this will hinder the group's chance at meeting their goals. Therefore, overall cooperation will produce more and still let a person succeed.
