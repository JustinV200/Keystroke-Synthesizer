Some people find happiness by focusing on their personal goals. Other people find happiness by focusing on the happiness of others. People are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of others, but not at the cost of forgetting about their personal goals.

My life and world outlook have been significantly influenced by my religious beliefs. I was raised as a Conservative Jew. Not only did I attend Hebrew school as a child, I continued to study religion after my Bat Mitzvah and graduated college with a bachelor's degree in religious studies. My religion heavily emphasizes the importance of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. One key way of doing this is by performing acts of community service. 

I also attended a Quaker high school. The Quaker religion also places a high value on community service. My school even had requirements for mandatory in-school and out-of-school community service that had to be fulfilled each year. 

These two religious examples show that religion recommends putting the happiness of others before focusing on personal goals through regularly doing community service. Community service has a more widespread benefit than only focusing on personal goals. That is why the happiness that is derived from it is longer lasting.
