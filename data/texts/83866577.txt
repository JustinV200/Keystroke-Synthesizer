    Every successful person has a different success story. Some people achieve their goals only  through their hard work and competetive spirit. Somebody achives their goals by sacrificing something or cooperating with others. Every path has their own positive and negative attributes.
    Acheive goal only by their hard work was a powerfull success. But It requires a lot of  effort and lot of time and immersive patience. In the middle of the process we have to face a lot of distructions. We need a lot of will power and self courage to stand with the goal we choose. Everyone have a set of characteristics and moral values in their life. Competetive persons often not give up their moral values for success on their goals. 
    Cooperative people often choose the path which compramise their moral values for their success. These kind of people want to success on their goals, at the same time they try to please and satisfy everyone around them. We can't satisfy everyone around us. But these people compramise their important works and success for pleasing people around him. But competetive people only focus on their goals even it hurts others.
    Success is a not a permanent thing. Our moral values only take permanent place in our life. So competetive persons who not give up on their moral values are the real achievers.
