Introduction:

     Money is very important thing in life. I would like to shore the agains and losses that have happened in my life. 

Reasons and evidence:
     
     Our family is a very troubled family. When I was studying, My parents were struggling without money to going to school. I didd not study well then. Then I thought of a goal that I should somehow study well and get a job anad buy my parents what I wanted the most. No one among our relatives helped me to study. My relatives scold me a alot if you don't study, you family is suffering anad you go to work.  

counterargument and rebuttalas:

     I studied well before them aand came first in the classroom. I worked part-time while sitill in my studys. I also completed my college studies. I got a very good job. I fulfilled the needs of my parents. In front of my relatives we were very happy. Much to their astonishment we attained a very hight position in society. I achieved my goal against my relatives.


Conclusion:

     We should not care what others say we should be happy with what we have and focus on our goals in our endeavors. What we should learn in our life is not to offend anyone.  Me and my parents didn't care about anyone out there and we did our best with what we had and we progressed in my life. 

                                                                    Thank you
