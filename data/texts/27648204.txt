Cooperation or competition success depends on the person. People tend to differ in the kind of environment that they will succeed in. Personality, genes, upbringing, all affect how the person will best approach the world. Some people are built for the competition and others aren't. Now I'm not saying that a person can avoid the reality that events happen in our lives that force us to be thrown into moments where we either have to compete or be cooperative but generally speaking even when thrown into either event one will see that some will be react better at the event than another. For example, you can't throw a person interested in science into a CEO's chair and expect them to do well. Same goes for a CEO being thrown into a lab. The requirements of personality are different. Labs require collaboration while chief executive position requires one to compete. So depending on the environment and person, one is a better option to the other. Now you might say that, well what about moments that require one to be cooperative and competitive such as a football game, a team based videogame competition, or a rowing race? I would say that my argument still holds because as I said before, it depends on the person.  Some people will have had experiences that led them to be good at both in unison. If they would be put into a situation where only one was needed, they will likely not perform as well. All in all, I don't think that one or the other is more likely to lead to success. It depends.
