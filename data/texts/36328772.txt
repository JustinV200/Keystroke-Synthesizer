Advertisements are important for companies to use to get their brand and products out there to the public. However, do they go too far with their choice of showing off their products? How much do their choices of images and impressoins affect people that see them?

I believe the images and impressions companies use to promote their brand and products does have too much effect on people. They are smart and strategic in picking colors and designs that are going to draw your eyes straight to it. They choose things that will get your attention. The companies make sure that when you are looking at all of the products on the shelf, their's will be the one that stands out and pulls your focus to it. 

Companies are also smart by using famous people to promote their business, brand, and products. They strategically choose celebrities or athletes that are wildly popular and well-known in that moment. The problem with this is that those celebrities or athletes may endorse that product without ever using it or trying it. They make it seem like it's the best thing to exist, but sometimes won't even touch it. However, because people want to be just like those they idol, they will use it without a second thought. 

I agree that companies have the right to advertise. They rely on advertisements to bring attention to their products. However, I believe that if someone is going to endorse that product and tell their fans they should use it, then they should also be willing to use it.
