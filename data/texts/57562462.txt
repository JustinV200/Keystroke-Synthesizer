As everyone knew the first impression is always a best impression, in below i am going to take product as a topic to prove hoe image and impression have impact on people ,this is because kids and adults do get attract more with the colorful  of the products rather than the quality,they pay more attention to the cover and the pubic influencer who promotes the product,even i do accept this beacuse i sometime do pick the product based on the promotion done by the influencer.

The public influencer has more followers and  fans ,so people do believe in their thoughts and messages that lead to buying of the products, the product gets easily reached only by the
promotion and so large amount is spent to attract people by using public influencers for their promotion,now many promotes their product by youtube many common people use this.

I do conclude my above saying that positive vibes are always needed for a better life,so obviously attractive images and impression are always needed to grab attention and there is nothing to lose, this seems to be one of the ways to express their thoughts and ideas,everything depends on the perception of the people.on the above i just explained my ideas by using product for the better eand easy understanding.
