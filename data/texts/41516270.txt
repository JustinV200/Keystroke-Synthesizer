   We were all taught when we were little "Don't judge a book by its cover", but in the world that we live in today, we have been conditioned to take things at face value. With the rise in technology, individuals are constantly being bombarded by advertisements, news drip, and the everyday lives of their fellow social media users. Have these constant bombardments had too much of an effect on people? In my opinion, yes. 
   In the wonderful day and age of 2022, it isn't unusual for the average human to roll out of bed in the morning and open their social media accounts to see what they may have missed over the short six to eight hour hybernation. If they don't partake in social media, they will absolutely see/hear uncountable amounts of advertisements on their drive to work. With these images at our every turn, it is understandable that individuals would start to forget the "old timey" values and morals we were raised on and grow accustomed to judging a simple image. Something that many people forget, is most people don't want to post the negative, or ugly parts of their lives on social media, making it seem that everyone has a better life than the next. It is natural for a human to want to compete with another and because of these "false narratives" that people share, many begin to believe that they aren't smart enough, pretty enough, rich enough, etc. This in turn causes other issues such as mental illness, depression, eating disorders and many more. 
   All in all, the constant images and impressions that indiviuals see multiple times a day, whether it be on a social media account, an advertisement, a YouTube video, etc. are painting a narrative that everyone has to be better than the next. This is creatating  a dangerous realtiy that constantly threatens indiviuals mental states.
