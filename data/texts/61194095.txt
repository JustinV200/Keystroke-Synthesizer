    Life is a precious gift for everyone in the world. But making it happy or unhappy is depending on their choice of living. Life is a good teacher to all of us. It teaches some lesson everyday. Life is full of happiness and sorrows. We must accept the life in its way. Happiness in life is with friends, family and relatives, and spending time for fun like party, shopping, playing, going for a movie etc., 
     Happiness is everywhere. We must enjoy our life without considering the sorrows. If we focus on sorrows we cannot live our life happily. We don't know our last minute in life so we must accept our life and make it meaningful. We can make our life beautiful by helping others, and giving things to the needy people.
     Life will throw you out or it will keep you in high. Whatever it may be, we should survive untill our last breath. Happiness is the essential thing in life. Humanity is helping the poor, feeding the needy and spreading love. We can make our life happy by making others happy. We cannot bring money, status, knowledge, jewels or anything. So we must give others. Not only money but also smile, gifts, care, support, mercy, love. By doing this we will fulfill our life in peace of mind.
