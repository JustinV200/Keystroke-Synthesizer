Happiness is brought by focusing on your personal goals. completing your personal goals leads to feelings of accomplishment, productivity, and satisfaction. Those feelings result in happiness when you feel like you are contributing and making progress in life. 
Your personal goals can be anything, including bringing other people happiness.  Bringing other people happiness can lead to improvements in social relationships and networking because people will enjoy being in your company if you are pleasant to be around. This can lead to completing other personal goals that are not about making others happy because others might be more willing to help you out and offer favors when you are friendly with them.
The downside to deriving your happiness from completing personal goals is that if you fail at meeting your goals that could lead to negative feelings and depression. Another downside could be that if one of your main personal goals is bringing others happiness then others might begin to view you as a doormat when they notice that you regularly put other's needs above your own. Lastly, personal goals can also be selfish or negative and can have bad affects on other people or the environment. 
Overall, completing personal goals can bring more happiness because I believe, for the most part, people's goals are to things that will personally affect them more. People are more willing to pursue goals that will bring them positive experiences than to bring other people negative ones. People might not go out of their way to bring other people happiness because most people are indifferent to other people's happiness. Even though someone's personal goal is bring others happiness, it is for a selfish reason which is for the person to feel good about themselves. This selfishness can work as a buffer to not always put others happiness above your own.
