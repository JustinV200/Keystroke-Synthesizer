According to the prompt i read and understand, the author talk about people happiness. He ask about people are happy when they pursuing their dreams and own personal goals or focussing the happiness of other people's happiness in the society or on the improvement of humanity.

In my own experience happiness are belongs to set their own goal and run towards successing their dreams and goals. That only make them happy. When they focussing on other people happiness, they cannot make themself really happy. I think that type of happiness not long last to them. It is only temporary.

When they achieve their goals they will feel the real happiness and keep that happiness to their upcoming generations in the society. When they focussing on others happiness,they cannot achieve their goals and dreams. It completely waste their golden time. This is my point of view. I met many happiest people in my life. They all are successful persons and happiest persons of their own life. They are real heroes in real life.

Coming to conclusion, when people set their goals and try to achieve their goals will make them happy and not by focussing the happiness of others. So believe your own thoughts and run towards to achieve your dreams.
