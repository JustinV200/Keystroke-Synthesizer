What is happiness and how does someone find it in their life?  Happiness is not actually a simple, stand-alone emotion; it is the result of feeling positive about your life and your circumstances, enjoying what you do and who you do it with, the pride of accomplishing a goal, even the awe someone feels watching something that amazing them that they can't understand.  Therefore, people can find happiness is lots of different places.  But I believe that having personal goals are pursing them is the critical key to an individual's happiness.  Having personal goals creates a sense of  purpose and meaning.  Pursuing and reaching those personal goals creates a sense of accomplishment, meaning and thus happiness.

Some people would say that happiness is found in focusing on bringing happiness to others, but I would argue that even that is a personal goal even though it may not seem like it without thinking it through.  Those who do for others are doing it because it is important to them and increases their own sense of meaning and well being.  For those who do have altruistic goals, the feeling they get when they help others increases their own happiness even as they bring happiness to others. Just because it's a personal goal doesn't reduce the important or impact of the actions people take to help others; the reasons are not important, only the results. 

Given this, someone who says they are only happy when they are helping others may not realize they are still doing it for their own personal reasons.  And that's okay, but it doesn't change the facts.  If it makes someone happier to think they have no motive, it really doesn't matter as long as they feel happy and get satisfaction from it.  But I still argue that bringing happiness to others is still a personal goal, thus what makes people happy is achieving the goal of bringing happiness to others.
