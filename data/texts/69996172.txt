  People all over the world have one thing in common.  They work to push towards the American dream of happiness.  It takes hard work and dedication to get there.  Some will cheat their way to the top while others put their blood, sweat and tears into it.  No matter how it's done, it makes people seem accomplished and respected when they are complemented.  It brings them much joy.

  I have found that people will lie, cheat and steal to make it appear that they are well off.  I have seen and heard how far people will go and it's so crazy to me.  Sometimes people take credit for someone else's possessions just to please others.  They have a desire to make it seem that they can do or afford whatever they want.  Many have even gone into debt trying to be people pleasers.

  When it's all said and done, I think that people care more about their own happiness and personal gain.  Most people only seem to care about their success and have no concern for people that are suffering or in need.  It seems very selfish but I have seen it happen more times than a little.  I feel that the world would be better off if we included a bit of both.
