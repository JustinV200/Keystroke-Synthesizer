In my opinion yes it is true..

                               Most of the peoples have images and impressions having more effectiveness on their life. Mostly images are more oriented in our life. Whenever we saw a image we smile. It changes our attitude on that moment.

                                If we saw a child image, it makes more impressions and happiness in our life. Older age peoples sawing a famly photo is most memorable part in their life. It remembers their life old things on that moment and make themself happier.

                                 For young aged people if we saw a horse running images, we also get motivated on that moment and make our self to run, run and runagain for their life. This image gives more motivation in my life to run and get job to earn more money in my life.

                                  For kids it is the fun part in their life. If they saw their kid time images they are more embarrased and more like to show their images to their friends and neighbours. It gives more happiness to childrens. 

                                  Our closest one , missing the person that doesn't we able to see in real life was seen only by their images we have. It gives much deep feel and make sorrow. Nobody needs to make us smile, happy, sorrow, cry. Just a single image we saw make all those things in real life.

                                    Really images give more impressions in all of their lives in this world.
