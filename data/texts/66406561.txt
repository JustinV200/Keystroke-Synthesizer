Without a doubt, people achieve more success by cooperation than by competition. Thinking back to Henry Ford's insistance in developing his one-piece, multi-cylinder engine idea, he did not go into a room, alone for months, and figure it out all by himself. He did believe though, that this problem could in fact be solved.

If he were to merely compete with other auto makers of his day, it might lead to intense hostilities, even baring the  teeth of violent backlashes against Ford's company, reputation- smearing and spying to find out Ford's secret sauce.

Henry Ford's experts took many months, disbelieving all the while, that such an engine would ever be possible. It had never been done before. It's impossible. They kept saying "It can't be done, it can't be done." Mr. Ford kept responding "Go back and keep working on it."

It may have taken longer than one year of being told to "Keep working on it" when to Mr. Ford's ears came words of glorious success that the engine he wanted was finally built!

Without cooperation with others, nothing great will ever be accomplished... not in business, global affairs, or personal lives. This truth can be proved repeatedly, on and on with multiple examples and testimonies to this day.
