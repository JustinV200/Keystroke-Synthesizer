Introduction:
                According to me to succeed we should focus more on cooperation than competition to succeed.  Cooperation and competition is necessary but cooperation could be more important. Competition makes us always try to be better than others and oblique to beat ourself. 
Position:
               Cooperation could be helpful and satisfactory but without competition it makes us forget  where we are going to and what we want to get.
Reasons and evidence:
              When i graduated from school i had to take an exam for going to university.we had prepares for the exam forming a study group that met every evening.Each one of them in a group bought their own notes from classes and different books and taught the other ones.so we covered all topics simultaneously.so we gotted good marks to join in a university.If i studied alone i cant get more marks and also all have gotted  a seats in a university but in my class a topper doesnt get a seat because he studied alone and not helped othersand looked as a competitor so cooperation is more important than competition to succeed.
Rebuttals:
               The natural tendency for humanbeing is to choose competion over cooperation.Competition exists whenever alternatives are compared.Competition is in the simplest and broadest terms a comparison
Conclusion:
             The clue to succeed was competion, cooperation helped but was not the most important Focusing on competition makes  to give the best,therefore it conduces to straight into success.
