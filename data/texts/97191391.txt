    I think that there are times that modern socity should be critized for being materialistic and sometimes not. I am going to express my opinions on why I think sometimes we should be critizised for being materialistic and sometimes we are not. 
   I do not think that our society should be so acceptable to marketing from large companies trying to make us by more products and more stuff that we do not need, this makes us materialistic. I also feel that the social media age that we live in now really exploits people and thier materialistic ways. I also think that big companies try to make you feel that you need these products to fit in and that these products are way to expensive for many people to own and they go into debt trying to aquire these products. These are some of the ways I think we should be critized for being materialistic. 
    In some ways that we are not a materialistic society and should NOT be critized is how we give our things away to people that are in need and give to like charities and things like that. These are ways that we as a society can give the too many things we have to less fortunate people who dont have many things. One persons trash is another persons treasure type thing.  This I feel makes our society not treasure our possessions that much and we want to share the joy that that possesion gave to us to  another person.
   In conclusion, we as a society are materialistic and that is brought on by our consumption of big corportations stuff being jammed down our throats. But we do not hold as much ownership to these materlialistic possessions, and like to share them with others. So we should be critized and we should not be at the same time.
