Yes, images and impressions do have too much of an affect on people in the present age. We compare ourselves to filtered perfection on social media. We are obsessed with projecting a pristine image our lives to the world. Every product looks amazing online. 

It is alarming that reality is blending in with the virtual. With augmented reality devices it will soon be difficult to tell what is real and what is fake. 

Some will argue that modern technoWlogy gives us the tools to project our best selves. However, these tools can be dangerous if used too cavalierly.

We are too obsessed with celebrity and appearances. We follow vapid people on social media. We retweet anything and everything at all. We all want the perfect lifestyle. We judge everything by it's package. We can only see what's on the outside. We look to people like entertainers, and sports stars, who are really just overgrown adolescents, and not role models, and think they have it all with their money and fame and we try to be like them and we try to put it all out on social media so we have the validation and attention that we crave.

In conclusion, modern society puts too much focus on appearances.
