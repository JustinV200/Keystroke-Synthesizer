Can you imagine a world without "things?"  It seems that a majority of our lives and our time is spent spending money and acquiring things....  or working in order to create funds to aquire things.  They say money can't buy happiness but, I am of the opinion that, it sure does help.  I think that materialism is too often criticized.  Does are society make too many purchases? Probably.  Is this a bad thing? I do not think so.  

I think that materialism promotes hard work and competition.  There are many things that I would like to purchase and these wants encourage me to educate myself and succeed at work.  

The other side of the coin is that materialism encourages people to overspend.  But, if there is a CEO that wants to have three houses and eat lobster for dinner every night, good for him!  It's still a free country.... citizens can choose how much they allow materialism to run their lives. 

As long as one person's materialism isn't hurting any other members of the society, we should let them spend their money and purchase items they choose to.
