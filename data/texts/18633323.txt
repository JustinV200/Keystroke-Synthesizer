     Everyone derives happiness in different ways and from different sources, but I think most people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of other people in their lives than on pursuing their own dreams and goals. One might direct happiness-causing actions toward close relatives or best friends, or toward strangers that they help in some way, thus getting satisfaction from doing a good deed for someone without expecting anything in return.
     Pursuing one's dreams and reaching one's goals can certainly be a source of happiness for most people and are important ways to achieve a fullfilling life. No one would deny someone the satisfaction of landing a dream job, making a lot of money, or achieving fame in one's field. Some people were just not brought up to make others' happiness an important goal or priority, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that.  
     But for people who selflessly do things for other people, there are few things more satisfying than making another person happy. This might take the form of relatively minor actions, like doing an errand for someone, or simply letting a loved one know how much you care about them. Or it could be a larger gesture, like donating time or money to a charity. Whatever the action, one cannot help but feel satisfied, fullfilled, or useful when one has increased the happiness of other person. All you have to do is remember the Golden Rule, and think about how you would feel if someone did something nice for you. You would be appreciative - and feeling appreciated is one of our most basic needs, and a definite key to happiness.
