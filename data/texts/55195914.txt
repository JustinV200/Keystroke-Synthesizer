It has been a debate for some time now as people wonder which brings the most positive result in the workplace and other areas of our lifes. Is it competition or cooperation? Some companies believes in using the competition approach while other companies think cooperation amognst it staff bring better results. It was previously and by most individuals agreed that cooperation is indeed a better approach to fueling success in every area of life and especially in the work place.

I personally also stand and agree with the motive that cooperation fuels successs better and faster more than being competitive. For instance in the workplace, competition focuses on individual strength, capacity and ability, which causes a flaw in the system and make employees battle against each order for a price and whatever cost. An employee will not be willing to give an assistance to a fellow colleague and secretly wants them to have a setback or not perform well due to personal interest and gain. Cooperation on the other hand keeps everyone working together as a team and allow them to support and assist any one in need to the best of their capabilities and achieving great results. 

Cooperation works well in family settings, in our prospective groups or gatherings and also in our different organizations. Though some still insists that competition fuels success faster than cooperation in certain organization for some different reasons. But the trutch is that the cons of competions is far greater than its pros, while the pros for cooperation is far greater than its con. To wrap it up, cooperation is still the best form of system to be incooperated in our daily lives to boost results to the optimal level without any negative bias towards a colleague or partner.
