In today's world, people are more materialistic.  This means that people are more prone to material things around them.  Materialistic things which in turn means , dressing up very well, having more ornaments, possesing a lot of good clothes, watches, shoes, etc.,  These things fits  the word materialistic.  This word simply means projecting oneself as a more luxurious person even if they earn or possess a very scarce amount of money.

This was not the case few decades back.  Our fathers and forefathers are not this much materialistic ones.  They earn money for themselves and for their family, they spend money for the things which are most needed for them and saves the rest.  In fact, during those days, they all were used to buy good dressess and things only when there are festivals.  For the rest of the days, they even will not think of those stuffs.  Their ultimate motto was to save money for the future generations.  This case is vice versa in recent days.  In the current world, people around us think of spending money more rather than thinking of saving money for the future generations.  They justify this act by saying that, there is no purpose of saving money for the future generation without enjoying our own life.  This in turn paves the way for a materialistic life.

This kind of behaviour prevails more in modern society than in rural areas.  Since rural people were not aware of the materialistic life that much, they were not prone to it.  But the people in cities used to be the ones who are indulging a lot in this kind of activities.  Wishing for a materialistic life is not a sin, but people should understand the reality too.  They should save some amount for themselves for the things which are not even expected in the future.  Thus we cannot criticize people for being so mnaterialistic.  It is their own life and their freedom.
