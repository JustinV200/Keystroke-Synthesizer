  Materialism in our society and world is something that needs to be pursued in moderation. There are many reasons for this; emotional well-being, keeping societies' priorities in check and concern for the environment. 

  There is constent overt pressure and subliminal pressure all around us, everyday, to have the best things, collect as many things as possible and show off to The Jones how "well" we are doing. However, the standard of living has become too high and is not sustainable. It is a negative thing because of the shallowness of it all and the amount of time it takes away from healthier things such as spending time with famiy and friends. It takes away leisure and proper rest times. It takes away from having hobbies. 

  The situation has gotten worse with the rise of social media. There are always messages, ads and photos of people with their latest, best outfit or new house and car bombarding us if we let it. 

  There is an emerging counter-culture starting to appear with the "tiny house" popularity and shift to full-time RV living. People are going back to the "old days" in terms of having gardens and chickens and looking for better ways of living to sustain the environment. There are a lot of Youtube channels showing people in their 20's and 30's rejecting the material life. They own their small cabins, have no mortgage or rent and get to spend much more time living their lives now, not when they turn 70.

  I am hoping that society in the future breaks away from this obsesssion with material and takes some cues from earlier societies like the Native Americans. Let's hope that huge homes and massive material collection either goes out of fashion or we get forced to change due to limited global resources.
