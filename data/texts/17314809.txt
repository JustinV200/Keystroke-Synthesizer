I think it's difficult to say that images and impressions have an over large impact on people.  Images and impressions are very important on their own.  To say that they have "too much" of an effect on people is to deny just how important these things are.  They're important for a reason, even if that leaves an unsatsifying conclusion about human beings.

Throughout all of human history, being able to make snap, quick decisions based solely upon what we saw was of vital importance.  Being able to know at a glace if a person was healthy or sick, strong or weak, or if food was spoiled was a life or death situation.  Today, maybe these things are less important, but that doesn't change the fact that we were built to judge things on their appearance and that, historically at least, those judgements have been sound.

Yes, there are problems that come along with this.  The "halo effect" that allows attractive people to be seen as more important or smarter than they really are can cause a detriment to society, but I doubt that the damage done is of major concern.  Also, a lot of advertisement is visually driven in an attempt to persuade people that a less valuable item is more valuable than it otherwise should be.  However, with time and proper guidance, people can be taught(or, in the worse case, learn from experience) just what they cannot actually believe with thier own eyes.

Images and impressions are important.  They have served us well throughout the lifetime of our species and I would be suspect of any attempts to curb our reliance on them.
