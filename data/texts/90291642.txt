Materialism has been found to create a trend of "the more you make, the more you spend". I can first hand attest to this. It's become a natural reaction in our society to keep getting bigger and better things, rather than focus on the "here and now". It  is a love-hate relationship; we love to make more money, but we hate how focused we've become on the material aspects of our lives. We always want the newest iPhone when it comes out. We stand in lines to shop the day after Thanksgiving at 3am. And for what?

So, the question is: should we as a society, be criticized for being materialistic? I think the answer to that can vary. It will vary depending on your financial status, how you choose to obtain those materialistic things, and it can also be effected by our economy. Right now, our economy is not in a great place. We're at an all-time high rate of inflation, yet people are still taking trips, vacations, and spending money like it's 1964. When inflation is high like it is now, it make me wonder what things were like before the 21st century. Are things different now because of technological advances?

I think when times are tough, we should be more critical of ourselves. We should reflect on our purchases- do I really need a new car right now? Or can I wait until the economy is looking a little better. Am I doing this to impress my peers, or am I close to having a car that is falling apart? If we are criticizing others for their material things, we are just becoming a part of the problem. If we feel judged for our belongings, we are just feeling more pressure to buy and upgrade unnecessary items.
