In a world of internet, we people are over exposed to the things which are not real rather than believing in the things which are true.  We are fond of things which impresses us in the first sight.  This practice  came into our life by seeeing lucrative advertisments in and around us featuring film stars and celebrities.

We cannot totally blame advertisements as it is a mere way for promoting their products for entrepreneurs.  But there should be something real in case of advertisements. 

Be it a soap advertisement or one, the ads generally advertise soaps by showing the foam and people generally gets attracted with that foam and they intend to get that particular soap.  But what acutally a soap advertisment should look like is that, the ultimate purpose of the soap is to remove the stain from  the clothes.  But people do not investigate whether it actually goes well or not.  They even forget the ultimate purpose of the product and get attracted by the fake advertisments.

Thus it is easily seen that people get too much attracted with the images and the impressions that a product is shown in the way in public.  Even a well educated politicians, entrepreneurs, entertainers commit this silly mistake of promoting a product that are not really true.  This is really a saddest part that we are crossing in our daily life either knowingly or unknowingly.  As there are two faces for a coin, there are two sides for each and everything around us.  Its is in our hands to choose things wisely to lead a peaceful life.
