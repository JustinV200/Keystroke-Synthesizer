This world  has  the largest population and there is a lot of people's are living in this extended world .but nowadays the world and the world living people's are going to be more materialistic and they are going to industrial based technologies .for example we assumed that china is the most independent society and it is also going to be a materialistic life. 
the people's are always think about the materialistic things such as robotics, and electronic devices ,etc.
                    But the truth is the people's lives in china they didn't know the reality of life and they didn't think about the family , relationship, love, friendship etc. In such way the world should going to the materialistic things the world should not have the thinking of  the root of love and family . In another way the world should be developed by robotism, electronically and industrially advanced but in other hand there is going to be the root of the world should be shaken by this type of thinking .
                   Nowadays there are a lot of people didn't know why they choose their profession and career to be like this. But the reality is  we didn't underestimate now.there is a lot of modern thinking  and modern society is living to be here but in our relationship and to be a modern thinking of the think doesn't value them.
                    People will more criticized for being materialistic and it should be sometimes makes us to be the unwated materialistic human being. there is not at all the society should be the materialistic world and it is takes us sometime to the core of the stuff. 
people may criticie the modern society for being materialistic, but the fact remains taht most of us psend most of our energy producting and consuming more and more stuff. 
that is the important fact of this one.
