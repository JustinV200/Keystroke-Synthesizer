     Teamwork makes the dream work. That is a true statement and many people benefit from working as a team successfully. Cooperation with others can be more benefical. Work can be split up into different sections like back in school when you worked on a group project. It's not as stressful and a little less time consuming than competition. Cooperation can boost skills in team members like leadership, organization, communication, problem solving, listening and decision making. At a job most people are working to achieve the same goal, except when their is a promotion involved. The only downfall with teamwork is you usually find at least one person who is not working like the other members. I have worked in a few teams, especially in school, where I was most productive.

     On the other hand, some competition can be healthy as well. Competition can create new ideas on how to get a project done. A light competition within a group could both be harmful and helpful. Everyone has different ideas and most tend to side with the best one which can cause resentment to a member that does not agree or feels their way is better. A group could try all ideas and see which works most efficiently. Like in childhood competition can be harmful to one's self-confidence and self esteem. Everyone feels proud when they are a winner but when everyone is a winner it's not a competition.

     While I agree either or can acheive more success, I personally would rather work as a team to get projects done quicker. I do not mind everyone receiving credit but I take it personal when there is a member that is not as productive. This question can go either way depending on who is asked and what their traits are. A self-oriented person would rather compete to satisfy their own personality trait. A team player would be the exact opposite. Teamwork will always make the dream work.
