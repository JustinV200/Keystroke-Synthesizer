
 I believe that people will be happier if they focus on their own personal goals rather than on the happiness of others. I really wish and hope that this is the other way around, but I feel that individual happiness is more in line with human nature.

I base this opinion on reviewing and reading about capitalism versus communism or socialism. i sincerely believe that it is better to act for the good of the many, but the success of capitalism seems to prove me wrong. How often have we seen communist systems collapse because people are unwilling to put up with collectivist economies?  The Chinese system seemed to work much better when it let people keep the money they made instead of working for the motherland. How many millionaires have risen in this country by working for their own benefit rather than for others? Why did the Soviet system suddenly collapse in the 90s? People were fed up with not getting what they want. 

There are some who argue that personal happiness is not the way to go. They can put forth the case of mothers and children, or people who are in health services. I admit there is a strong altruistic impulse in humans, but argue it is not strong enough to counteract our natural desire for individual happiness. Mothers raise children who go on to become CEOs or lawyers.

In conclusion, I feel, regrettably, that human nature is individualistic, not collectivist.
