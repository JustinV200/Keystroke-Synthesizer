In our world, rampant with social media and fake news, impressions can make more of an impact than reality. Too often, people respond to what is "bright and shiny" and eye-catching rather than diving deeper to truly assess an item or a person. 

For me, the Khardashians epitomize this situation. I don't believe any of them have true talent other than their ability to market themselves. Mother Chris Jenner seized upon their notoriety because daughter Kim had a sex video go viral on social media. Is that the best way to become famous? Following that, the family starred in reality shows putting their lives into the public eyes. Now their marriages, chidren, divorces and endeavors are closely monitored and seized upon by the public.

It might be said that all of this information being shoved at us is valuable because it opens our minds to all avenues of thought and images. It creates memorable figures who might be beautiful and desirable. However, our society is too prone to admiration in people with little or no true substance. 

My wish is that people in the world would take a moment to consider what they admire and value about the reality stars, sports figures and luxury brands that they covet or want to know more about. What are these people and objects doing to make their mark on society? Are they making any contributions to the world or just having their moment in the spotlight? Wouldn't it be better to admire the media-absent people who are making meaningful improvements to society? My prediction is that a century from now, no one will care who the Kardashians were or will wonder why they were so admired.
