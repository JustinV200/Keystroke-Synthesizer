Images and impressions have a great and negative effect on people. People often become wrapped up in the ads and the "snake oil" that companies are trying to sell them, without really knowing anything about the product, and never realizing that the people that are depicted in these ads are not so perfect themselves.

So many people want to lose weight or look a certain way and with social media in our lives now, we want this even more. We see depictions of perfect looking people on TikTok and Instagram and we want that and are willing to buy products that these influencers are selling in order to look like this. However, often, these products are nothing more than empty promises of doing something for our body but never following through. Certain face creams and serums are sold under the premise that it will get rid of wrinkles but we never see resuls. Certain weight loss pills or vitamins are shown to us and promises to help us lose weight, but we don't see any real results with just this pill. These pills and serums never have any clinically proven ingredients in them that have actually shown real results within people. 

These social media influencers such as Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian are often photoshopped and do not even look like this themselves, but we fall for the premise of what they are selling. We believe it is important to strive to look like a perfect image on a computer screen, never realizing our true self worth. 

To conclude, we look at people on social media and want to look just like that person, but what we don't realize is that the images of those people are photoshopped and made to look better than what they do. The reason for doing this is so that we buy what they are selling in hopes of looking just as good but never realizing that these people have flaws as well. We must embrace these things and realize that as long as we are healthy, certain flaws that we may have are normal and OK!
