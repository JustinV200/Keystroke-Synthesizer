      Yes, We should criticize our modern society for being materialistic. Now a days, people are giving so much importance to money and unwanted stuff instead of giving importance to relationships. They are spending their money on things which are not useful for them in any way, which is to show their wealth to other people. Our people are earning money by working hard but simply wasting it by spending it on purchases of different things.
      Our society plays a vital role in this issue, most of the people deciding and making their relationships with others based on their wealth and their outlook. They are depending on these wealthy people always and using them for their own growth. They are living in the shadows of these wealthy people. People in this modern society need to be blamed for being materialistic.
      People in previous generations gave much importance to relationships. But, new inventions of different things made it easy for them to achieve everything in their life. Previously, people were depending on each other to achieve the goals of each other. But they are depending on technologies to get whatever they want. We have to blame the scientists for creating this modern society as it resulted it in creating materialistic society.
