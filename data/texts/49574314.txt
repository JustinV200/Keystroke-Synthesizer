    Both cooperation and competition can be excellent motivators for success. Some people work better with peers to bounce ideas off of, while others thrive when competing to complete a project or task. Which factor is the greatest motivator is often a matter of the individual personalities, the details of the task, and the promised or expected reward for completion. In my opinion, cooperation is generally a better method of achieving success than competition.
    Competition has its place as an excellent motivator when talking about certain goals such as individual sports or business ventures, for instance. Some people perform at their best when they are attempting to 'beat out' or do better than the next person. The competivitive spirit can inspire ideas and performances that may not otherwise manifest without the thrill of winning. On the other hand, cooperation can give task participants the option for a group of their peers to contribute ideas and improve them. When people cooperate, they are often able to accomplish things that are difficult or impossible to achieve alone. Cooperation gives each person a voice, and supports that voice when necessary, to complete a goal. 
    I believe that cooperation leads to greater success and achievement than competition. In today's world, with its complexity of tasks, cooperation seems to be the better choice for accomplishment than attempting to do things alone. Additionaly, I see cooperation as an aspirational goal. We are better humans when we care about each other. Cooperation amongst and between us all is a step in the right direction to make this world a better place and accomplish great things.
