     Some could say that a person will only truly be happy once they have everything they have ever needed. This is true in a certain sense. However, what if the one thing that person wants is for the others around them to be happy or for the world to be a better place?
     There are different kinds of people in this world that are made happy by different things. Some are things that make them feel better, some are things that make them look better, and some are things that they just want to do. However, if that one person is happy and all the people who are important to them are unhappy around them, how can they truly be happy? The saying, "Misery loves company," would apply to this situation. Every person in this world has someone who is just as important to them as they are to themselves. If that one person is not happy by decisions they make, they will change their choices into something that can suit both themselves and the person they love. This tells me that inherently, people are not as selfish as they are viewed to be. When it comes down to a situation, most will choose a way to please instead of focusing on their own personal goals. 
     Selfish is something that most people in this world are familiar with. Most will make decisions that suit themselves over people they don't know. However, when people are faced with a choice to make themselves happy or the one person they truly love happy, selfish goes right out the window.
