Modern society critisized for being materialistic!

modern society is being critisized because electronics are taking over the world we once knew as old school.

we all spend money on a daily basis in grocery stores, on movie tickets, even to eat out. the point is to do away with electronics but most modern day people thats all they know.the older generations hate that and i get that but everyone needs to get off that high horse and learn to update their brains to todays economical standpoint.

theres are phone laptops and computers everyone owns one or the other. you should have a right to choose if you want to stay old school or live modern however old school is not how every one wants to live so dont push it on others. if you like your lifestyle great keep it the way it is.

we should all let each other live our lives happy. no need to judge someone because they have the new iphone and you dont. we all have the same equipment one way or another we might just not get it as fast as the other if they are rich. things are expensive and hard to come by you will get there just have patience.

there is no way i believe modern society should be critisized  for being materialistic since im from the younger generation. theres is a way for this world to live in both peace and harmoney regardless of the fact you want electronics or not. we all have something more important to argue over than modern day materials.
