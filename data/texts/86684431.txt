   Materialism is the new trend of the 21st century and it is in our faces everywhere and everyday.  Every time we turn around there is an ad or a billboard persuading us to buy the newest product or fad and it is inescapable.  While this fact can't be disputed, modern society should not be criticized for being materalistic because for many material things bring happiness, helps boost the economy and is a sign of wealth and success.

First, material things bring happiness and joy to people and helps with self-esteem and confidence. Many people struggle on a daily basis financially and emotionally however when they can afford to buy the newest pair of shoes or clothing item, this can make someone feel good about themself and help boost their self-esteem.  

   Second, materialism helps boost the economy.  When you have more people buying and consuming things, you need more workers to produce those items.  This creates more jobs and affords people the ability to buy and consume more items.

Finally, materialism is a sign of wealth and success. While material things shouldn't dictate that you are successful,  driving the newest car or buying a big house is often the end result that you are successful financially. It makes people feel good when they have achieved a goal they set especially when in the previous decades so many of our ancestors struggled to make ends meet.

In conclusion while materialism may be looked down upon, modern society should not be criticized for being too materialistic because material things bring happiness, boost the economy, and is a sign of wealth and success.
