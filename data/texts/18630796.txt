Cooperation and competition are always the things that have pushed mankind to do great things. Although they are fundamentally different from each other they both do the same thing which is to motivate people in achieving great things.

It is true that we humans have built our entire society by cooperating with each other and we have been ever since doing it and keeping the economy and the society in a harmonious balance. It is undoubtly a fact that people can do great things when they try to do something together. But the principal can apply for a rival. Peoples' greatest works have always been inspired by some other rival may it be to catch up with them or it may be to stay ahead of them it is evident competition is also a important aspect for people to succeed. Both have their own sets of benifits. So it should be noted that while one may be a bit more benificial than the other, it doesn't mean that the other one is completely bad either.

If we were to choose between cooperation or competition in terms of success, it'd be better to go with cooperation. It is a trusted and tried method, if likeminded people cooperate with other while having a universal goal to work towards, nothing can stop them. While competition may force one to do better, it doesn't allow one to fix their mistakes after making them, they may realize it after a long time but it results in slow improvement. Whereas in a team people helps each other out by pointing mistakes and helping them overcome it and become better.
