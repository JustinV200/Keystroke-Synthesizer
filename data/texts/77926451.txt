Nowadays people have to put too much of an effect on people. So that only everyone will get success on their own life. I am working as a supervisor in my company. There are lot of competition to get success in my life. I am facing lot of difficulties to achieve my goals. My opposition will give some struggle to achieve my goal. So I will show my best result to get success in my life. I am working hard in my company as putting too much effect on people to achieve my team performance. Based on the performance, We will get appreciation by their own effect.
My team member will put more effect on their work. Day and night we are working hard on the project. We will submit our project on time. Our manager will review my project if it is approved we will get success and appreciation by our lead. My main goal is to become a high position in my company. So I have to work hard to success in my carreer. I have to lead my team to show best performance in my organization. Sometimes I can't able to spend time with my family. My full focus with my goal. Once it is achieved I have felt very happy on that moment. My family member will give some support to get success part of my goal. Thank you for this opportunity to share my wonderful thoughts.
