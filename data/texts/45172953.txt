         In our world and especially in the United States image is everything. There is so much imagary around us that we just become accustom to it and on some level do not realize that in many ways the images are consistantly affecting us on a subconcious level. 

           I absolutely believe that we are to reliant to much on imagery. As an outdoor enthusiest and a primitive survival teacher. I know that a person can use imagery to protect themselves from animals. An example would be a Bouma which is a barrier placed around your shelter. These barriers are made up of nothing more than branches and other forest debri and in fact provides no actual protection as any preditor could easily break through. But for an animals perseption is reallity and in all most all cases will not even attempt to break through.

           I feel that on many levels there is no exceptions for Humans as we are part of the animal kingdom. In many ways for us our perception is also our reality which I believe is part of the human condition.

          As far as there being to much. I think that this in many ways is part of all eco systems and entirely natural that it would be used in our ecosystem as well. However when it is simply used as a form of munipulation I believe it becomes for lack of better words "unkind" and "preditory". However at the end of the day.... "Buyer be wear!!!". It is our responsibility to challange images and the claims they present to find the truth and if it is found that a company or product is using this to misrepresent themselves then our recourse (or even responsibility and duty) is to boycott that product and company and hold the companies responsible for these unkind and preditory misrepresentions buy withholding our business.
