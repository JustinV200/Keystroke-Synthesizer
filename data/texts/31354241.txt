Success is achieved in greater measure through cooperation rather than competition.  Cooperation leads to great success for both a society as well as individuals. 
 
Cooperation puts more minds together to solve problems and overcome obstacles.  They can build ideas off of each other and expand on thoughts in a way that is rarely possible in competition. Brainstorming in a group leads to participants bouncing ideas off each other and inspiring new evolutions of ideas.  This leads to leaps forward to success. People can encourage each other and bouy lagging spirits to stay engaged in a problem. This contributes to success. 

Competition can spur individuals on to faster speeds or greater heights, but often limits participation or produces short term gains.  The drive to win, spite or other emotion can propel one forward, but these emotions are often short lived or wane over time.  This may lead to a success that is temporary or a fleeting achievement. 

Cooperation moves society forward in a way that is inclusive, wheras competition is often devisive. Competative success is often individual while cooperative success in almost by definition communal.   Competative achievements may have been able to be realized sooner through cooperation. Cooperation leads to a greater and more longer lasting success.
