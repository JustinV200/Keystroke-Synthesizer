People like to say that first impressions matter significantly then turn right around and tell you that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Which one holds the most truth? It seems that in today's society the former expression bears far more weight. All around us are colorfully misleading advertisements, designer clothing meant to thrown away, politicians who appear clean and proper yet who are anything but, and social media "influencers" taking selfies for their followers. The lack of depth is seemingly apparent, yet people still ignorantly idolize, admire, and beleive the false image put on display for them and that is a very damaging aspect of society. 
Truth and justice suffer when people fail to look beneath the surface. Just because a politician has an award winning smile and takes a stance on an issue you agree with doesn't mean they're infallible. Regardless of party, many politicans have been caught up in scandals where they're doing the very thing they so adamantly fought against; they say one thing, yet thier voting records indicate another. It's not even that far below the surface, all you have to do is look a little deeper. Many corporations have gotten caught up in legal suits for false advertising, sometimes so nefarious that people have been seriously hurt or killed because of. In less severe cases it can lead to disappointment and even insecurity. Imagine that self-conscious teenager realizing that fancy face wash they bought didn't miraculously cure their acne. Them thinking that it worked for the other kids in the commercial so it must be something wrong with them so they hide behind a mask of makeup not realizing that is exactly how the advertisers made the "other kids" market their product. Sadly, this same teenager may very likely open their Instagram and see influencers whose lives appear to be so perfect. Many ex-influencers themselves have revealed that it's all a farce and they were never happy. 

I didn't finish :(
