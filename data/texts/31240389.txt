Yes, I agree. Modern society be criticized for being materialistic. Everyone will be give respect based on their outcome and status. Higher level person will buy brand materials and spending more money. But Low level person will be more criticized for being materialistic. Based on the materials and status, everyone will  be treated equally and depending on the outcome people will be treated fairly.
High level peoples will be spending more money and living their own life. But low level peoples will be can't able to sustain their life because of criticizing by the society. We have to monitor their dependency for spend most of our energy producing it will be helpful to their society.  
Everyone wants money to lives their life happily. It will be helpful to sustain in the life. I am very much happy to share my thoughts about criticizing by society. It's depends on the social status. Being materialistic peoples can be judged in this country. I am not interested in spending more money in materialistic. I can be save my money for my future and my family members. I have lot of goals to do. So I have to save my money to become rich people. So only my future generations will be safe. Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts about materialistic.
