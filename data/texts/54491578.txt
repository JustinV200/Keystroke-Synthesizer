     Material Girl isn't just a catchy tune from the eighty's, over time it's namesake and inuendo has come to be a badge worn loudly and proudly and become a real aspect of life in modern society. Worldy possesions and the cost to aquire them are equavilent status symbols in most societies today. 

     That begs the question: should modern society be criticized for being too materialistic? Are we doing this all wrong?  In short: no, we aren't doing anything wrong; nor are we doing anything much different than mankind has done since the beginning of time. Ancient Egyptians adorned their kings and queens in lavish garments, headresses, and even buried them with gold and other artifacts of that era that were considered to be rare and extravegant to set them apart from the layman.
The Roytal family, The President of the United States, and The Pope of the Catholic church all reside in dwelings akin to mansions and palaces because that is part of their status and who they are at that momwent in time.

     It can be argued that materialism is for shallow people and that you should be able to look past letting what you have define who you are. But it would be my bet that if I were to sit and chat about this topic with those same people who would argue that point would go right back to scrolling Twitter on their new iphone as they wait for valet to bring their car around after brunch.
