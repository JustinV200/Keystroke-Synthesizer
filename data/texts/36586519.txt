Many people get fooled by advertisements and the opinons of others that look nice and pretty without being able to see the substance within. Companies try to pump out a beautiful product that will literally kill you and only have a label that is hidden that says so. I believe a person's or brand's image has too much affect on people.
People get lost in what the media or public opinion tells us to be, that creates a distraction to the activity that is finding ourselves, and actively becomes a barrier for anyone trying to learn who you truly are.

The image of who you are does not need to be a reflection of someone else. You should not do something because someone you love or respect is doing it. Following people you believe in is good, but there needs to be an inner dialogue that makes you wonder if you are doing this for you or for them. Celebrities' and companies' public relations teams put out things that get the most hits and dont care about the individuals that are following them or that want to be like them. Don't respect and follow someone for what they have or what they wear, do it for what they believe in.

It's ok to follow those you care for but it needs to be in moderation, everyone is different and you cant forget your uniqueness that makes you who you are. We cant get lost in all the frill and grandiosity that is constantly shoved down our throats at everywaking moment. There is over 7 billion people on this earth at this moment, aren't you are similar enough to someone as it is?
