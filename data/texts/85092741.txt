The United States is largely an individualistic nation and culture, and capitalism promotes intense competition between each other. However, cooperation and team work is more likely to produce better results and lasting achievement. Working in collaboration with others allows the sharing of ideas and encourages team members to work off of each other.

This can be thought about in relation the language of team sports. In a game of football or soccer, for example, it would be much more difficult to win or achieve the same results or scores if each player was focused on their own achievement. Team work is absolutely necessary in order for a team to win. They must be willing to pass the ball when needed and know when to pass the torch to allow others to succeed, even if it takes away their spotlight, because it is for the best for the team.

In work settings, many individuals are forced to work in a competitive setting, comparing results or outcomes between coworkers. However, if these employees were encouraged to work together to brain storm how productivity can be increased together, it would certainly be interesting to see how outcomes would compare. I would expect that the results would be similar, if not better, than working in a competitive environment. Overall, people do achieve greater success through cooperation rather than through competition. This has also been shown in other countries, specifically in Europe, that are much less competition-driven than the United States; when societies are built with more of a community focus rather than an individual focus, health, happiness, and well-being outcomes are improved across the board for citizens.
