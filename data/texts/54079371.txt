The magic formula for human happiness, and even contentment, is elusive.
Personally, I feel happiness deepest, truest and most honestly when I am satisfying my dreams and marking my days with little, small happinesses. But what of the people who reap their own happiness from what they sow for others. Is that the way to do it? Have I had the wrong idea this entire time?
It stands to reason that most people who have evolved in their lifetimes to have a strong set of morals, would indeed be prioritizing the well-being of others and of humanity, alongside their own. And that balance would lead to a more well-rounded and realistic idea of happiness.
The idea that happiness can be achieved entirely on one's own, by prioritizing their own dreams and goals and nothing else, seems a little flighty at times. It could lead to a misrepresentation of what it really means to be happy. The kind of, "I've got all of this success and no one to share it with," type gig.
It could be argued that that's not the way to achieve joy just as easily it could be argued that it is. After all, you come into the world alone and you leave it alone. That is the inevitable. Why should happiness be anything other than living for yourself?
I'm inclined to think that you can find your version of happiness, no matter which path you choose to reach it. I think the number one way to ensure unhappiness would be to constantly worry that some other method could make us happier.
