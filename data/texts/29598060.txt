In today's world, the only true way to achieve success is through cooperation.  While competition is effective in some venues, it is short lived and is not effective in all circumstances.

For a company to be successful, there is little place for competition between employees.  This will only create animocity among employees.  If the employees cooperate with each other, in achieving the company goal/mission, the company will prosper and thrive.  If you consider the situation of a sports team, cooperation is essential for the team to work as a cohesive entity.  If teammates compete against one another during a game the team is sure to loose.

If employees or teammates are competing against one another, some might say that this competion will drive the weaker employees to excel.  This may be true for a short period of time.  The weaker employees will not be able to sustain this momentum for an extended period of time.  They will soon fall behind and become discouraged.

Therefore, cooperation is the most logical method to achieve a fully successful company or team.  With cooperation all are encouraged to contribute.  The success is felt by all involved and no one is left behind.  There will always be employees that are high achievers and ones that are normal achievers.  With cooperation all are encouraged to contribute and success is felt by all.
