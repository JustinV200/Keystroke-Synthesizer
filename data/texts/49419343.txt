     Happiness is a state of joy where an individual feels happy and contented with everything around them. most people have different ways of feeling or finding their happineness and that varies from one person to another. It is rare to find someone comepletely happy in all aspects of life. one should work towards making themselves and others happy.
     I find my happiness in partly making others happy, and making myself happy at the same time. I look for activities that enhance my happiness and do them while not interfering with any other person's happiness. Activities like donations and giving back to society make other people happy while i find sastifaction in giving, this is an example on how i make myself, and other people happy at the same time.
     People often refer happiness to be a facial expression, i say hapiness is a state of mind, feeling calm, accomplished and always motivated to be better and making other people better around you. when one finds happiness they work better, have healthy relationships and appreciate life more, they enjoy life as they are very healthy in the mind.
     Although we may assume that by trying to make other people happy they will automatically be happy, the human nature is very hard to please, most people in the process of making them happy may choose to want more and more and they end up frustrating you and you end up miserable. 
    True happiness comes from within a person, if you accomplish your goals, work on yourself and improve on your shortcomings, spend time around people who make you feel happy and do things that fulfil you from within, that is when one can find happiness because it is hard to make other people happy. Being happy is a choice that one can make and pursue.
