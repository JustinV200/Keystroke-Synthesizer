It is impossible to know the true meaning of happiness.  This is because happiness means a million different things to a million different people.  We all have our own version of what happiness means to us.  For some, happiness means focusing on others and their happiness.  For others, happiness is focusing on themselves and achieving personal goals.  Although putting others ahead of ourselves is honorable and gracious, is it possible to find happiness with other's joy when we are not truly happy with ourselves?

Our goals and what we wish to achieve in this life are the things that mold us into who are and who we will be.  It could be said that focusing on ourselves is a selfish act, but couldn't the same be said for trying to push someone else's happiness for solely our benefit? For us to truly be happy, we must work on improving ourselves.  If you are a kind person you will want others to be happy and want our communities and humanity as a whole to thrive and improve.  This does not mean that you do not matter, that your goals do not matter and you should give up who you want to become and what you want to achieve.  You are allowed to focus and improve yourself and put yourself ahead of others because at the end of the day you have to live with yourself.

Happiness is important.  A thriving career, traveling experiences, and special hobbies are all things that focus on special interests and goals.  They are also things that create well-rounded individuals.  Working on ourselves and creating our own happiness creates healthy individuals that in turn want to give back to their communities and share their happiness within the world. Being happy spreads throughout our selves and has the capability to flow into other's lives bringing joy and happiness to others.
