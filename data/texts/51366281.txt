Happiness can come from many sources. Personal goals and ambitions are things everyone has, and completion or efforts towards those goals can give people happiness. Happiness can also come from helping others and giving energy towards people other then strictly oneself. While both are true, personal goals will end up giving more happiness, since the people that find the most happiness in helping others, most likely have it high on their personal goal list.

This is why personal goal will end up giving more happiness overall. To people that are selfish and only think and care about themselves,  they will always focus on self improving and obtaining the goals they have set for themselves. This will bring them happiness. For people that find happiness in dealing with others, improving others lives, helping the needy, they will do those things and find happiness there. These are things that could be part of their own personal goals. There own personal goals could be wanting to help others, meaning their own goals for happiness are the happiness of others. So both the selfish person and the selfless person are the happiest when they are trying to obtain their own personal goals.

The happiness of people can come from different sources, but even in the case of a person that always tries to improve the happiness of other, they themselves are happy in the process. Truely selfish people may never be happy only focusing on helping others. But if they focus on themselves they will be. A person that wants to only help others, will in turn be happy by doing so. They themselves are giving themselves happiness by giving others happiness. The end result is that everyone should be focused on their own goals and their own desires for happiness since as a whole it is the most beneficial for everyone.
