People achieve more success by cooperation. Competition is a good trait, however, it only show glorification of current skills not skills needed to complete the task at hand.  Practice makes perfect.

You can have great sucesses in life using competition as a motivator. However, without cooperation there would be no need for competition. A person can cooperate without competition, but competing might make it more fun.

Competition is a glorified way of showing who is dominant in a particular task or sport.  Look at a football team for an example. It is a competition sport that will only succeed if the entire team cooperates.  It takes more than one player to get that ball to the endzone. The success of the team is dependent on the cooperation of the players working together. Each player on the field has their own responsibility with a common goal, to win or have fun.

Now lets take a look at an individualized sport such as tennis. One on one. However without the cooperation of sponsors, trainers, families, and venues this wouldn't be a success at all.  Also without the cooperation of the opponent you wouldn't even be able to practice efficiently.  

I mean don't get me wrong, there are sometimes where competition would reign, as far as successes go but they are far and few between. But with God all things are possible. He is the original one man team. I mean yes you could do anything by yourself, but without the cooperation of literally everyone, everything, and God it would be next to impossible to have any successes at all.
