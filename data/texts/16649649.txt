People tend to be happier when focusing on others' needs because love really means willing the good of the other as other, according to some theologians.

It seems that putting an arm around someone who needs help or support is a good way to forget my problems and focus on another person's problems. I saw a comment about this on an NCIS episode and it was trying to get one person with emotional stress to help another person with deeper emotional stress. It worked! It helped both people work through the issues and get to a happier state. They were not completely healed; however, both could move forward and get back to a more normal routine.  When I had some overwhelming life crisis, I had to help a friend in crisis at the same time. The results were that I worked through my issues by helping my friend work through hers. We became even closer and it has been a source of satisfaction for me, a sense of accomplishment for getting through my situation and watching my friend grow in confidence.

She had been focused on her situation at the exclusion of family and friends and was getting more depressed. I had been focused on how to remedy my adverse situation and was not getting anywhere. When her situation presented itself to me, it wasn't a direction that I wanted to go at the time, but she needed my help immediately. It just was the right thing to do.

By focusing on my friend's situation I put my issues in the background. I found at the end of the day that, when her situation improved, I was happy for her and I was happier and able to move forward again along with my friend.
