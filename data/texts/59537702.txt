To be honest I believe an impression can merely offer people a vague contour of a person on what we see but won't always unchangeable as long as we delve into the deep side of a person character and figure appearing.I feel everyone is unique in their own way and image.Most have lack of systematic way to assess the effectiveness on how the view things.Apperances plays a huge role in reality in which we should have a visual of all things that happen to appears to us.There will be a lot of flase advertising from the things we see.For examples salt look like sugar but taste are different so the apperances mistaken for reality.

Certian entertainers interested others from the things we enoy seeing for example arts.In which there are many different patern,textures,designs,colors.image and etc whcih we base on our likely.Without those materials and items we as human won't be able to see the beauty of art.So we mostly mistaken the apperances of art as reality and especially far as the image art present itself to us as a differnet point of views.Their are ability to understand that ust because something looks like something else from what it isn't what it seems.

I truly belive images and impressions have to much of an effect on people from how they see certain things such as something we see on tv compare to what we see in real life.We tend to see things different in real life compare to a tv screen or a computer especially when you on facetime when someone at the store showing a items look so big but when that items appear in person it is not the same and image are different sizes and shape.Shape is not what we see it is something interfere from what we see and what we see is constantly changing in shape as we move around.
