Have you ever judged a book by its cover? A product by its packaging? How about voted for someone because they made you all of these promises only to turn their backs on all of them? This is intentional. These people and corporations are purposely telling us to believe everything we see. They are liars.

I couldn't tell you how many times I've been fooled by restaurant advertisements. Their products are always advertised as this structured, perfectly cooked item, only for you to buy it and it's soggy and cold. Did you know that a lot of the time those ads don't feature real food? I was shocked to find that out, but when i really think about it: should I really have been all that surprised?

This isn't always fact, though. Some public figures showcase who they actually are. This may not necessarily be a positive though, seeing how most of these people have terrible attitudes and don't know how to stay out of controversies. Famous rapper, Azealia Banks, being a prime example of this. She speaks her mind and doesn't care if you disagree!

To sum up, don't expect something to be a worthy product or someone to be a nice person just because they lead you to believe them. It's all about the money. Corporations lie. People lie. Trust yourself.
