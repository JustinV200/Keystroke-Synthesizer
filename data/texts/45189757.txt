We eat with our eyes first. We judge books by their covers. Advertising and marketing employees make sure that their design is the most eye-catching product available on the shelf. We are magpies with an eye for shining things. Our culture values materialism and attractiveness more than it values truth, leading to an uneven bias toward appearance.

Even as small children, we are exposed to advertisements. On children's TV channels, you can find advertisements during every programming block. These ads often consist of toys, activities, or technologies that a child might be taught to be interested in. We are shown the most attractive products, people, and scenarios. Everything is colorful; everything looks "cool." There are sounds and colors and lights. The ads make us want to be cool and colorful, too. We want to have the products that all the other children have. 

 Because we were conditioned to feel drawn to the most attractive people and objects as children, we continue to feel an unconscious bias toward those beautiful people and objeects. Beauty and perfection are more "cool," more comforting. They are the social norm. We think that because an object looks good, it must be better, more correct, and more trustworthy. We are never taught to think critically about what might lie beneath that potentially superficial facade. 

Because we are conditioned by a society whose social hierarchy is based on appearance,  
As a society, we are conditioned to be drawn to clever and attractive marketing campaigns rather than give people and products a fair chance.
