                                                          Real or Unreal, that is the question...

                        There are so many reasons to believe that images and impressions have too much of an effect on people. I know so many women in particular, who have felt that they were not pretty enough  to get a certain job. If only they had the right dress or outfit that would make them more attractive. It happens in all different types of industries, where people feel that they have to look a certain way to get any attention at all. To represent a kind of image is very important in todays society.
                      Most of all social media outlets show people doing whatever it takes to look like they are living a type of way. People want to show how well they are doing by what they have. It could be a nice car or a nice looking partner. They also are showing how good their bodies look. That usually makes others want to keep up and do the same.
                      This way of thinking and doing totally effects what we do to be seen and or heard. I don't think it's going to get any better because it seems thats the common goal of most people. The way people present themselves in pictures and on social media videos is becoming extremely important in how we are viewed by others, So far, the bigger and brighter seems to be the better choice. Most people are going in that direction.
                    Time will tell if this trend of trying to be something we are not will continue. My guess is that it will still be a thing for many years to come. The human ego seems to have a thirst for trying to be seen as more than they actually are. Entertainers and public figures have a specific purpose to show themselves as having a lot and being on the top of the chain of popularity and with that comes a lot of pretending.
