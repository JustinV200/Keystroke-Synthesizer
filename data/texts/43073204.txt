Modern society should be criticized for being so materialistic or should it ?  Materials are everywhere. Materials are easy to obtain. we work hard to obtain things and have stuff. its a difficult question to answer. we have dreams of having things. our fathers and fathers before those fathers found great joy in things and having materials. Being materialistic can mean happiness for some and unhappiness for others.

Many people around the world work hard and for many long hours to create and imagine and then bring to life many wonderful things for us to obtain. Being materialistic doesnt have to be such a bad thing. purchasing things keeps people employed and many people find joy in work and having things. The money goes around and keeps the economy doing alright.

Many argue that materialistic behavior is bad and damaging to the world.  too much consumption is evil or not good. the world doesnt need so much stuff. Many things only end up in our landfills and garbage is everywhere. Most people neither use or need the many of  things they have. Materialistic behavior is just over consumption.

These arguements are all valid in my opinion. I think everyone is right. There has to be a middle ground. I think with some education and wisdom, we all could meet in the middle.  Knowing that being materialistic can be wasteful is a start. Knowing that having things and being able to purchase things can bring joy to people; is also a start. Many new ideas have formed around the issue and people are doing things about it, for example reusing and recycling, educating themselves and others.

Should modern society be critized for being materialistic? maybe not. Because society has recognized it as a problem and have initiated steps to make it less of a problem. Modern society makes mistakes and in my opinion people always try to make things better overall.  Perhaps criticism if any, over materialism shouldnt be so harsh.
