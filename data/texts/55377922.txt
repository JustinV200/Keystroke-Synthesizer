I don't think that modern society should be criticized for being materialistic but I think there should be a limit on how materialistic we should allow ourselves to be. Materialism has helped societies to progress technologically. Societies have progressed, and continue to progress extremely rapidly every day from being materialistic technologically. I read somewhere that for every single day that passes, humans have progressed more technologically in one day than the past twenty years, and that keeps going on for every single day that passes.

That's pretty incredible when you think about it. Our technological advancements have allowed and continue to allow us to produce many different types of materials that help us in our daily lives and that also give us pleasure in some way. I don't think we should be extremely materialistic since life is not just about having material things but mainly about the experience from using those materials. 

One could say that people who are materialistic are shallow and don't value the deeper meaning of life, but I beg to differ with that because without materalism, we couldn't enjoy simple things such as having a comfortable and safe home to live in, a vehicle for transporation, food that gives us nutrition and pleasure and various other products that help us daily in some way along with enjoyment. I'm all for materialism to some extent in order to enjoy life and society will continue to be materalistic to some degree because it's impossible not to be since we live in a physical and material world. Modern society will always progress in every way from being materalistic.
