Images and impressions too often do not tell the whole story.  How many times have you been wrong about a first impression that lead to an incorrect assumption?  Our society as a whole bases too much on outward appearances.  We are all guilty of it, even if we don't want to admit it.

Our American capitalist society is based on how we appear to others and how can we impress others.  We are bombarded daily with advertisments for clothing, makeup, the newest and latest technology devices.  These ads may tout their products as helping us time wise and making our lives easier, but is that the real reason we are always striving to have these things?  Or is it because we want to look better to other people?  The Prada purse and diamonds and latest Iphone and luxury car show others the level of our "success."  Isn't that really why we want those things?  Having these status things impress other people, and first impressions are lasting impressions.  But are they correct impressions?  Right or wrong people make assumptions about you based on these impressions without getting to know the person.  They may be the opposite as what the person really is inside.  

Even though first impressions are lasting, they are not always correct.  The person with the expesive car dripping in diamonds and furs may be a liar and horrible person, and the homeless man you see begging on the street could be the kindest soul you will ever meet.  Don't let their images and impression dupe you into thinking the wrong thing.
