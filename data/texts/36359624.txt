I think that people achieve more success with cooperation since there are more minds to focus and figure out their problem. "Two heads is better than one.", as they say and that's my point. I think that most of human history shows that the more people work together towards one goal, the better the outcome and solution is because more ideas are thrown around and people can bounce off of each other's ideas and evaluate, compare, discard and keep any relevant, interesting and decent to good ideas that were formed.

An example of success with cooperation is the United States space program, NASA, and how many people work together doing different tasks and help each other figure out and solve any problems that come arise. Clearly, NASA was successful in figuring out on how to get a man to walk on the moon with the efforts of many people. There's also been cooperation in the development of a country, company or any development of a product or service. No single person can do everything by themselves no matter how smart they are.


While competition does spur people into engaging in figuring out ideas to do better than the other person or group of people, I don't think it has the same positive effect as success by cooperation has. Nothing great would've been built by humans without cooperation and it will always be this way. Even when someone is a genius, or has an ingenius idea, they still need other people to help them to develop their idea in some way. I can't think of any truly good reason that success by competition would be better than success by cooperation. That's my stance on this topic and I truly believe in success by cooperation.
