Yes , modern society should be criticized for being materialistic. Because now a days people are being very materialistic in everything like if they expressed their love or show their concern to another person is being materialistic.To impressed our loved ones is not based on materials , it was filled with our abundance of love.
For example, one man is going to propose his girlfriend , he impress the girl with costly product like ring, mobile, etc.., It is called as materialism. Another example if anyone succeed in their life , they celebrates their success with spending money on valuable materials or partying with friends,etc.., It is also the example of materialism.In the olden age , People were not being materialistic, they showered their love with their own  poetry or using their mind to impressed anyone. So being materialistic is not very important for modern society.
Now, Being materialistic in something is not wrong. But being materialistic in every single work of their life is boring and it also reduces the knowledge of people. So everyone use their own knowledge to provide a gift to someone like own poetry , flower bouquet, using natural things. Finally being materialistic in the modern world doesn't make everyone looks wealthy ,majestic,etc. Everyone was not being impressed with materialism . So coming days, People will try not to being materialistic. It is not at all important thing to make our modern society better.
