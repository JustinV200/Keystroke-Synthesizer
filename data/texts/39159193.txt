Modern society is very materialistic.  Why do so many people need material things to make them happy?

Being taught by their parents that material things are important to keep up with the Jones'. If you can afford it and your neighbor has it you want it.  That is one of the worst feelings someone can have when you see another person copying you because they feel they have to have the same thing to make their life better. 

The car, the house, the fences, the computers the phones, the laptop etc.  These are material items that have just about destroyed our way of living and thinking.  Younger generations cannot add without a calculator.  They cannot think independently without searching it on the internet.  They are lazy because they do not go outside and get exercise.  Go outside get some sun and vitamin d it is not going to hurt you.  Modern society has become so materialistic you cannot accomplish your goals without having the most up to date and flashy item to do it with. Material things have destroyed our way of life.  We have to have the newest car, phone, laptop, game station. 

Yes modern society should be criticized for being materialistic.  Things are not what make you happy. It takes wisdom to understand material things are not what you are looking for.  The mind can be destroyed thinking they have to have what the other person has.  Be wise understand that material items are just that, material.  They cannot make you smile or laugh.
