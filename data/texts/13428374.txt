Modern society should not be criticized for emphasising materialism. Materilism is important for most developed nations. It helps drive people to want more out of life. I think it also makes people happy to be able to purchase the goods they desire. They will�work harder in order to accomplish this goal. It is good to "want". It also helps fuel the economy.

Everyone I know that has nice things is happy. They enjoy spending their hard-earned money on possessions.�It's a pleasure to own new things.��Personally, I�love to go out and spend money. It seems like a waste to just keep it in the bank. Money is made to be be spent.

I would encourage parents to teach their young children all about materialism. If they are taught young, they can grow up wanting to acquire belongings. That will help drive a more motivated work force. In turn, it will lead to happier and healthier people. I can speak from personal experience. I know that the more products I purchase, the more joy I will have in my life. The value of materialism should also be taught in schools. 
Schools should have a course or classes that demonstrate the value of materialism in society.
