   The simple things in life are what matter. This is something that I have heard and that at my core I believe. People are too often caught up in buying the latest and greatest model of many products, from clothes, to phones, to toys. Society needs to take a step back and analyze how much emphasis they put on materialism.

   I believe people could devote that time and energy spent on purchasing material things into something more useful or more satisfying. If you have the extra money, instead of buying another new shirt, why not donate to a charity. There is probably someone else out there that needs that new shirt more than you do. Instead of buying your son a new video game, take him out to the park and play a game with him. When he's older he won't remember that video game, but he will remember the time he spent with his parents, the time that they dedicated to him.

   Once we have too much of something, we seem to take it for granted, and we do not value it as much. Less is more. How can you decide which one is your favorite stuffed animal when you have twenty of them on your bed? We need to think about the things that are truly important in life. The problem is that many times we want more of something just to have more, it doesn't even give you any more pleasure, or it only makes you happy for a little while.

   One might say that purchasing what we want is our reward for working hard. We deserve to enjoy life, deserve to have the best and the most. Sure there is nothing wrong with purchasing something for yourself, but like I said, less is more. Will it really make you happier and help you sleep better? 

   Society should be criticized for being too materialistic. We need to wake up and realize that we are focusing on the wrong things in life. When you leave this life, you won't be able to take any of the possessions you acquired anyway, they are yours momentarily anyways.
