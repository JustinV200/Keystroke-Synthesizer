Modern society should be critizied for materialism. I think this because there are many different products thay exists to divide society into thinking that there is something special about different things. This essay exists to critique the existance of consuming things and making more products for the benefit of global capitalism. This essay will delve in the use of capitalism to drive greedy materialism. 

There are so many different products out there. Why do we need them all? There are uses sureley? No. They all end up in landfilld after people discard the or die. This is a huge waste as the items are never burried with these people like in chineese finerary culture. Instead of the items meaning something like this, they are simply discarded. 

Global capitaism is killing the earth. People buying materials make their carbon footprint larger. Do they actually need these? No. They need them to feel good about themselves. If we lived minimalist lives there would be a better society becuse thre would be a climate future. If we do not have a future then we will all die. This measn that global capitalism and materialims go hand in hand with killing the planet. How can we better this system? 

We must make people care less about material posettions? How do we do this: devalue things like expensive botiques like louis vuitton or balenciaga. These brands are extremeley wasteful and are there so peopel can make themselves feel better. To answer the question once again, yes modern day society should be deeply critizised for making the world a worse place off after materialims and maximalism.
